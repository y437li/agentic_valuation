Baird  Budd Bugatch - Raymond James Operator : Good morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Richard Galanti. Please go ahead sir. Richard Galanti : Thank you, operator, and good morning to everyone. This morning\u2019s press release reviews our first quarter earnings results for the 12 weeks ended November 24. As with every conference call, I\u2019ll start by stating that the discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. To begin with, for the quarter our reported earnings came in at $0.96 a share, compared to last year\u2019s earnings per share of $0.95. Several items of note that impacted the year over year comparison. I\u2019ll go through six items.  Membership fee increase, as I\u2019ve been mentioning for the last many quarters, the fee increase that we did in the U.S. and Canada in late 2011 and early 2012, that benefited this first quarter earnings by about $8 million pretax, or $0.01 a share. That will be the tail end of the benefit of that increase showing in our numbers. Interest expense was higher year over year in the first quarter by $14 million pretax or $0.02 a share. This of course related to last December\u2019s $3.5 billion debt offering in conjunction with the $7 per share special dividend. FX, in the first quarter the foreign currencies we operate in weakened versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in Canada and Japan. This resulted in our foreign earnings in the first quarter, when converted into U.S. dollars, being lower by about $14 million pretax or $0.02 a share than those earnings would have been, had FX exchange rates been flat year over year.  Gasoline profits, gas is a very good business for us. It drives frequency, we feel, and year over year it\u2019s always profitable, although it tends to be volatile. And the first quarter that impacted earnings by a little over $0.02 a share. Stock expense, that\u2019s a line item that we have in our SG&A, it was higher year over year in the first quarter by a little over $0.02 a share as well. We have over 4,000 people, generally managers and buyers and above, who receive restricted stock units as a significant part of their annual compensation.  Such grants are made annually each October, or in our first fiscal quarter. These RSU grants then typically vest over a five-year period, with accelerated vesting when a recipient reaches 25, 30, and 35 years of employment with the company. Now, factors driving this increase included a 24% increase year over year in our stock price on the dates in which the RSUs are granted each year, additional levels of accelerated vesting given many employees\u2019 long tenure with the company, and a large number of employees in the plan. I should note that this past October, our RSU grants were reduced by an average of around 15%. That is, the number of RSUs granted to each recipient. The increased expense occurred, of course, notwithstanding that reduction. IT modernization, talk again about that. We\u2019re in our probably second full year of a major modernization effort. And as discussed in the past several quarters, these efforts will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expense percentages throughout fiscal 2014 and probably a little beyond that, especially as the new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In the first quarter, on an incremental year over year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by about $12 million or about 3 basis points.  Turning to our sales for the first quarter, our 12-week reported comparable sales figures for the first quarter showed a 3% increase, 3% in the U.S. and 1% internationally. As indicated in our release, excluding a gas price deflation and the impact of FX, the 3% reported U.S. comp would have been 4% for the quarter. The 1% international would have been up 6%, and the over 3% for the company would have been plus 5% on a basis excluding gas deflation and FX. Other topics of interest, opening activities and plans, we opened 13 locations during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, 9 throughout the U.S., 1 in Alberta, Canada, 1 in Monterey, Mexico, our third in that city, and 2 new units in Australia, bringing Australia now to 5 total units in operation.  During the fiscal quarter, one location was closed, in Acapulco, Mexico. This was due to the extensive damage that resulted from the severe flooding down there from Tropical Storm Manuel. That may or may not reopen this fiscal year, but most likely certainly in calendar \u201914.  Since the end of the first quarter, we have opened in Q2 two new locations, one in Illinois and one in Canada, in Ontario. That gives us 15 new openings thus far in fiscal 2014. For the entire fiscal year, we have a current plan of 30 new locations, 16 of which are planned for the U.S., 4 in Australia, including the two we recently opened, 3 in Canada, 2 each in Korea, Japan, and Spain - and of course those would be our first two units in Spain - and one additional location in Mexico. I\u2019ll also discuss later in the call ecommerce activities, membership trends, and of course a discussion on the components of margin and SG&A. Again, quarterly results, total sales were up 5% to $24.5 billion. On a comp basis, a reported 3, which again, excluding gas deflation and FX, was a 5 on a normalized basis. In terms of the 3% reported comp, that was a combination of an average transaction decrease of 2%, actually up almost 1% excluding deflation and FX, and an average frequency increase of just under 4.5% for the quarter. In terms of sales comparisons geographically, for the first quarter, the better performing regions in the U.S. were in the Southeast, Midwest, and Texas. Internationally, in local currencies, the better performing countries were Canada, Mexico, and Australia. In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, for the first quarter, within food and sundries, candy, deli, and refrigerated were the relative standouts. Hardlines was probably the most challenging category. Majors came in negative for the quarter, challenging of course in televisions and in cameras. And better-performing departments within the hardlines were office and automotive, but slightly negative overall for the department. Within the low double digit softlines positive comps, small electrics, apparel, and jewelry were the relative standouts. And within fresh foods, comps in the mid singles. Better performing departments included produce, meat, and deli. Moving down the line items of the income statement, in the first quarter, membership fee income came in at $549 million or 2.24% of sales. That\u2019s 7.3% or a $38 million increase versus the first quarter of last year, and as a percentage of sales, up 4 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, that did include the extra $8 million, the first time that incremental benefit from the fee increase we did almost two years ago.  In terms of membership, we continue to benefit from strong renewal rates. A little over 90% in Canada and the U.S., and just under 87% worldwide, continued increased penetration of the executive members, and of course the benefit I just mentioned, from the fee increase. Our new membership signups in the first quarter companywide were up 17%. That\u2019s of course due to the fact that we opened 13 units this year in the first quarter versus 9 a year ago, and this year\u2019s first quarter included three international openings, which tend to have higher signups at opening. In terms of number of members at Q1 end, Gold Star members came in at the end of the first quarter at 29.6 million, up from 28.9 million 12 weeks earlier, at the end of the fiscal year; Primary Business at 6.7 million, up from 6.6 million 12 weeks ago; Business Add On at 3.5 million each.  So, total total member households, which, at the end of the fiscal year had been at 39 million even, came in at the end of the first quarter at 39.8 million. So, all told, we have 72.5 million card holders out there at the end of the first quarter, from 71.2 million at fiscal year-end. In terms of paid Executive members, they stood at 13.9 million of those totals, an increase of about 330,000 during the quarter, or a little over 27,000 new Executive members per week increase. They represent about 35% of our member base now, and over two-thirds of our sales. In terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned, they\u2019ve continued to be strong. Our total membership eked up a little bit from 90.0 at the end of fiscal year to 90.2 worldwide, and worldwide from an 86.3 to an 86.5. Going down the gross margin line, our reported gross margins were up 13 basis points, up to 10.81%. As usual, I\u2019ll ask you to jot down four columns and six line items. Basically, the first two columns would be reported for the entire fiscal year of \u201913, and then the second column would be also for the entire year fiscal \u201913, but without gas. And then for the first quarter, columns three and four would be reported and then without gas deflation. Going down the lines, the core merchandise year over year, ancillary businesses, 2% Reward, LIFO, other, and total. So again, going across, core merchandising for the fiscal year, fiscal \u201913 versus fiscal \u201912 was lower by 4 basis points in both of those columns. Ancillary businesses was better in the fiscal \u201913, plus 6, in both of those columns. 2% Reward, minus 2 in both columns. LIFO, plus 5 basis points in both columns. Other, plus 2 in both columns. That was a nonrecurring legal settlement, which benefited our margins last year. And the total fiscal \u201913 over fiscal \u201912 was up 7 basis points, both on a reported basis and without gas. For the first quarter, merchandise core reported was up 12, but without gas deflation up 3. Ancillary, up 5, but without gas, plus 2. 2% Reward, minus 3 and minus 2. LIFO, minus 1 and minus 1. Other, zero and zero. So again, total reported for the first quarter year over year and the first quarter was 13 basis points up, but taking out gas, deflation was up 2 basis points. Now, the core margin, in terms of core merchandising the component gross margin being up again 12, but 3 excluding gas. Both food and sundries and hardline subcategories were up in basis points year over year, while softlines was down slightly year over year and fresh foods had lower year over year gross margins as well. Ancillary business gross margins were up, as I mentioned, 2 basis points without gas. Ecommerce, business centers, and pharmacy also showed higher margins year over year, offsetting slightly lower gas margins.  Our 2% Reward, again increasing sales penetration in that, and therefore increasing Executive member rewards, caused a 2 basis point year over year reduction in margin, due to the reward program. And LIFO, last year in the quarter we had a $2 million LIFO credit. This year, there was a very small LIFO charge of about $1 million, so about a 1 basis point swing year over year.  Moving on to SG&A, our SG&A percentage in the first quarter was higher or worse by 17 basis points, coming in at 10.22% this year in the first quarter, compared to 10.05% last year in the first quarter. Again, we\u2019ll do the same four columns, reported for all of fiscal \u201913 and then without gas, and then columns three and four reported for the first quarter year over year and then without gas for the first quarter year over year.  In terms of operations, in the fiscal year both columns are the same, columns one and two, zero and zero for operations; central, zero and zero; RSUs, or stock compensation, minus 3 and minus 3; quarterly adjustment, plus 2 and plus 2, for a total in fiscal \u201913 SG&A was higher by 1 basis point or minus 1 year over year. Columns three and four, operations on a reported basis was 9 basis points of that 17, minus 9. Without gas, zero. Central, minus 3 and minus 2. Stock or RSU compensation, minus 5 and minus 5. No quarterly adjustments. And then again total minus 17 or 17 basis points higher year over year in the first quarter. And again, without gas, minus 7. Now, core operations, again, was flat, excluding the impact of gas deflation. Within operations, our payroll SG&A percentage was actually 2 basis points better year over year, while benefits, workers comp, and related expenses were about 4 basis points worse year over year. So those are the two big factors within SG&A [unintelligible]. Central expense was higher year over year, 2 basis points without gas, again primarily related to the increased IT spending as we continue our modernization efforts. This, as I said, will continue to be a drag on SG&A, especially as the new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. And finally, SG&A expense related to stock compensation, as I mentioned earlier, I won\u2019t go through the detail again, was 5 basis points year over year. In terms of preopening, $6 million higher, coming in at $24 million in the first quarter. Last year, in the first quarter, we had nine openings. As I mentioned, we had 13 opening this year, so no real surprises there. All told, reported operating income in the first quarter totaled $639 million last year and was up to $668 million this year, an increase of $29 million. And I won\u2019t go through the items I mentioned earlier. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was higher versus last year, coming in at $27 million, up $14 million from last year\u2019s $13 million in the quarter. That\u2019s essentially the $3.5 billion debt offering we did and the interest expense associated with that. We did that, I believe, in mid-December, so there will be a little bit of a year over year negative impact in Q2, and then there will be no delta year over year. Interest income and other was lower by $2 million in the quarter, coming in last year at $20 million, and this year at $18 million. Actual interest income component was slightly up, while the other component was slightly down, nothing of size to mention. Overall, pretax income was up from $646 million last year in the first quarter to $659 this year. Below pretax, our effective tax rate this quarter came in at 34.6%, or about 0.2% better or lower than last year\u2019s rate of 34.8%. I think most of it relates to the various discrete items that impact each year, and so a little bit of an improvement there. Overall, net income was up $416 million last year to $425 million this year in the first quarter. Quick rundown of other topics. Our balance sheet, of course, is included in today\u2019s press release. In terms of depreciation and amortization for the first quarter, it was $231 million. One of the metrics we always talk about is our accounts payable as a percent of inventory. On a reported basis, last year it was 108%. This year, in the first quarter, it was 99%.  Now, both of those numbers include quite a bit of non-merchandise payables, particularly as we ramp up expansion, so construction payables, if you will. If you just look at merchandise accounts payable to inventories, last year\u2019s 108 was a 94, and this year\u2019s 99 was an 89. I\u2019ll talk about that in a moment, why that came down a little. Average inventory per warehouse last year in the first quarter was $13.2 million. This year, in the first quarter, it was up $1.2 million to $14.5 million, or up about 9%. Both of those AP ratios and the higher inventories is, for the most part, because of how Thanksgiving fell one week later in the calendar this year. So the first week of Q2 versus last year it was the last week of Q1. Much of that excess has since been burned off, and talking to the senior merchants, their view is no issues with inventory levels going into the last few weeks, before calendar year end. In terms of capex, for the quarter it was $572 million. Capex is estimated to be about $2.4 billion this year, compared to $2.1 billion last year, the higher year over year spend, of course, due to the increased level of planned openings.  In terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend remained at $0.31 a share or $1.24 on an annualized basis. Based on shares outstanding, that\u2019s about a $540 million annual expenditure. Costco Online, we\u2019re now in four countries, U.S., Canada, U.K., and most recently Mexico. Mexico ecommerce commenced operations in late October. For the first quarter, sales and profits were up over last year. Q1 ecommerce sales were up 24%. And excluding, again, the relative recent smaller startups in the U.K. and Mexico, U.S. and Canada, the quarter was up 22%. And ecommerce still is a relatively small part of our company, running about 2.5% of our total sales. We\u2019ve got a variety of initiatives in that area. We\u2019re always asked those questions, so I\u2019ll point out a couple of things. Of course, a year and a half ago, we replatformed the site, and shortly thereafter, added mobile apps.  We\u2019ve combined, in the last year, some ecommerce merchandising efforts, within line efforts. We think that\u2019s given us a better merchandise capability there. We\u2019ve added a few categories, most particularly apparel, some apparel items. And we\u2019ve done, I think, a better job of improving the timing of shipments by expanding the various shipping points, getting merchandise more quickly to our members. In terms of expansion, last year we opened 26 units and started fiscal \u201913 a quarter ago at 608 units and ended at 634. So it was up a lot of 4% square footage growth. This year, assuming we get to the 30 net units, on a base of 634 that would round up to about 5% square footage growth. Now, again, if we get to 30, and we expect to, 16 in the U.S., 4 in Australia, 3 in Canada, 2 each in Korea, Japan, and Spain, and one in Mexico. Square footage at Q1 end totaled 92,654,000 square feet. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for Q&A, and I\u2019ll put myself on speaker phone here. Operator : [Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : On gross margin by category, can you give a little color? Two were up, two were down. I know mix might be some of the explanation, say hardline\u2019s up maybe because majors and TVs down. But a little more color on that, and are there clear areas where you\u2019re making some price investments in that grouping of four? Richard Galanti : Clearly fresh foods is the one I\u2019ve talked about in the past. Fresh food margins year over year in the quarter were down. Frankly, they were down, I think, less. In Q4 it was a bigger down year over year. There are a lot of moving parts, of course, but when I go to the budget meeting each month and hear the merchants talk, certainly fresh foods is an important part. As we go into the seasonal period of September through December, you\u2019re trying to do some hot prices on exciting nonfood items as well, bigger ticket items. TVs, in my view, has a little bit more to do with SG&A. When you sell a few less thousand dollar price point items, that probably impacts your SG&A a little bit. But I don\u2019t even know how much it moves the needle. It helps, but it\u2019s one of many things. So we keep doing what we\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any big surprises to us in these numbers. If anything, one of the things I mentioned last quarter, when I pointed out fresh foods were, I think, 80 or so basis points lower year over year, and it\u2019s quite a bit less than that delta in the first quarter, part of that was, as we\u2019d maintained some key prices on some very high volume key items like the rotisserie chickens, as some of the underlying costs come down a little from their peak, that helps margin a little bit.  So I think we haven\u2019t changed what we do necessarily to try to reduce that delta or prove a positive delta, it\u2019s just where it came out. We\u2019re ever diligent in being competitive out there. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : Do you think longer term, over a five to ten year time horizon, that as Kirkland penetration goes up, do you think that gives you much room to get sharper on branded pricing? Or not really excited about, that\u2019s an independent decision? Richard Galanti : Honestly, there\u2019s a hundred different independent decisions. That\u2019s part of it, certainly. When we expand Kirkland Signature, it does a lot of things. In many cases, as you suggested, we can get a little bit more margin and provide even greater value to our member.  As important, in some cases it drives a lower price on the branded item as the branded item loses market share to the private label, which again serves us and our member well. So overall, on an overall basis, probably increasing penetration of KS helps you. I think increasing penetration of our total sales in locations that don\u2019t have a direct warehouse club competitor helps you a little bit in some of these other countries. As you can see from our segment analysis, certainly it would imply that in Canada, which again has been a very strong economy and good growth for us locally as well, not having a direct warehouse club probably works a little higher margin. Not a lot. I mean, we don\u2019t take great advantage of that. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : And in terms of expansion, I know every country will have different levels of capacity peoplewise, but when you sort of aggregate it, is there a level - you know, as you do 30 this year, maybe a couple more next year - is there a level where you simply, for people reasons, cannot go beyond that without fearing execution might slip? Richard Galanti : For us, long term is two or three years sometimes. I think five years ago, when we were averaging something in the low 20s, our goal was to see, you know, can we get it up to 30. And we feel pretty comfortable, as I indicated in the last few calls, that both this year and over the next three or four years some number in the low to mid 30s we feel pretty good about, hopefully starting at 30 and ending at 35 in a few years. Beyond that, one would think that we could expand that a little bit if the opportunities still present themselves out there. I don\u2019t think that will be a people issue. We\u2019ve done, as you know, a lot of ramp up in several countries. We\u2019ve gone from 8 to 18, or 9 to 18 units in Japan in the last couple of years. We\u2019re going to go from 3 to 7 or 8 in Australia this year. And we\u2019re adding as fast as we can, it\u2019s harder to do in Taiwan and Korea getting sites, but we\u2019ve got the pipeline full, so hopefully we\u2019ll get a little more there. And so that strains you a little bit, because you don\u2019t want to move some of those people. If anything, we\u2019ve devoted more people to those areas. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a constraint. I mean, if we did 25 a year four or five years ago, and we\u2019re doing 30-ish plus a year now, and five years from now certainly something north of that, assuming the opportunities out there present themselves is certainly a likelihood. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank : If we kind of strip out the impact of gas, could you just speak more to operating margin performance this quarter in the various segments between U.S. versus Canada and international? Richard Galanti : I think the detail will be in the Q. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any big trend changes from most recent year and quarters. In terms of operating profitability as a percentage of sales, Canada is stronger than the U.S. It has had a great economy, it\u2019s been a great business for us. It has no direct warehouse operator. Its healthcare costs, on average, are a little lower. So all those things worked in our favor. The other column, it generally is more profitable, but again we\u2019re opening a lot of new units, and we\u2019re cannibalizing. Going into Spain, we\u2019ll certainly have not only a little extra preopening, but once we get open, $0.5 a million or $1 million a month just in central over there, with one partial unit for a few months. So I think those things tend to make that column a little harder to understand, and generally speaking, many of those countries in that other column tend to be higher pretax percent of sales than the U.S. Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank : And then just moving to the U.S., can you just give us an update on the top line trends that you\u2019re seeing in California? Richard Galanti : No big differences. The big differences in California were way back when the economy first got hit. Not only California, but Arizona, Las Vegas, and Florida, if I recall correctly. Those were the ones that were hit hardest. I think California overall is probably a shade lower than the rest of the U.S. But the rest of the U.S. includes, you know, Midwest, Texas, where we\u2019re opening new units, and we\u2019ve been pretty successful in seeing more robust top line sales growth. Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank : And just my last question, can you just remind us and give us, on the expense side, how should we think about some of these investments that you\u2019re making and the impact over the next few quarters? Richard Galanti : The one that I pointed out now, for probably the last five fiscal quarters, all the quarters last year plus this first quarter, is IT modernization. We have finally had the courage, I think, a few years ago, to recognize that we had great home-grown systems that were kept together and allowed us to do what we wanted to do, but as we\u2019re becoming more global, and bigger, and getting to a platform and a whole IT infrastructure, that will serve us as we go from hopefully $100 billion to $200 billion in the next many years.  That\u2019s several hundreds of millions of dollars over three or four years. We\u2019re halfway into it, maybe a little under halfway into it, and so my guess is I\u2019ll be talking to you about a few basis points each quarter year over year and incrementally probably into \u201915, before it starts flattening out and coming down. But not only is a lot of that expenditure necessary, there\u2019s dividends, we believe, that will come from it too. In a way, one of the first modernization things we did, even before we called it modernization, was replatforming dotcom a year and a half ago. Again, we had a website, the search engines couldn\u2019t even crawl on it, to give you a simple example. We see the potential there. Still relatively small business to our company, but a very profitable business, so we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity as we replatform and we rewrite the membership system, the basic buying systems, the [unintelligible] systems. But it\u2019s necessary as well.  Beyond that, it doesn\u2019t seem like healthcare costs are going to change dramatically in the U.S. As a higher percentage of our total company is from overseas, outside the U.S., for the most part every other country that we operate in, the healthcare related costs are lower as a percentage of sales. I might be wrong on one country, but for the most part that\u2019s correct. So those are the kinds of things that, again, there\u2019s probably a few structural things that, as non-U.S. sales become a higher percentage of the total company, whether it\u2019s a lack of direct warehouse competition in many of these countries, whether it\u2019s lower healthcare costs as a percentage of sales, in some cases a little higher membership fee percentages as a percentage of sales, maybe in some cases occupancy as a percentage of sales is a little higher, but more than offset by the other things I mentioned. So generally speaking, I think that will tend to help us a little bit, and I try to point that out as we go along here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays. Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital : You\u2019re talking about international, and you\u2019re going to be opening up a couple of clubs in Spain. Can you talk a little bit about what your strategy is about Europe, and the reason for Spain, and not for France or Italy? Just wondering how you think about that. Richard Galanti : We\u2019ve talked about Spain and France with Spain coming first and France hopefully the following year. So we have a few people on the ground in France, or less than a few. But we\u2019re working towards that. And you know, when we looked at where are we going to go before we decided on those two, there\u2019s various different parts of the world, we felt that we\u2019ve had a place of operations in the U.K. for many years, under a little different format, in terms of how we market to our Gold Star members in the U.K. But we always looked at Western Europe as a good opportunity for us. Frankly, the economies over there we feel have allowed us the opportunity to get in and to be welcome. We provide good, high-paying jobs, we\u2019re great competitors, and frankly we see the economy a little better than some of the numbers you just read about unemployment. So we think it was an opportunity for us to get in when historically it was a little harder, and we\u2019ll see where we go from there. But to start with, it will be Spain first, France second, and then we\u2019ll let you know when we do. Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital : And is it fair to say that you are looking at places where people are looking for those unique values? So Germany, where the economy has been stronger, they would be something that would come lower on the list of priorities? Richard Galanti : Well, we do better in stronger economies, frankly. I think each country has its own set of challenges compared to the United States. And again, I\u2019m not prepared to talk a lot about some of those other countries at this point, since we\u2019re focused right now on really ramping up the newer countries, like Asia and Australia, as well as what we\u2019re doing in these new two countries over in Europe. Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital : And then I have a question about ecommerce. First, I was just wondering, I\u2019m sure you do talk to your members, what kind of feedback do you get from them about how much they want ecommerce to be part of what they get from Costco? And is it discussions with them that have a big influence on what you actually sell online? Or are you trying to test new things or sort of branch out in any way through ecommerce? Richard Galanti : We take member comments all the time, both online and in warehouse. Ecommerce is certainly an important component of what\u2019s out there, what\u2019s growing. We recognize we\u2019re a retail competitor. It\u2019s part of the landscape. We\u2019re very much a brick and mortar. You know, 97% plus of our business is in store, not online. What we have done is we looked at it as not trying to offer a million different items for our members. Arguably, we don\u2019t offer a million different items to them in store. We offer less than 4,000.  And we view it as an extension of that, in some categories, as well as some overlap. We\u2019ve been successful in bigger ticket items, hard to handle items like furniture and televisions. But I think the example I mentioned earlier about apparel, we tried some apparel items several years ago in online, and underwhelmed us and our members. We\u2019re trying some different things now, and it seems to be working.  But again, ecommerce is a small percent, and a given department like that is a small percent. But we are getting some traction. We want our members to buy everything at Costco, whether it\u2019s in-store or online, and we\u2019ll keep trying some new things. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani from ISI Group. Michael Montani - ISI Group : Wanted to ask about inflation. It looks like maybe with gasoline in total it could have been slightly down for this quarter. Is that right? And also, what are your buyers seeing out there six, nine months out? Richard Galanti : Again, we had a very small LIFO charge. Given the volatility in gas, it was deflationary, although I don\u2019t think we took any of that in the first quarter. We tend to wait into the year. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done over the past many years. So probably, including gas, yes, it was slightly deflationary, but not reflected in our small LIFO charge. In terms of outlook, the only thing that I can recall from the budget meetings has to do with some fresh food items or commodities. You know, three months ago, the outlook was three to six months hence, so that would now be three months. Generally speaking, I think that\u2019s still the case, with the exception of some produce items which are more a function of what\u2019s going on with weather in different places. I know there\u2019s been shortages in berries and each of these items are big volumes for us, and that drives the price and availability of these things up. But overall, I haven\u2019t heard about, from the general nonfood areas, anything big. If I look at the last month, just strolling down the 30 biggest inflationary items, there\u2019s a few on the beef side, there\u2019s several produce, like strawberries is up 25% plus, blueberries up more than that on a cost basis. Then I look on the deflationary side, you have the usual suspects of electronics and gas, of course, as I mentioned earlier. And a few other items that generally are some commodity items that peaked a year ago and come down some. So again, no big inflation raiser this time. Michael Montani - ISI Group : And just a quick follow up on Kirkland. Can you just remind us where the penetration is today, and is it still kind of 50-75 type penetration increases that you\u2019re seeing? Richard Galanti : It\u2019s in the 23 plus range. My guess is it\u2019s half a percent. Part of that is that as we roll out gas in Canada, aside from gas deflation right now, as gas from the company has gone from 9 to 10 to 11 to 12 percent, everything else, KS, is increasing relative to that other 87 or 88 percent. Michael Montani - ISI Group : And then just an ecommerce question, actually, that has somewhat of two parts. If you bear with me, the first part is can you just talk about some of the efforts that you have to sort of integrate your work online with the in store experience, and how there\u2019s interplay there? And then the second one is the AP to inventory ration this quarter obviously came down a little bit. When we look at one of your larger competitors in Amazon, it\u2019s north of 200. So I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s opportunity for initiatives there to really increase that, and if we\u2019ll hear about you guys cohabitating, so to speak, on warehouses with some vendors or anything like that. Richard Galanti : First of all, as it relates to Amazon\u2019s enviable 200 basis point, I think a lot of that, as I understand it, for every dollar of reported sales they\u2019ve got close to $0.50 of other throughput, which is not a sale. It doesn\u2019t report on their GAAP income statement, because they\u2019re handling merchandise for others, where they charge service fees for doing that. In many instances, when that merchandise is sold, it\u2019s sold through Amazon and Amazon gets the money and doesn\u2019t pay those third-party sellers, if you will, until after. And so my understanding is, and I could be wrong, a big chunk of it is that. I would assume, as they handle more inventory that are their sales, that will pressure that number a little bit, but that\u2019s a very enviable number to have. In our case, on the other hand, we\u2019ve always kind of looked and said, how can we get to 100%? Can we get no cash required for our inventories? It\u2019s going to fluctuate. This one downturn here has more to do with Thanksgiving than anything. That one week, burning a couple of extra days of sales or incremental equivalents of a day of sales, we get that back in order pretty quickly. I think that as we\u2019re ramping up expansion, that will tend to reduce the number a little bit. But we\u2019ve always been in the high 80s to very low 100s, depending on which fiscal quarter and timing it is. And I don\u2019t see a lot of change there. Ultimately, if we can turn our inventory faster, it\u2019s going to help that. Gas has helped it in a perverse way. We turn our gas many times a week, many, many times a year. So we\u2019ve got a lot of payables there relative to inventory. So I think that it\u2019s going to fluctuate a little bit. The only think I wanted to point out in this quarter was Thanksgiving had more to do with the reduction there. I think our inventory turns, our goal is to continue to turn it faster. Ecommerce turns it faster for sure for us, but it\u2019s 2.5% of our business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : We were hoping you could comment on the buybacks. Specifically, did you guys do any this quarter? And if so, how many shares did you repurchase? Richard Galanti : We did not do any this quarter, but stay tuned. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : And then just a clarifying item on the stock expense. I guess you mentioned that some of the increase year on year was related to, basically, it was more [tenure]. Is that a trend that continues here going forward? And would you expect additional pressure on that line because of it? Richard Galanti : That will continue to have some pressure, recognizing every time a given person hits 25, 30, or in a very few examples 35, that\u2019s going to hit it, although that reduces that amount because it\u2019s the same charge over five years, it just comes sooner. And so it will be bumpy sometimes. When I looked at the four quarters this coming fiscal year, the big hit is in Q1. It dips a little bit in Q2. It dips back up in Q3, and dips a lot in Q4, relative to the increase we saw in Q1. Some of that has to do with the timing of acceleration. In addition, we\u2019ve always put a lot of compensation focus in most of those people\u2019s cases, or in many of the managers and above, if you will, over half of their annual compensation relates to stock, and hopefully stock price performance. But we\u2019ve tended to try to keep the number of grants each year to a given person at a given responsibility level the same. This is the first time in many years that we\u2019ve reduced it, recognizing the stock has been very strong, not only this year but several years.  Now, again, by reducing the grant by an average of around 15% per recipient - and it ranged from zero for lower grants to 20% for our CEO and chairman and board - that will continue to impact us for a few years year, but I think this was a little bit more of an anomaly this quarter and it will be an anomaly in the third quarter and sometimes there will be a little less. But overall, I think it will be a slight increase of the SG&A in each of the next couple of years. Now, one thing that will reduce it if the stock, next October, is at a price lower than the $117 or $118, but we hope that goes the other way and it\u2019s a little higher expense, so we\u2019ll see. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise from UBS. Jason DeRise - UBS : I always get a lot of questions about why you do so well internationally. And so I was wondering if we could get some color on a few specific markets, particularly in Canada and Mexico. And I guess I\u2019m talking about just top line success, and if you can comment at all about how you\u2019re doing with members there? Richard Galanti : Canada, first of all, has had a great local economy. It didn\u2019t get hit with the financial crisis that we in the U.S. did. Some of its economy is natural resource based, which has been on a boom for the last couple of years. Jason DeRise - UBS : But there\u2019s more competition in Canada too, and when I look at some of your competitors there, it doesn\u2019t sound so rosy, so it\u2019s got to be something else. Richard Galanti : Well, there\u2019s no direct competition, there\u2019s no other warehouse club operator. Mind you, our warehouse club business is roughly at 11% gross margin. Other forms of big box discount ranges everywhere from the very high teens to, in the case of home improvement, to the low to mid 30s. But call it the high teens and low 20s for general merchandise big box discount. And supermarkets, of course, are in the mid-20s and up. So at 10 or 11, that\u2019s a pretty compelling value proposition, when you don\u2019t have another warehouse operator. So I think that helps us a little bit. We don\u2019t take a lot of advantage of that. We have a little extra margins. In some countries, while our labor cost in every country we view our labor wage rates are at a significant premium to comparable big box hourly retail, they frankly are lower in terms of dollars in some countries. And sometimes the top line purchasing power is not as low. So that helps your percentages there. And some countries, like Asia, we have a lot more members per warehouse when we start up, so we have a little higher percentage of membership fees as a percentage of sales. Again, on a macro basis, the one thing internationally in some of these countries that stands out a little higher might be occupancy, but we own 80% of our units, so you don\u2019t see that in SG&A, frankly, a lot. You see a little more depreciation perhaps, but you don\u2019t see rent charges. And so all those things have tended to help, but by and large, in my view the big factor is going to be no direct warehouse competitor. Jason DeRise - UBS : And then in Mexico, I guess that\u2019s one that\u2019s every monthly sales call it\u2019s been called out as one of the strengths, and we haven\u2019t seen that many openings from you. You do have a direct competitor there, so maybe talk about what\u2019s working in Mexico. Richard Galanti : Well, it\u2019s working very well for us. We have, I think, 33 or 34 units. Sam\u2019s has over 100. They have been much more aggressive over the years. We know saleswise that our units, like the U.S., do more volume per warehouse.  Until July of 2012, we owned 50% of a venture, and operated it, with a very good partner, Comercial Mexicana, down there. They had some financial issues, and so for I think five years, leading up to July 12, over five years we opened a total of two units down there. We have ramped up our activities and efforts down there. We opened, I think, one this year, but we\u2019ve got plans for more.  And you\u2019ll see that come up a little bit. We\u2019re not going to go crazy. We\u2019re not going to go from 30 to 40 in a year, but you\u2019ll see that 0.4 number, if you will, two units over five years, increase quite a bit and continue in that direction. Jason DeRise - UBS : And just one more question about some of the new markets. As you thought about Australia, and I guess now Spain, do you think it\u2019s more like a Canadian market, where if you keep your margin structure, in terms of your markups, the same as the U.S. or any other market you compete in, that you think you just come in at a wider gap, and that\u2019s why you picked it, those markets, as the next of the evolution? Or is there something else about where you can source product that you\u2019re bringing back to the U.S.? I guess there\u2019s some less known synergy about shipping to Asia crates of American product and bringing product back that you\u2019re selling in the U.S. Richard Galanti : I like to think we\u2019re that smart sometimes. But again, we look at all countries around the world, and where we\u2019re going to go. Australia we viewed, much like we did Alaska and Hawaii 25 years ago, where the margins, and the markups, in those two states were dramatically different than the mainland. And Australia also has a very high price structure.  As I understand, two retail competitors have upwards of two-thirds of the market share over there. So we came in with our margins, which were even more dramatic over there. But we also look at it as what is the potential.  Part of our due diligence, if you will, in addition to looking at various metrics like population and small business and average household income, is really shopping the towns, and going over and visiting these places, you know, feet on the ground, all the way from our chairman and CEO to key merchants and operators, and see how vibrant the retail business, and how competitive it is. We think that as we\u2019ve gone into these countries, clearly we are the extreme value proposition in terms of markup.  Again, when we look at Spain, we think the economy is a little better than some of the numbers would portray in terms of unemployment. But we\u2019re there for the long term also, and the economy should get better over time. But it\u2019s less to do with what products come from there.  Part of our success, as an example, in Asia and these other countries, is bringing not only Kirkland Signature items but in some cases U.S. sourced goods that aren\u2019t there. And we all think of ourselves sometimes as liking things like Italian leather and cashmere from Europe, and guess what, some of these other countries like big American stuff at great value and prices. So that\u2019s helped us as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research : I\u2019d like to focus on the second quarter to date, and how has the sales cadence been trending by week, and how do you feel about the mix thus far as the second quarter has progressed towards Christmas? Richard Galanti : Of course, we don\u2019t provide any guidance. Nice try. The only thing we did say, certainly for everybody, not just us, in the U.S., the switch of Thanksgiving a week later certainly impacted November reported sales and the November-ish month of our first quarter. The fact that there\u2019s five less days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, less selling days, that\u2019s certainly going to be an impact for everybody out there. But you know, we plan for it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research : Just following up on Chuck\u2019s question, and kind of getting your take on the sales climate, aside from the one less week that you talked about, a number of companies have seen their sales slow post-Labor Day, and you guys have been somewhat immune to the slowdown, although that did change a little in November. Was that due in part to the one less week, as you just mentioned, or is there anything else going on that you could comment on? Richard Galanti : There\u2019s not a whole lot we see. Not really. We\u2019ve commented on the slower TV sales. It was very strong a year ago. I think there\u2019s a little less promotion out there. But there\u2019s really not a whole lot beyond that. Frequency continues to be strong. Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research : And then just following up on that, it sounded like last quarter, if my memory serves correctly, that you\u2019d be willing to keep some margin if prices fell more quickly, as you maintain your competitive pricing in areas such as food. Has anything changed in the competitive landscape over the last couple of months, or what you see over the next few months that could mitigate your ability to capture some of that margin if it\u2019s available? Richard Galanti : First of all, separate sales and margin. We don\u2019t really see a whole lot of change in the landscape, other than a few retailers opened earlier into Thanksgiving this year. We don\u2019t really see a whole lot out there different. There\u2019s certainly more promotional stuff that we all read about each day that some of the power retailers are doing, and [onto the] merchants. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom from Sterne Agee. Charles Grom - Sterne Agee : Just a quick follow up on an earlier question. You guys mentioned no buybacks in the quarter, and haven\u2019t had any since Q1 \u201913 it looks like. Could you just maybe talk a little bit about the strategy to return cash to shareholders with regard to the various vehicles that are available to you, whether it be another special dividend or increasing the ongoing dividend, or starting to buy back more shares aggressively going forward? Richard Galanti : Well, again, it\u2019s more art form than science here. We still view our outlook and our opportunities going forward positively. First and foremost is to ramp up expansion, which we have done, although we\u2019re generating more cash than that. We have historically, for now eight or nine years, raised our dividend every spring, I believe. We of course did a big special cash dividend, a little over $3 billion, last December. : Charles Grom - Sterne Agee : And then just wondering if you could perhaps provide some perspective on the U.S. consumer right now. The general retail environment seems to be more promotional this holiday season, while your approach has always kind of been more in terms of offering everyday value. So I\u2019m just wondering what you\u2019re seeing out of the consumer in terms of his or her appetite for even more competitive pricing, and do you think the generally more promotional environment is affecting your business at all materially? Richard Galanti : We do not think it\u2019s affecting us materially. I mean, the fact is that when there\u2019s a lot of promotions, they work. If some traditional merchants are backed up in inventory, they\u2019re going to be very much more promotional. I think as evidenced by our frequency, we still have them coming in, and we have them coming in a surprisingly continued increase year over year.  Now, that being said, if they stopped at these promotions first, that\u2019s one less thing they may buy at Costco. But we feel very good about our merchandising and our own merchandise marketing activities as it relates to the MBM, some hot buys. We think that we\u2019ve got a lot of good things going on. Again, in talking to the senior merchants, we feel quite good about coming out of the season with nothing unusual in terms of markdowns and having clean inventory. So I think that\u2019s, in my view, good evidence that we\u2019re not seeing a big impact out there. Charles Grom - Sterne Agee : And then just one more, if I may. Can you provide an update, and maybe some flavor, on the progress of some of your newer merchandising initiatives, whether it be in organics or upscaling of fresh foods and cosmetics, or improved assortment in apparel? Any color there would be appreciated. Richard Galanti : I think you mentioned two or three of the ones that would be at the top of the list. Certainly we\u2019ve talked about apparel now for a year, year and a half, and having still double digit increases year over year, two years out. Part of that is our own commitment to expanded apparel. Part of that is from brands. Part of that is the Kirkland Signature. We\u2019ve got a great Italian wool men\u2019s pant that\u2019s $49, actually $39 right now, and we\u2019ve gone from 100,000 to 1 million pair in the last few years. We\u2019re massing that up better.  Cosmetics, we\u2019ve got a couple of units in the L.A. market where we\u2019re testing some expanded cosmetics. We still would like to get more brands to sell us, but we\u2019re pretty scrappy, we\u2019re getting a few things in ourselves. But it\u2019s still a small business for us. The ticket programs, whether it\u2019s for movies or for ski vacations or local restaurants, those continue to grow. So again, probably one good thing over the last year or so is some of these nonfood categories, from apparel to domestics to housewares. Those have had some good legs for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Exstein from Credit Suisse. Michael Exstein - Credit Suisse : Thank you for the update on ecommerce. Could we sort of shift to another part of ecommerce? Amazon announced today that they\u2019re going to start home delivery of grocery in the Bay Area. Where are you in sort of thinking about what you do with the grocery business as new threats come into it, and how do you look at that new form of competition? Richard Galanti : We\u2019ll keep looking at it. We have no plans currently to deliver to homes anything other than through ecommerce, which tends to be nonfood items, and very limited foodstuffs, and surely not fresh foods. We enjoy watching the landscape as others are getting into those types of businesses. Some of the supermarket chains, Walmart.  You know, Google is doing something in the Bay Area as a test with a number of brick and mortar retailers, including us, where they\u2019ll deliver through the Google Mall. They come in and buy it. We do some help in store at just a couple of locations, as a test, but it\u2019s small, and it\u2019s a test.  So I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of changes over time. You know, getting overnight delivery or same-day delivery is great, but ultimately you\u2019ve got to pay for it, and we\u2019ll see. I think there\u2019s probably a market for it, but we\u2019ll see how big that market is. We keep doing what we\u2019re doing in terms of value. If things change dramatically out there, we\u2019ll figure it out, but there\u2019s a long way to go there first. Michael Exstein - Credit Suisse : Has your business in grocery in Seattle, where Amazon has been most established, been any different overall than elsewhere in the country? Richard Galanti : No. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict of Robert Baird. Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird : Just wanted to follow up on Michael\u2019s question there, on the online business. Clearly you guys have a lot of good momentum here. In terms of just fulfillment as it relates to online orders, it sounds like you guys aren\u2019t interested in delivering to homes. But just curious where you stand in terms of developing capabilities such as buy online, pick up in store. Is that something we should expect within the next few years? Or are these types of flexibility fulfillment capabilities just not really important to your core customer? Richard Galanti : Well, a lot of what online is is delivering to home, but it\u2019s delivering televisions and swing sets and furniture and some apparel, again, a very limited amount of shelf stable, if you will, food items. And then we also do office products and things online to small business.  But you know, look, 97.5% of our business is in store. It\u2019s continuing to grow nicely. People actually do like to go out and shop. And when I\u2019ve been asked the question before, on Amazon Fresh, up here in Seattle, or some other type of fresh delivery in other parts of the country, in New York, what have you, my sense is that probably that\u2019s taking some market share more from what are the other daily or every other day alternatives when you\u2019re stopping at the supermarket two and a half, three times a week? Again, on an incremental basis, is there something you\u2019re going to get that way that you didn\u2019t get at Costco?  But if we can keep you coming in, you\u2019re still getting a lot of key bulk items at our place on the fresh food side as well. And our most loyal members are still getting some of those things at supermarkets and other forms of convenience. And Amazon will be just one of those, or other forms of overnight or other delivery.  You know, it\u2019s different value. Again, we recognize convenience is a value. I think both Amazon and some of these others out there, the quality tends to be good, the availability sometimes is good or not, but you\u2019re paying for that convenience, and there\u2019s a lot of things that people are still going to buy at our place, and if we can keep you coming in, then we\u2019ll get our share of that. Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird : And just a question on traffic. I think you said up 4.5% in the quarter. It\u2019s been pretty consistently healthy. Is there any material difference you guys are seeing between U.S. frequency versus the trend internationally? Richard Galanti : It\u2019s pretty much the same. It\u2019s a little higher in new markets. If you asked me what\u2019s the most surprising, it\u2019s that the U.S. is pretty darn close to the rest of the world. Canada is a little higher than that, and again, as evidenced by a local currency comp in the mid to high singles. And by the way, some of the frequency numbers change. Like, as we cannibalize, as we go in two years from roughly 9 to 18 units in Japan and add 2 or 3 more units in Tokyo, that\u2019s going to cannibalize and reduce the frequency of that existing unit. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James and Associates. Budd Bugatch - Raymond James : My questions kind of go back to international, and I\u2019m curious if you could shed some light on what other countries similar to Spain exhibit attractive characteristics that you may look to get into in the future? Richard Galanti : It will be a while, and if I knew, I wouldn\u2019t tell you. [laughter] Budd Bugatch - Raymond James : So moving on to my follow up, where do you see the international business going as a percentage of total sales eventually, and the exposure to currency fluctuations as a result? Richard Galanti : Well, I think it\u2019s going to continue to increase. Five years ago, 80% of our unit openings were in the U.S., or 75%. This year 50-55% will be U.S. Over the next three or four years, probably a shade under 50, maybe 40-45% perhaps. So I think over time it will continue to increase.  I think the U.S. will still be above 50%. It\u2019s now around 70%, low 70s. But that will change over time, and again, the relative profitability of these other countries tends to be a little higher than the U.S., so the profitability penetration will probably get there a little earlier. And in terms of currencies, arguably we tend to have a currency in the U.S. that on average tends to be stronger over long periods of time than others. So that will impact us, but we\u2019ll let you know what that impact is. That will be part of our makeup. Operator : There are no further audio questions. Richard Galanti : Thank you, everyone.

My name is Jodie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco's Q2 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn today's conference over to Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO of Costco. Please go ahead, sir. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Jodie. Good morning to everyone. This morning's press release reviews our second quarter and first half fiscal 2014 operating results for the 12 and 24-week periods ended February 16th, and our monthly sales results for the four-week reporting month of February, which ended this past Sunday, March 2nd. The discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. To begin with, our 12-week second quarter, for the quarter we reported earnings of a $1.05 a share. This compared to last year's second quarter earnings reported at $1.24. As noted in this morning's release, our last year's earnings figure was positively impacted by a $52 million or $0.14 per share income tax benefit that was in connection with the portion of the special cash dividend we paid in December of '12 to company 401(k) plan participants. Several factors impacting our second quarter earnings beyond that, these included lower sales and gross margins in hardlines, most particularly during the four-week holiday period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, lower year-over-year gross margins in fresh foods, the FX impact of weaker foreign exchange rates year-over-year when reporting profits from our international operations. This represented, if you assumed, no change year-over-year in the currency exchange rates, about $23 million pre-tax or little over $0.03 a share. For example, this year in Q2, versus year ago, the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollars is down 8% and Japan about 15%. In addition, an income-tax rate, even after excluding that tax benefit I just mentioned, that was still 1.5 percentage points higher year-over-year in the second quarter. Last year in Q2, as I had mentioned there were a couple of positive discrete items that had lowered last year's rate by about $10 million or $0.02 a share. As well in both, this year's and last year second fiscal quarter, there were few other discrete items that in the aggregate represented a year-over-year negative swing to our SG&A expenses by about 5 basis points, or $0.02 a share. While earnings results for the first four weeks of Q2 were very weak, our earnings in the subsequent eight weeks of the second quarter showed improvement. In terms of sales for the quarter, total sales were up 6% and on a comp basis up 3%. For the quarter, sales were negatively impacted by gas price deflation as well a bigger impact by weakening foreign currencies relative to the dollar year-over-year. That alone was about $200 basis points. Excluding gas, the reported 4% U.S. comp in Q2 would have been plus 5%abd the reported flat international comp, assuming flat year-over-year FX rates would have been plus 7%, such that the total company, which we reported, again the 3% comp for the quarter, excluding gas and would have been plus 5. For the four-week month of February, which included the last two weeks of the fiscal second quarter, comps came in at a plus 2%. This consisted of a plus 3% reported in the U.S. and a minus 1, internationally. Again gas deflation and FX had an impact, such that the 3% reported U.S. comp increase for February would have been a plus 4% and the minus 1% international, excluding same FX change rates year-over-year would been plus 5% and the total company, the plus 2%, that we reported would been a plus 4%. I now mentioned, which I have not been quite a while, weather. It has been all over, particularly in the U.S., snow, rain, just crazy weather. We estimate that the weather impact to February sales results represented about one percentage point hit to the four-week reporting period. In terms of new openings, after opening 13 new locations in the first quarter as well as closing our Acapulco, Mexico location due to the hurricane damage, we opened three new locations in the second quarter, two in the U.S., one each in Illinois and Texas and one also in Ontario, Canada. All told that puts our fiscal 2014 openings through the second quarter at 16 new locations and we now operate 649 locations around the world. And between now and the end of fiscal 2014, we expect to open an additional 14 locations, three in the third quarter and 11 in the fourth quarter. These 14, which again, this will be before fiscal year end on August 31, six are planned for the U.S., two additional locations in each of Japan and Korea and one each in Canada, U.K, Australia, and of course our first location opening in Spain in Seville in the spring, such that we would expect to end the year with 30 new openings for the year. This morning, I will review with you, of course, our membership trends and renewal rates, our e-commerce activity and of course, additional discussion about margins and SG&A. To start off, again sales, total sales were up to $25.7 6 billion, up 6% year-over-year and comps, again was reported plus 3% and a plus 5$, excluding gas and FX. In terms of the plus 3% reported comp sales, the average transaction was minus 1% for the quarter on a reported basis. Again FX has impacted that as well. It would have been a little over 1% plus with on a local flat currency year-over-year. Average frequency was a little over 4% for the three recent months. Frequency was just under 4%, just under 5% and just under 3% for December, January, February and year-to-date shopping frequency continues to be in the 4.25% range. In terms of sales by geographic region, both for the 12 week quarter and the four weeks of February, geographically Southeast, Midwest and San Diego regions were strongest. Internationally as well, both for the quarter, the four weeks of February, the strongest regions in local currencies where Mexico and Canada. For the second quarter, in terms of merchandise categories, within food and sundries, overall in the low single digits. For hardlines, overall in the mid-single digits. Within that, we are asked about electronics that were slightly positive for the quarter overall. Within the mid-single-digit comp range for softlines, and then fresh foods up in the mid high single digits, overall, with produce being strongest. For February, again, the traffic was up just under 3% shopping frequency. Again the reported average transaction was down about a little over 1%. But again big impact from gas and FX. In fact, just during the month of February, year-over-year, the average sell price gasoline was down about 10% for the month per gallon. From a merchandising category standpoint, food and sundries, overall was in the low single digit range, hardlines overall came in slightly negative with electronics being down in the mid-single-digit range, softlines was the strongest area in the mid to high single-digit range, and finally fresh foods mid-single-digit range overall. Again, produce being typically strong. In terms of moving down the income statement. In terms of membership fees, $550 million, up from 4% or $22 million from a year earlier of $528 million. Again you have got the impact of FX. If we assume flat year-over-year FX, that reported $550 million membership fee number would have been $563 million or up 7% year-over-year In terms of membership, our renewal rates continued at record levels and we continue to see increasing penetration of the executive membership. New membership signups in the second quarter companywide were up 13% year-over-year, again, mostly reflective of very strong signups some of our international openings, including recent new openings in Japan and Australia. In terms of number of members, Gold Star, we ended the first quarter three month, 12 weeks ago at $29.6 million at Q2 and it was $30.1 million. Business primary rounded both, Q1 end at $6.7 million. Business add-on at $3.5 million each, so all told, $39.8 million at Q1 end up to $40.3 million at Q2 end, including the additional card $72.5 million at Q1 end was up about $900,000 to $73.4 million at Q2 end. Also at second quarter end, paid executive memberships were just over 14 million, an increase of almost 200,000 since Q1 end, or about 16,000 week in the quarter, and again executive members are roughly 35% of sales in a little over two-thirds of our sales. 35% of our membership base and a little over two-thirds of our sales. In terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned, continue to tweak up a little bit. At Q1 end, business memberships renewal rates were 90 :1, at Q2 end it was 90 :3 Gold Star 89 :3 went to 89 :6, so all told, 90.2 up to 90.4 and of course that's U.S. and Canada are 80% of our company in our most mature markets. Worldwide, including all the new countries, over the last several years, 86:5 went to 86.8, so again continuing good trends in membership renewal rates. Going down to the gross margin line, we were down year-over-year 6 basis points in the quarter from a 10.59 down to 10.53. Again as I always do ask you to jot down the following four columns and six line items to give you a little explanation of components of margin. The first two columns would be the Q1 '14, reported and Q1 '14, excluding gas deflation. Columns three and four would be Q2 reported and column four would be without gas deflation Q2. Going across, our merchandise core reported in Q1 was up 12 basis points year-over-year, but excluding gas deflation was up three, but again continuing across reporting Q2 was plus 1 and without gas deflation minus 1. Ancillary, plus 5 and plus 2 reported and without gas in Q1 and zero and zero in columns three and four. 2% reward, minus 3 and minus 2. Then in the second quarter, minus 1 and minus 1. LIFO, minus 1 and minus 1, and in the second quarter minus 6 and minus 6. Other, which I don't need to add here zeros across the columns there. All told, in total, in Q1 '14, we reported year-over-year gross margin up 13 basis points, but taking out the effective gas deflation up, it was up to. Again, today we reported minus 6 and lower margins year-over-year in the second quarter. Without gas deflation, it would have been minus 8. As you can see, again, the minus 6, minus 8 without gas deflation, and our core was essentially flat, plus 1, minus 1 with and without gas deflation. For the second quarter, year-over-year, food and sundries and softlines gross margins were up in the second quarter year-over-year in the 5-basis point to 20-basis point range, while hardlines and fresh foods margins were lower year-over-year in the minus 30 to minus 50 basis points range. Ancillary business gross margins percentages were essentially flat year-over-year, but again you have got sales impact of a 10% year-over-year lower, the gallonage comp, gallonage in terms of price of gas. The impact of the increasing executive membership, again, 1 basis point hit. Just meaning more dollars going to their rewards based executive membership program. In terms of LIFO, in the second quarter, we recorded a $5 million pre-tax charge this year in the quarter. That compares to a $9 million pre-tax credit last year, so year-over-year a $14 million or $0.02 a share swing now is 6 basis points year-over-year negative. As I said when there either a LIFO credit or LIFO charge or this type of swing positive or negative, the fact is, is we really look at as part of quarter given that they work in tandem. Moving down to reported SG&A, our SG&A percentages Q2 over Q2 were higher or worse by 13 basis points coming in at 9.83% is percent of sales compared to 9.70% last year. The minus 13 translates to minus 10 ex-gas deflation. And again we will put down for us to put down the four columns and in this case five line items. Again, Q1 for two columns, Q1, both reported and then ex-gas deflation and then Q2 reported an ex-gas deflation. Going across, core operations was a minus 9% in Q1 reported. I mean been higher by 9 basis points, zero without gas deflation. And Q2 was a minus 12% and a minus 9%. Central in Q1 was a minus 3% and minus 2%, both zero and zero in Q2. RSUs or stock compensation, minus 5% and minus 5% in Q1 and minus 1% and minus 1% in Q2. Quarterly adjustments were zeros across the board. And then total was a minus 17% year-over-year higher SG&A Q1 reported, but again ex-gas deflation was a minus 7% and in Q2 two reported minus 13% becomes a minus 10% that I just mentioned. In terms of these SG&A figures, the core operations, again was a minus 12%, but minus 9%, ex-gas deflation. Within core, our payroll's percentage sales was higher year-over-year by two basis points. Payroll benefits or workers' comp combined SG&A by about a basis point. And utilities, of course, while cold-weather was higher by two basis points. Again, as I mentioned earlier, in both this year's and last year second fiscal quarter, we had a few discrete items that in the aggregate represented a year-over-year swing in our SG&A expense by five basis points or $14 million or $0.02 a share. That generally is the luck of the draw. Sometimes that helps us. Sometimes that hurts us. But it was a net negative year-over-year swing. In central, it was flat year-over-year, notwithstanding ongoing IT modernization costs which will continue which represented about a three basis point higher year-over-year hit to SG&A. Next on the income statement line is preopening. Last year, it was $6 million. It is up $2 million to $8 million this year. In the last year, we had five openings and this year we had three, but some of that's the timing of openings, preopening impacts several months. A big chunk of it also is the more significant preopening expense related to our upcoming opening in Spain as we essentially are opening a new country. All told, operating income in the second quarter came in at $724 million year-over-year down 2% from last year's $738 million. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was higher year-over-year by $1million, coming in at $26 million this year versus $25 million last year. Virtually all of that is interest expense related to not only the $1.1 billion fixed rate 5.6% interest that we have that will a mature in March 2017, but also the $3.5 billion debt that we issue last December, which has a weighted average in the low 1% range. Interest income and other was higher year-over-year by $4 million of the quarter coming in at $30 million this year versus $26 million last year. Actual interest income was about half of that $4 million increase, $2 million higher year-over-year and the other component was $2 million swing, $5 million plus last year versus $3 million plus this year. So that's $2 million better year-over-year. Overall, pretax income was down 1.6% or $11 million in the second quarter, down from $739 million to $728 million this year. Our tax rate for the quarter came in at 35.0%. Last year it was 25.1%, and as discussed earlier, a big chunk of that was the income tax benefit from that $62 million benefit in conjunction with the special cash dividend. Excluding that one-time benefit, our tax rate last year in Q2 that 25.1% would have been 33.5%. Still lower when compared to this year's 35.0%. Again, as I mentioned in last year's second quarter conference call, there were a couple of positive discrete items that went our way in Q2 last year to the tune of about $10 million after-tax benefit to tax line or $0.02 a share last year that we didn't have a benefit of this year. Overall reported net income of $547 million last year in Q2. Excluding that $62 million income tax benefit, it would have been $485 million and that compares to our $463 million this year, down a little bit. Next, in terms of balance sheet, which is included in this morning's press release, I will note a couple of balance sheet info items. Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $240 million and $471 million year-to-date. Accounts payable, as a percent of inventories, on a reported basis, year-over-year is down from 98% to 93%, although some amount of that is in the payables calculation is non-merchandise payables, such as most importantly construction payables, so looking at merchandise payables as a percent of inventories, the 87% last year would and 83%. Average inventory per warehouse was up about 4%, about $500,000 from $12.2 million to $12.7. This increase was pretty much spread over all the departments, nothing that really stood out. Overall, our inventories are in good shape as well as our mid-year fiscal inventories which we do at the end of the second quarter were essentially tied to last year's best ever results in terms of our low shrinkage results, so I think in our view a good indication of the inventories being managed pretty well. In terms of capital expenditures, in the first quarter of '14, we had spent $574 million. In the quarter just ended, we spent an additional $447 million, so all told just a little over $1 billion year-to-date. Total CapEx for fiscal '14, we would expect to be approximately $2.3 billion. I think it's a little up from what I mentioned a quarter ago, reflect from $2.1 billion last year and again reflecting a little ramp up in openings. In terms of e-commerce operations, we had four countries, U.S., Canada, U.K. and most recently few months ago, we entered e-commerce, we began e-commerce operations in Mexico. For the second quarter, sales and profits were up over last year. How? Well, we do not shared the profit stuff, specifically the sales were up 20%. In fact a little higher given the local currencies, given Canada about 20% year-over-year. Over the past one, one-and-a-half years, as you know we have re-platformed the site. We have added some mobile apps and we have combined some e-commerce merchandise efforts with our in-line efforts, we have added a few categories to e-commerce, most recently apparel, and some health and beauty aids, we have improved the timing of shipments by shipping out of three depots instead of one. We are currently testing (Inaudible) e-commerce operations, but we are testing in the Bay area one of several retailers with the Google Express, and we are also testing a few other things that we will let you know more about as we do it. Next on discussion was expansion. Again, we opened 13 in Q1, we have that closed in Acapulco with the hurricane, so net of 12. In Q2, three, in Q3, three, in Q4 11, so 30 openings less the Acapulco closing so far that will put us a net increase for the year of 29, which would be about 4.5% square footage growth, 4.5% to 5%. New locations by country for the 30 openings, 17 in the U.S. three in Canada, one in the U.K., two each in Korea and Japan, three in Australia and one each in Mexico and Spain. As of second quarter end, our square footage stood at 93,098,000 square feet. In terms of dividends, our current recorded dividend stands at $0.31 a share, 1.20, 4% share annualized dividend represents total cost to company of about $540 million. Lastly, our third quarter scheduled earnings release date will be Thursday, May 29th, that will be for the 12-week quarter ending on May 11th. Before turn it back to Jodie, one comment about Q3 I do want to make, last year in Q3, we had mentioned that there was a litigation settlement that benefited last year's third quarter gross margin results by about $17 million pre-tax or about $0.250 a share, so will be up against that comparison, of course. Let me just say that overall, I hope that you understand little bit about the factors impacting results this fiscal quarter, how the earnings performance trended positively during the quarter from a very tough first four-week period and a continuing strength in sales, comps shopping frequency and alike. With that, Jodie, I will turn it back over to you. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Dan Binder from Jefferies. Dan Binder - Jefferies: Hi. Good morning, Richard. I was wondering if you could just discuss little bit of your current thoughts on buyback. Then separate question, any thoughts on international membership fees and whether or not they do for\u2026 Richard Galanti : In terms of buyback, again, while we let you guys know once a quarter when we have our quarterly earnings announcement. Our intention is to start buying back stock this quarter. We continue to look at it, but I think it's a good statement to say that we will be buying something quarter. As it relates to international, we are always looking at membership fees. You know us. We tend to be long-term focused and when things are very strong over there, we want to keep pushing for even more memberships. We have the added benefit in most countries of being the only club operator and we will continue to use that benefit to look at it, but we are not in any hurry to do that. Dan Binder - Jefferies: And then just lastly on the expense leverage or expense deleverage in the quarter. Obviously FX is hurting a little bit, but where do you think the level is this year for expense leverage in terms of the comp? Where you need to be on a reported basis? Is it still close to the 5? Richard Galanti : Well, I think so, recognizing nothing is perfect. You take those things that I pointed out that in the aggregate we are five basis points. And not trying to be cute here but there is there is always those things that add up or offset each other and this quarter, year-over-year, they didn't. That's five of it. The other thing is, the biggest impact to our numbers were in those first four weeks. It's a combination of things. I think probably we budgeted it a little aggressively. Our numbers are still not bad for December for that four-week period. But there was four, five less Christmas shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas just based on how Thanksgiving was that fell this year. The other thing is that FX had a little less to do with it because that affects all the line items, both sales and the margin dollars, but I think some of it also is, while sales overall were satisfactory, they were little less than satisfactory in things like certain non-food seasonal categories were light. It was stronger in fresh meats. So again, as we mentioned fresh foods margins were down more and then you have the double whammy in some of the non-food categories. So on this level sales we had now, those types of things make a big difference. And again, I think overall, our margins were a little lower than we had planned, but some of it was very conscious, as you know, in some of the fresh food areas. And to get back to the leverage question, yes, I think a 4 to 5 should be able to do it but we had a few anomalies this quarter as well. Dan Binder - Jefferies: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : So, Richard, I wanted to drill down a little bit on the fresh food category. The margin pressure, how broad-based is that? Or was that a handful of items? And what could you call out among items? And then, is that more you making proactive investments or delaying price pass-through? Richard Galanti : It's almost all us. I would say is, aggressively it is all us. In terms of where it is, as you might expect, it's particularly in the proteins. We talked about chickens before. We have held the price on that chicken. Those 65 or 70 million rotisserie chickens are just part of the chicken. It is also frozen and fresh. And we are seeing a little relief in some of the pricing there in some of the costing. And that's just starting. I think it's starting a little later than we did six months ago, but we should see a little bit of relief there. Really beyond that, I don't hear, meat is very competitive. Meat is at an all time high in some categories and that's raining on everybody. Beyond that, sometimes in produce, we have a little issue. Produce was the strongest. It depends when it hits and some of the shortages that impacts us a little bit, but overall, I would say meat, pork and poultry is the biggest culprit there and it's mostly us. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : As a follow-up to that, when you look at having some more consistent markups than others, how do you guys think about strategically, right, because you are strength in perishables, we can or should operate with a somewhat lower margin, because we get that traffic, right, which then feeds into all of the higher ticket non-foods you might sell. Will that hold us to get other culture or not really? Richard Galanti : Well, that's part of the approach, but you again without trying to be too granular here, clearly the comment about how the impact of margins and P&L, of course, in the first four weeks versus the subsequent eight weeks that was dramatic. Part of that again was seasonal markdowns, both being aggressive and proactive and with little less sales in some areas. While TVs overall, I think, in the quarter were pretty good. You have got other areas. cameras industry-wise are down quite a bit as you might expect with everybody using smartphones, laptops, desktops, tabs as well, so there is some of that pressure and then that I really think that we probably budgeted a little off given the five few days, but at the end of the day it is hard to know whether there is - other than I can tell you is a heck a lot more was it if it was in those first four weeks, so trend wise that is good, but that doesn't tell you anything about the upcoming quarter, other than what we know that February was a little impacted by whether, so we are starting off quarter in those first two weeks. Last two weeks, February, which is first two weeks Q3\u2026 John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : Then lastly would you say, when you look at either gross margin or fresh food, some of the individual categories, I imagine there is a fair bit of difference country-to-country or not, and you know, is there more pressure outside the U.S. or less? Richard Galanti : I would say overall there is lot less pressure outside the U.S. The U.S. is fairly the most competitive with regard to the club business as well as competitive with supermarkets are probably the most competitive U.S. compared to later change everywhere, so certainly that is the case, but you know U.S. is little over 70% of our company. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom from Sterne Agee. Charles Grom - Sterne Agee : Good morning, Richard. Just a follow-up on that last question, when you think about the progression of your margin performance and it getting better throughout the quarter, the hardline margins getting better, I guess, intuitively makes sense as you move away from the holiday markdowns, but I was wondering if you could discuss, I guess, if that's the case. Then two, was the same true for fresh foods? Did the margins in that category also improved as you progressed throughout 2Q? Richard Galanti : I believe they did a little bit, but again world, as you know, we are all about being competitive out there and being proactive in that, but we also want to make money and we want to hopefully show some improving margins, but we are going to do what's right and each day on pricing irrespective of how it could impact margin that day. Overall, clearly, we looked at first four weeks and we took some actions and I can't tell you where, but it showed some relative improvement and that we feel good about that again this quarter is a new quarter and other than sales starting off a little weaker, we will see where it goes. Then a lot of that I think is weather, I mean, trend in the Midwest and Northeast in the Mid-Atlantic, the rain last week, I am not trying to make excuses, but it's been unbelievable. Japan, we had several locations actually closed for a few days, which is now the [nobody ever had], so lots of little things. I will try to not remind you next year when we chose a little better. Charles Grom - Sterne Agee : Just a follow-up to Dan's question earlier, when you sit down with the board every month and every quarter, what exactly did the push back to at least in your balance sheet and getting more aggressive what is the thought process currently amongst the board? Richard Galanti : I think, it is the topic that we always talked about. I don't think there was a pushback either way. As you know, we did little over $3 billion payout to the shareholders via the special dividend last year as the stock was ever increasingly strong. As I noted in a couple of the analysts, before the market opened comments, we have been a little under consensus expectations although that's not a direction, clearly Q2 was a larger gap there. Again, I think my comment that we plan to buy some this quarter is a step in that direction. I don't want to be coy or cute about it, but we will let you know in the quarter, but we will be buying some and we will go from there. The board is, as you know, we have never looked at it as let's do this because it will be a positive message to the market, but long-term, I think the board, as I am, are positive about our company and certainly it is accretive but at the same token, we try to be judicious about it. And perhaps we have been a little conservative but we also had the $3 billion dividend last December that helps us be a little conservative. And I think you will see that change some. Charles Grom - Sterne Agee : Okay, good, and then this is my last question and I will pas it on. Just on the price investments, I know you guys have been doing it religiously for as long as I can remember. I am wondering with some the new technologies you are putting in place, are you studying it a little bit more closely? Do you feel like the elasticity is there to justify the increasing price investments for U.S.? Richard Galanti : We would never look at it that way. We are out there, I think, again getting back to the simple circuit example, it's not unlike the hot dog example of years gone by. When prices went up, we just saw that as the strength of that and the growth and the number of tickets we are selling, that gets people in. We don't study and say what if we took it to $549 million and we have this many fewer shops or whatever. We know it's the right thing to do. Again, I think, Q4 and Q2 and that first four-week period, it exacerbates everything because you had all those things, some weaker sales and some bigger ticket items. Some margins on top of the ongoing fresh foods margins and I am very emphatic about the fact that our fresh foods margins are us, our pricing and we will see some an improvement there but rally when we feel good about it. Charles Grom - Sterne Agee : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank : Hi. Good morning, Richard. Just to go back to the comments you made about expenses. Maybe you can just help us, provide a little bit more clarity on how we should think about that going forward? Maybe an update on where you are on the IT modernization process? Anything else of note on healthcare, payroll and some of the other items? Richard Galanti : Well, on IT, I think now it has been about six quarters that have mentioned it, and there is on average as far as I remember something about 4 basis point and so that quarters five and six in this last, they were 4 or top of 4 or on top of 5 or whatever. And that will probably continue for another half dozen quarters. It's a five or so year effort with at least a three-year buildup in those types of things. There will be some quarters on a year-over-year basis when there is couple basis points and there will be some when it's 4 or 5, depending on when systems are being input. But we have a lot going on. We are excited about, the user groups are excited about some of the things they are seeing. We are going to just start implementing some of the components of it starting in early summer to late summer. Again, I am not going to try to be cute or coy here. It will take some time but we have got a lot going on. Again, a part of that is affected for 25 years. We pride ourselves on having very simple system and they are still simple, probably relative to others. For us, it's an entire effort and again so far so good. But we are a year and half into it. So that's going to still hit us for at least another year, maybe even longer on that line. Beyond that, in terms of SG&A, something its just how the numbers work in terms of the fact that you have got your FX, a lower weighted average of countries where some of the payroll percent or percentage of the sales of those respective countries and certainly the healthcare systems in those countries is a little lower weighted average when you have got Canada rate down 8% year-over-year. The Canada exchange rate. We have got Japan in Q2 down 15%, Japan Yen. Australia is down 14.5% year-over-year in the second quarter. So all those things add, well, insult to injury. The underlying numbers, they were a little worse in terms of expense percentages, but big chicks of this were in the things that I mentioned. And again, there is lots of little things and they all seem to hit at the same time on top of the fact that, in the quarter where you get a lot of leverage, in the four-week period where we get a lot of leverage, it was a little weaker than planned. Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank : Understood., and then, I hope you can just comment on inflation, deflation. What you are seeing across various categories? Just how we should think about LIFO if you think that will still be a factor in 3Q like we saw here in the second quarter. Richard Galanti : Well, if I compared it to year end just our entire LIFO for mid-year, it is up about a 0.25%, so just like cost of all items, there was $100 item that we paid $100 for it at September 1st, if you will. February 16th, we were paying on average about $100.25. As you would expect that there is some deflationary pools like computers, what have you, you have got probably the most inflation in food and sundries, little over 1%, you got a shade of gas inflation although that's ticking down right now a little bit. Overall, there doesn't seem to be a lot of deflation, but on a $4 billion plus LIFO, LIFO is a U.S. concept only, so on a $4 billion plus probably $5 billion LIFO pool, 1% would be $50 million a 0.25% will be 12.5. I do not think it is should be lot and I do not have in front of me last year's LIFO numbers for Q3 and Q4. Not that is treasury thing that in Q3 and Q4. Last year in Q3 and Q4 LIFO was a credit, a benefit of about $8 million, $7.5 million $8 million in each of Q3 and Q4, so if it is a little inflationary we will see a similar trend of swing that we saw in Q2, but we will wait and see. Mind you, when there is a LIFO charge, there is probably a little - Again I look at combination that with the core to, because they tend to work not always but in tandem one closing the other, so not a lot of inflation. Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank : That is helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan: Thanks. Good morning, so two questions. First, and as you model out FX at the end of the period, when you think that the FX might stop turning to sort of a flat scenario the total comp versus the core comps? Richard Galanti : I do not know and I am not even a student of some of this foreign exchange stuff, but you know when you see as an example, Japan first quarter year-over-year was down 20% second quarter year-over-year was down 15% for us in terms of the Japanese yen, so there has been a lot of weakening. At some point it's going to bounce back a little bit, but I can't tell you when. Canada has been awfully strong for many years. It is now subsiding a little bit, but who knows and then adds back the craziness in the world with events that could impact these numbers. Usually, when there is world issues going on, the dollar strengthened and I think that's a little bit of what's happening now, but also particularly in the case of Canada. I remember 20 years ago when Canadian dollar was $0.65 on the U.S. dollar has actually gotten above $1 for the U.S. dollar and it's come down a little bit, so kind of bounced after that peak, but I can't tell you when that's going to be. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan: Okay. Then just as a follow-up. The ancillary business, the margins in that business had been a positive for quite some time and it looks like if I got the numbers right, if it was flat this quarter what piece of the business is, is changing and is there anything you could send out the outlook? Richard Galanti : A lot of it has to do with gas deflation, just weighted average of that chunk. Mind you, gasoline sales as a percent of our company total sales is 11% or 12%, and so we think it is a huge chunk and we have got gas deflation. Our reported gross margin is in the whatever tend to have plus range, 10% to 11% range. Within that number, gas is in 1% to 5% range every quarter, so that weighted average coming down it has an entitlement number, so you got to look at it both ways. Overall, ancillary businesses were fine, no pharmacy business continued strong. Our hearing aid business although small is very strong. One-hour photo as you would expect continues to be a little weaker because nobody pictures, but we have been a little creative over there trying to do a few other things, but it's still very profitable, but not as profitable as it used to be. So you add it all up, gas deflation was probably the biggest reason. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan: Okay, perfect. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller from William Blair. Mark Miller - William Blair : Hi. Good morning, Richard. You gave us some additional detail this quarter on the four week versus the eight week and I want to make sure we had the right impression from this. Given you said that the margins, if I heard this right, on hardlines and fresh foods being down 30% to 50%. Does that mean in the remaining eight weeks of the quarter, you would have actually had gross margin up overall? And is it a fair impression that without those first four weeks, your earnings were closer to about double-digit growth range? Richard Galanti : The first four weeks, well, one of the things we talked about in the press release was those hardline categories that was more impactful in the first four-weeks, whereas fresh foods is more, again, us and continues to be in the quarter. But the 30% to 50% range for those types of categories that were down year-over-year was for the entire quarter. I don't have the detail by period here but directionally I would think the first four weeks was worse. It clearly showed some improvement to it. Mark Miller - William Blair : All right. Has Costco done market research looking at the number of your members that also have an Amazon Prime membership and do your merchants have any sense for how much this might be impacting spending at Costco? Do you think that might have been a bigger factor in the holidays with gift giving? Or you think that it's not a material change? Richard Galanti : Actually, I think some of you guys out there do more surveying of that than we do. And honestly, I have read some research out there that talks about the overlap. There is overlap. My guess is, clearly in areas like the books and CDs, that a changed business over the last many years. TVs, frankly, we are not bad, overall, and particularly if you add e-commerce to our in-line, we are up a shade for the quarter. I can't tell you what happened in the four weeks of February because they were, what we call majors or electronics, it was down in the mid-single digits year-over-year. But for overall, we probably fared better than most in line and all that stuff takes away a little bit. We are looking at ways to get, as we have now for a while, to get younger people here as well. We recognize that. And we will continue to do that. But I know, the answer is no. There is not a lot of discernible concern at this point of that. Mark Miller - William Blair : Okay. Thanks, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays. Meredith Adler - Barclays: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I will start by just something off from the last question about trying to get younger people in to the warehouses. Can you talk a little bit about what it is you have done or would consider doing to make that happen? What tools to you have? Richard Galanti : Well, first and foremost, we are not going to do anything rash, but we are also not gong to have us end here. One of things, the test as an example with Google among several retailers but in the Bay Area, has been interesting. I am not going to, again, talk about the detail yet. We have done a few things with some of the similar social media things out there. One of the impacts which is, what we do is the rise in organic. It's a big business. It's growing fast. We can actually show a better savings on those bigger ticket price point items. And we have seen that time and again, whether it's organic grown beef or those giant packs of kale or you name it and no, I mean we were doing huge business of that. And that also is driving in some younger people. One of the first systems going in our modernization effort is that a new membership system which we will start rolling out in the U.S., I believe in June, July. And again, there will be a lot more bells and whistles, but as you know, our systems have been pretty basic and primitive and we are not going to go crazy overnight on it, but we are doing a few things and it works and we will keep doing some of those things, so that is what I can tell you at this point. Meredith Adler - Barclays: Okay. Thank you. Then I just have sort of a bigger picture question. It's obvious that it's your philosophy to provide very great value, especially in fresh foods to your customers and you will absorb some inflation, but what do you do? I mean, everything I have seen - meat has been inflationary for a while, especially beef. Do you have to sit down and think about your strategy, it looks like there are items that are just going to be . Good morning think about do your strategy if it looks like there are other than that of and be inflationary for the long time. Richard Galanti : Well, part of the answer is no. We do what we do and part of it that was we also recognize that we need to you - our goal was to maximize shareholder value and ultimately that comes into long-term driving earnings and, but we are not going to necessarily do something in the short-term a given quarter to do that. Again looking at Q2, it was a combination. I think I probably said six or nine months ago, using it simple check-in example that may seem that there seem to be few months looking forward six to nine months ago that that pull through pricing, the costing list can improved which would improve our margins because we are not lowering the price we just not raised it prior to that. That's finally starting to happen, so those are the kind of thing that we will do. Strategically, at the end of the day, we have got to show improvement on bottom line. Ultimately, it is not that come from 10% and 15% comps. We are going to have good, but at the levels that we have and assuming there is still going to be better than others. It's still going to require some the margin over time and we look at that, but we are not terribly concerned about how it impacts the given, so organic helps. The fact of the matter is, is, you know, I think mentioned this as an example, and one of things that again talks about the younger members well. What we found is when we tried fresh organic around beef. I think in the first year, we did $25 million-plus in an item or two. This is at a higher price point and a greater savings and a fair margin for us, a better margin for us relative to a more competitive. The cool thing was is that 80% of those sales were existing members that have not bought beef with us before. They love Costco, but they are organic. On average, I would say they tend to be a little younger. That is my guess and so those are the kind of things that I think are going to help us little too. The fact that increasing penetration of our company is overseas over time. Notwithstanding the week exchanged rates this quarter we generally tend to have a little higher margin overseas where you even in the U.S, where you do not have a direct competitor in the market a mile away or less, you are going to have a little better margin, so all those things I think should impact us positively, but we are not going to change what we do in terms of occasionally identifying those key items that we are just not going to budge on. Meredith Adler - Barclays: Okay. Thank you for that. One final question, which is kind of related, but we obviously saw softness in some hardline categories, electronics has been bad for awhile, do you think at all you have to re-think how the products that you are offering because of that. Is there something else that you would be more aggressive on, would you take space away? How are you thinking about longer-term? Richard Galanti : Well, as you know electronics reach you when you walk into a Costco. Certainly, the online is part of that. We do a strong business online. Part of the business is not only bigger ticket, but bulkier is about both the items. We have a white club alternative installation as well and so that business is growing, but getting people in the door in Costco, we still have a lot of TVs as well that way. Again, you have a few unusual things happening right now. Cameras, I understand, cameras are down 30-plus percent in the industry. We are not that different. In fact, we have got a lot. That was a very successful and there is still a big volume business, but that has been weak year-over-year in a bigger way for the first time. Desktops and laptops, we started to get some traction on tablets of late, but I think that is a business and we - I do not think just say re-thinking allocation of space if anything is still a strong area for us, but we got hammered a little bit over that Christmas selling season. Meredith Adler - Barclays: Okay. Thank you. Richard Galanti : Again a lot of it was TVs or some of those other items. Meredith Adler - Barclays: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robbie Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, Richard. Richard Galanti : Hi. Robbie Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Two follow-up questions. The first, just on the gas deflation that you are now starting to see. Can you remind us, historically does it impact your traffic trends as gas, in general, if it does get very deflationary and come down a lot, do you have to find other ways to keep drive that traffic comp? Richard Galanti : Interestingly when prices are coming down, we actually historically, saved the member a little more because we turn it so fast and so we are buying every day, if you will. The guys out on the street is buying it every six or eight days or nine days. And so, when it going up, it is costing us a little more and we are competitive. We are still the lowest price hopefully, but there is a less savings. There is a little less news about it out there and so I think overall, on a macro basis, when prices are just coming down, even though we are saving the customer a little more, it is less newsworthy, the fact that it is not on the nightly news. And so there is probably a little less positive there. But given how big we are in that business now, it's not as impactful either way. Robbie Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got you, and just a different question. Can you remind us with your international business, how you are thinking about new markets? I think France, you have mentioned before. Any update on timing? Or when you could open a new country? Richard Galanti : Well, Spain is April or May. May. And France is hopefully about a year ahead. And beyond that, we haven't disclosed anything. In terms of how, there is generally the three likely areas and no order as other parts of Europe, South America and China. And we haven't really stated beyond France and Spain, what our plans are beyond that. Nor do we plan to discuss that right now. Robbie Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks very much, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Steve Tanal - Goldman Sachs : Thanks a lot. This is Steve Tanal, on for Matt Fassler. Just a quick one on gross margins. It sounds like much of the year-on-year decrease was sort of intentional or through price investments, if you will. And we are just wondering do we think about that going forward? In the next few quarters, at a minimum, do you think the trends likely to stay this way? Or how are you guys thinking about that near-term? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, let me correct this. With all the different numbers running around here, in terms of Q2, fresh was intentional. The rest of it was not intentional. Some of its promotional, some of it is what we do to have clean inventories, took some extra seasonal markdowns in some areas, including a little bit in electronics. So, some of it was that. In terms of the plans going forward, again, I have eluded to the fact that we are starting to see a little better costing on the poultry side. Meat continues to be competitive and rising. Then beyond that, I can't tell you a lot. But again, meat and produce, fresh foods was our proactive aggressiveness. The rest of it is doing what we do and responding to competition and responding to weak sales being a little weaker and getting rid of stuff. Steve Tanal - Goldman Sachs : Understood. That's very helpful, actually. Just on membership fees, we seem to underestimate the impact of FX there, but it also does seem like enough. I think that affects the overall comp. You guys talked about sort of two percentage point drag. It looks like it was more like three on member fees. Is there anything you could help us as we think about the split there international versus U.S. and how to get that right going forward? Richard Galanti : The biggest impact FX wise was in Canada, which is 10%, 12% of our company. I think a higher, a strong penetration of Executive memberships which is the higher fee. So those things probably pushed it a little bit. In terms of guessing in the future, your guess is as good as mine. Steve Tanal - Goldman Sachs : Understood. Then just to confirm that there were no buybacks in the second quarter. Correctly? And you guys are planning to buy back in the third quarter. Richard Galanti : Correct. Steve Tanal - Goldman Sachs : All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Nomura. Bob Drbul - Nomura: Good morning, Richard. I just got two questions for you. The first one is, can you comment a little bit? Canada was strong for you fundamentally. Can you just talk a little bit about the market, what's going on there? What's Costco's positioning and the second question is, can you give us an update on the private label initiative in Kirkland Signature and sort of parse, new categories that you guys are excited about looking forward? Richard Galanti : Canada is strong. Canada, frankly is not only where we (Inaudible), which is a positive. Historically, in the last several years was good about it. It has a good economy. It didn't have the financial crisis issues that U.S. had. It's got a of course part of its economy is natural resource base, which has been on fire, so those are all positive things. It has lower healthcare expenses as a percent of sales. It's just by the nature of the healthcare out there versus here, so all those things have been positive for us. Again, though we have got a 98% decline year-over-year in currency that washes that away in terms of how we reported for the (Inaudible). In terms of private label, I think some of the areas, apparel was good one that can be used I think to be exciting as talked [technology] about in last year about the a little [slack]. We have got a great [slack] now that's I think 1999, I know we had some additional items and so we are doing that that will be an area I think that will continue to grow for us. On the food side organic, where we are doing a few more items, which in a lot of places it will continue to grow. I think what probably over time, we have not appreciated is strength of it not only the U.S. or Canada for these items being able to take it to other countries, where we take a regular branded private international item to that country. We showed incredible savings, where prices have always been high. These items given the quality level and the pricing if that strengthens is I think exacerbated even more that is the positive. Bob Drbul - Nomura: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict from Robert W. Baird. Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird: Richard, most my question has been asked. Just a quick one on February, you made the decision to call out whether any impact there. What was the weather materially different than what you saw in January and mean you kind of said there were some stuff that happened in. What kind of kept it, because in the U.S. it just shows like kind of January, February were basically pretty similar. Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird: You probably live in that area. Now it is more severe in February. As an example on just the last week of February, the Southwest handled with rain for five days. Japan was to the company, which is another you insult to injury, if you will. I mean, I think we had what, 80 units in Japan? I do not have exactly telephone, so half a dozen or fixed rate of that were impacted in the Tokyo market. Yes, so again, that was just a little bit more, but overall, yes, it was more expensive than we have seen before. Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird: That's good color. Thanks. Then just on the club openings reflect you got to kind of get to that 30 kind of gross number this year that you guys are open for. What about as we look to next year? You are still confident you can get that number North of 30? Richard Galanti : Yes. Yes, I mean the Craig's had just drop of goal Craig and Jeff Brotman's goal are to get that at lower 30-plus range. I am sure, now that I have said it, we will get 28 or 29 but at the end of the day, they are shooting for 30 to 35 years for the next five years. Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich from ISI Group. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Hi. Thanks. First on electronics and then on the membership. You mentioned it was up then you listed some categories like cameras. That is overall down. Was it just TVs that drove CE, and was that ASP or volume? Richard Galanti : Excuse me. What? Greg Melich - ISI Group : Tablets? Richard Galanti : Tablets were part of it. Also the quarter overall was different in February. February was a little weaker in electronics. Greg Melich - ISI Group : So if we look at the -- Richard Galanti : The biggest chunk is TVs just by volume. And so that is partly why February, TVs were weaker in February, relatively speaking, than they were for the quarter. And they were actually about flat. I think the average sale price is about flat. It had been up -- it's up. Bob is saying it's up. Hold on, I have to tell you. In the second quarter, the average price point looks like it was up a 2%, and that's probably because we are selling bigger ticket, bigger with TVs. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Is that inflation -- Richard Galanti : No. By the way, one of the comments, that I heard at the budget meeting last week was that, the rollout of the next generation of technology in TVs has been a little bit delayed and it's going to be in a few months ago. April instead of January. I am being coached here. Again, that should help it a little bit but we will see. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Okay, great. Well, I don't think you need any coaching for the next question. On memberships, so I want to make sure I am getting this right. We finally have a quarter that's (inaudible) in terms of the fee increase. Richard Galanti : Yes. Greg Melich - ISI Group : So if we are up 7%? Richard Galanti : In local currency. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Is it fair to say, that in the U.S., while membership renewals are great and you have that the mix towards Executive, that memberships per club in the U.S. is actually trending down a little bit. If that's the case, has that shifted at all? Richard Galanti : I don't have that detail here. I have to look. To the extent that we have opened 14 or so U.S. warehouses and maybe a little bit, but actually, I don't know if I am correct on that. I have to look. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Okay, we can follow-up on it. But conceptually its still the mix shift going on to Executive? Richard Galanti : Yes, by the way, one of things is, I will give you an example, we opened just couple or three years ago, in Huntington Beach, California, LA. We have 50% plus of the households or more in the Greater LA market at that 40 or so locations. We may open up in a new market there with the eight to 15 weeks prior to opening the sign-ups tabling activities. As of opening day, we might have 5,000 or less new members. In the mean time, that's a unit that may very well, well exceed our company average for the first year, do $150 million, $100 million of which is new and $50 million which is cannibalized. So you have got numbers that are closer, they are going to shop more frequently for the first time. Contrast that, in Asia where again during those eight to 15 weeks prior to opening, as of opening day, we see numbers in the 25,000 to 50,000 new member signups with a bigger non-renewal. A lower renewal rate the year hence but nonetheless that should be a big difference. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Okay. That's helpful. Richard Galanti : So my guess is, that yes, it could be flat or down slightly, but that could be expected in that example. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Given the cannibalization. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch from Raymond James. Budd, your line is open. Budd Bugatch - Raymond James : My questions have all been asked. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research : Hi, guys. I will be quick. It's at the end of the call. Just wanted to follow-up on the inflation question and produce inflation, deflation and whatnot with the potential of some inflation working in to produce, you guys investing in price there. How is that going to work through, as we assume next, say a quarter or two, if we do get some spikes in produce inflation? How does that work through your numbers? Richard Galanti : My guess, it would help a little unlike. As an example, meat is so much more that's out there. Produce, everybody has got different items, different pack sizes, different qualities and we can still show great savings but it is just not, in my view it is just not the same type of level as competition. So I don't think that that's going to impact us as more. That will impact us as much. The biggest thing in produce is, is when there is a drought or a freeze and we are doing hundreds of millions of dollars of items, be it strawberries or blueberries. In a given month, you know you did $5 million an items, instead of 15 during the holiday item that was [freeze] that is more impactful than competition's. Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research : Then just one last one (Inaudible) if you don't want to, let's talk offline, but as you guys expand internationally because much more focused the growth and we have seen other retailers try this has worked well. It's working well for you guys, but just talk about the structure a little bit you are putting in place to make sure that kind of momentum up overseas. Thanks. Richard Galanti : First and foremost, we start any country with existing employees that are from our company. The woman running Spain is a seasoned, operations person executive from Canada for many, many years. The guy running Taiwan goes back to the price club days in Southern California. The guy running Korea started as a warehouse manager at Costco and before that I believe - but when we go over we send a core group of half a dozen people, have three or four people to merchandising operations. I think the biggest thing to make sure everybody is on the same pages is, these individuals travel to Seattle every four weeks or 13 times a year for a day-and-a-half budget meeting and they are typically here for an extra day and doing other operations in merchandising-specific meetings. Then like Jim for many years, Craig and others are traveling to those countries or often Craig out of the country today. The biggest way we do I think is everybody beginning on the same page. The other thing is, I will give you a good example. When asked for why have we been so successful in several countries including some of these countries in Asia, we think part of it is, is not only is our value proposition more extreme over there, and also that people actually do like big American stuff. The fact is, is that some of these private label items that we are developing now have been huge successes in some of these of other countries and those U.S. sourced goods, so I think all those things play well into our hand, but that's going to change over time, so we do what we do best is we are constantly focused on it. These heads of countries and [purchaser] countries come to Seattle at least four weeks know one of things that each of the senior VPs of operations in every country has one, Canada has two and U.S. has eight, but all those foreign ones, they come here and one of the things that they report on is what initiatives in terms of global sourcing procuring goods from a multinational manufacturer where the U.S. buys a heck of a lot from, perhaps Canada does, because we are big and they are now longtime, but because of whatever it is a licensing arrangement or regional pressure on their side. It is a work in progress that were making good success there. All those things, they are little things, but they help us every day, so I think that will continue. It is really a lot of that blocking and tackling and we had, just like we did when we went to Alaska for the first time and to Hawaii for the first time, we feel that we have really lower prices in those markets and they were more competitive, but we still shine better competitively versus other retail formats. Given the fact that in some of these countries pricing has been a lot higher. I think that has helped us. Bringing goods, whether it is in the Jumbo Cashews or the fresh blueberries to countries where they are buying a lot more of it. Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research : Perfect. Thank you. Richard Galanti : I am going to take just two more questions. Operator : Okay. Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Sandra Barker with Montag & Caldwell. Sandra Barker - Montag & Caldwell: Hi, Richard. I just wanted to clarify. Maybe you said this and I missed it, but when you talked about the 30 basis points to 50 basis points of gross margin impact, how much of that would have been sort of those response to price cuts versus proactive? Richard Galanti : Well, I guess there's three things to talk about. I can't tell you exactly. I know in and fresh foods it's just wanting to keep the price where it is on key items and doing what we do. If you think about, let's say, card lines, let's say whether it's electronics or whatever. Again, if sales are a little soft, we are proactive to mark things down to get rid of them before the season ends. Structurally, we have the benefit, I think, of being in and out of seasons early, but that doesn't mean we still don't have to take some excess markdowns some times. In terms of responsive, I would say proactive is more impactful than responsive, the issue of being responsive, but there is some responsive too out there. Sandra Barker - Montag & Caldwell: Do you see any changes in the competitive landscape and where is it coming from? Richard Galanti : No, we really haven't. There is still a lot of tough competition out there. We wish that part of the challenge with the Internet and delivery, there is delivery included and what extra things, I think we are getting a little better of communicating what's the value in our product, in terms of an extra controller or whatever it is or the shipping because when we do price shops, the least competitive ones are some of those that are on the Internet. Now I don't need to name names. Sandra Barker - Montag & Caldwell: Yes. Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman from Telsey. Joe Feldman - Telsey: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Sorry for prolonging this call, but just wanted to ask you, competitively I have seen a lot from, you are the big major club competitor out there lately in terms of, you are testing some stuff with online membership or your being little more aggressive in different countries. And I am just wondering if you guys are seeing any impact to that or any pressure or just how you are dealing with competitive issues? Richard Galanti : Well, in terms of direct club competition, no. I believe Sam's did a fee increase that they tested originally in Texas and rolled that out now in the U.S. They are only, by the way, in the U.S. and in Mexico. But we have that seen any, Sam's is very competitive, but we haven't seen any giant changes in that or us needing to respond to something that they have done. Joe Feldman - Telsey: Got it. Thanks, guys. Good luck with this quarter. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions. I will turn it back over to management for closing remarks. Richard Galanti : Well, thank you, everyone, and for the chatting in 12 weeks. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Baird Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research Greg Melich - ISI Group Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Chris Horvers - J.P. Morgan Matt Siler - Deutsche Bank Operator : Good morning. My name is Bridget, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Quarter Three Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And now, I would like to turn the call over to Richard Galanti, CFO. Mr. Galanti, you may begin your conference. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Bridget. Good morning to everyone. This morning's press release reviews our third quarter operating results for the 12-week period ended May 11th. The discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. To begin with, our 12-week third quarter results, operating results, for the quarter reported earnings per share came in at $1.07 a share, compared to last year's third quarter earnings per share of $1.04. As I go through the line item detail on the income statement, I will point out a few factors that impacted earnings both up a little and down a little. One item that I will point out upfront, of course, is the FX impact to the entire income statement. The FX impact of weaker foreign exchange rates year-over-year when reporting profits from our international operations, that represented a little over $17 million pre-tax or between $0.025 or $0.03 a share impact to the P&L to the negative. As an example, year-over-year in the third quarter the Canadian exchange rate, the Canada dollar relative to the U.S. dollar was down about 8%, Japan yen down about 6% year-over-year. Offsetting a little bit from strengthening foreign currencies for the U.K. and Korea and a couple of others but dwarfed of course by Canada. In terms of sales in the quarter, total sales were up 7% and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure was up 4%. For the quarter sales were negatively impacted by gas price deflation which is about 25 basis point impact and by weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar year-over-year which in the aggregate impacted sales by about 140 basis points to the negative. Excluding gas, the reported 5% U.S. comp sales increased in Q3 would have been 6% and reported plus 3% international comp figure, excluding gas and FX would have been plus 8%, such that the total company comp, which we reported a plus 4% for the quarter, excluding gas and FX would have been plus 6% for the whole company. In terms of new openings, after opening 60 new locations in the first half of fiscal 2014 and the closing of our Acapulco location earlier this fiscal year due to the hurricane damage. We opened four new locations in Q3, two in the U.S., one in Louisiana and one in Texas and one each in Japan and Korea. All told that puts our 2014 fiscal year openings through the third quarter end at 20, since third quarter end on May 15th we opened our first Costco in Spain in Seville and this week we are opening our sixth location in Australia in Brisbane, our 11th Korea location and our 20th Costco in Japan, so three openings outside of the U.S. this week. By weekend, we will be operating 657 locations worldwide and after that and through the end of the fiscal 2014 on August 31st we expect to open six more locations, four in the U.S. and one each Canada and U.K. Such that we will most likely end the fiscal year with 30 new openings less the one closing in Acapulco or 663 Costco\u2019s worldwide as of August 31st. This morning, I will review with you our e-commerce activity, our membership trends and renewal rates, recent common stock repurchase activities and of course, discussion about the various line items of the income statement. So on to the results, as I mentioned, total, actually, total sales in the quarter came in at $25.2 billion, up 7% from last year\u2019s $23.5 billion. On a reported comp basis, Q3 comps, again, were 4% for the quarter on a reported basis, 6% excluding gas and FX. Now looking the 4% reported comp sales figure, it was a combination of an average transaction increased of 0.2% up, of course, that was on a reported basis, excluding gas and FX, the average transaction was up just under 2% and an average frequency increase of up 4.3%, which by the way is the same number year-to-date through the third quarter. In terms of sales comparisons by geography, within the U.S., Southeast and Midwest were the strongest in the high single digits. Internationally in local currencies, Australia was the weakest due to cannibalization on a relatively small base of existing units with Korea, Taiwan, Mexico and Canada all coming in in local currency in the plus 8% to plus 10% range. In terms of merchandise categories, sales results for the quarter, for the third quarter within the food and sundries, overall in the mid single digits. Frozen food, candy and meat, deli were relative standouts. Hardlines, which overall was just above flat, about a 0.5% up, departments with the strongest results were office and automotive, consumer electronics sales were down in the low to mid singles. Within the mid to high single-digit softline comps, small electrics, domestics and apparel were standouts. In fresh foods, comp sales were up 8% with produce and meat being strongest, although, inflation on the meat side. Moving down the income statement, membership fees came in at $561 million, up 6% or about $30 million year-over-year and down 3 basis points as a percent of sales. Again, FX that $30 billion increase would have been $38 million-ish assuming flat year-over-year currency exchange rates. In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, continue to tick up a little bit, U.S., Canada for the, as of, for the quarter was up, the renewal rate through the quarter end was 90.6%, so first time averaging, rounding upward and 87.3% worldwide. Again, we see continued increase penetration of the executive membership and I will speak about that in a minute. Overall, new member signups in Q3 were up about 1%, a lot of that, sometimes it\u2019s up a little, sometimes it\u2019s down a little, really has impacted by, particularly by some of the Asia opening schedules where we get outsized new member signups. In terms of numbers at year end, at year end and I am sorry, Q3 end, at the end of the third quarter Gold Star members totaled 30.6 million, up from 30.1 million 12 weeks earlier. Primary business 6.8, up from 6.7 million 12 weeks ago and business add-on was steady at 3.5 million. So all told, member households 40.9 million at Q3 end, up from 40.3 million at the end of second quarter. And including the add-on cards, the extra card, total cards outstanding 74.6 million at Q3 end, up from 73.4 million 12 weeks earlier. At May 11th, Q3 end, paid executive member were shy of 14.4 million, representing an increase during the quarter of little over 300,000 new executive members or about 26,000 per week increase in the quarter. Executive members continue to be about a little over third of our member base, little over two-thirds of our sales. As I mentioned earlier, our renewal rates have continued to tick up, business members at Q3 end were 94.4% from 94.3% renewal rate 12 weeks earlier. Gold Star 89.7% from 89.6%, so all told 90.6% versus 90.4%, and worldwide, I mentioned, the 87.3% number that was up from 86.8% 12 weeks earlier at the end of Q2. Continuing down the income statement to gross margin, gross margin year-over-year in the third quarter came in at 10.62% of sales, down 5 basis points from last year\u2019s 10.67%. If we jack down the following little metrics then I will explain it, I\u2019ll walk through it. There will be four columns and six line items. The line items would be core merchandizing, second line item would be ancillary businesses, third line item would be 2% reward, fourth line item LIFO, fifth line item would be other and then the total would be, the sixth line item total. The four column would be reported in Q2 \u201914, the second line, this column would be without gas deflation in Q2 \u201914 and then columns three and four would be for Q3 \u201914 both columns and again, reported and without gas deflation. So, again, going across those four line -- those four columns, core merchandizing, it was minus, it was plus 1 basis point in Q2 \u201914 on a reported basis year-over-year, without gas was minus 1. For Q3 it was plus 9 and plus 7, ancillary businesses were, again reading across the four columns zero, zero, plus 1 and zero, 2% reward, minus 1 and minus 1, and then for Q3 \u201914 both reported and without would be zero and zero. LIFO minus 6 and minus 6, and for the Q3 \u201914 minus 8 and minus 8, other zero and zero, and Q3 \u201914 would be minus 7 and minus 7, so all told was minus 6 basis points year-over-year in Q2 \u201914 on a reported basis point -- on a reported basis. In Q2 \u201914 without gas deflation was minus 8 basis points total and then in Q3 \u201914 reported and without would be minus 5 and minus 8 basis points, respectively. So as you can see the overall reported gross margin was lower year-over-year by 5 basis points, minus 8 without gas deflation. However, our core merchandize gross margin was up year-over-year both with and without gas deflation of 9 and 7 basis points, respectively. For the third quarter on the merchandize categories on sales, food and sundries gross margin were about 20 basis points and -- were up in the 20 basis point range year-over-year, while hardlines and softlines were in the high single-digit basis point increase range year-over-year. Fresh foods gross margins were just slightly lower year-over-year less than 5 basis points delta, which is actually an improved, relative improvement from recent quarterly performance in that area. LIFO in the third quarter we recorded a $12 million or 5 basis point minus pre-tax charge in the quarter that compared last year in Q3 of an $8 million or plus 3 basis point pre-tax credit due to deflation a year ago. So year-over-year is a $20 million swing or about $0.03 a share. In terms of inflation, LIFO, if I look at just the, as one represented a factor in that, data point in that, if I looked at our U.S. inventories looking at the LIFO calculations, Q2 end versus Q3 end and in the 12 weeks there was about quarter of percentage point delta in the LIFO index. With foods, not food and sundries but canned goods and alike was up little over 1% during those 12 weeks. Lastly, other, last year in the quarter gross margin benefited from a non-recurring legal settlement received last year in Q3. This accounted for about a 7 basis point minus swing year-over-year both with and without gas. There is a little over $17 million pre-tax benefit last year in Q3, again related to this legal settlement which is about right around $0.025 a share. Moving down to SG&A, our SG&A percentages were higher by 4 basis points year-over-year coming in at 9.86% of sales this year, compared to 9.82% a year ago. As we did with -- as I did with our gross margin, I\u2019ll ask you to do the four columns, first two columns are Q2 \u201914 and Q2 \u201914, both reported and without gas deflation, and then Q3 \u201914 and Q3 \u201914 reported and without gas deflation. The five line items would be operations, then central, then RSUs or stock compensation, then quarterly adjustments and then total. Again, going across operations, the first number would be minus 12 basis points, meaning that in Q2 \u201814 year-over-year core represented a 12 basis point increase year-over-year in SG&A, then minus 9 and then in Q3 \u201814 those two columns would be plus 3 and a plus 5 or the core operations was improved by 3 and 5 basis points, respectively. Central going across the four columns, zero and zero, and then minus 2 and minus 2, meaning a little higher year-over-year, RSUs minus 1 and minus 1, and then in Q3 minus 5 and minus 4, there were no quarterly adjustment, so in that fourth line item would be zeros across. And then the final column, the total, final row the total, minus 13 and minus 10 and in Q3 \u201814 reported SG&A again was higher year-over-year by 4 so, minus 4 there without gas minus 1. In terms of a little editorial on these numbers, the operations component of SG&A again was up 3 basis points better year-over-year in Q3 and 5 better excluding gas deflation. Within warehouse operations, our payroll percentage of sales was lower year-over-year by or improvement by about 5 basis points. Total payroll dollars increased a little over 5% in Q3 compared to that 7% total sales increase. Benefits of workers comp hit SG&A by about 3 basis points year-over-year, so that was a little bit of an offset to that improve. Our central expense it was higher year-over-year by -- in Q3 by 2 basis points, which is actually the same number as related to the ongoing IT modernization -- incremental modernization cost that was about 2 basis point hits the quarter. There are a couple of other things that went both ways for those of that, that would be the one thing, I would point out there. Next on the income statement is pre-opening expense, pre-opening expense was up $6 million from $10 million last year in Q3 to $16 million this year. We actually had one -- one more opening last year, five last year versus four this year, although, that timing of that relates to both things after the quarter as well. I might also point out, of course, with the opening of Spain, you always have a significant pre-opening expense related to the opening of the country itself in that first warehouse that was about $4 million of that $16 million number for Q3 this year. All told operating income in Q3 \u201814 came in at $734 million, higher by $15 million from last year\u2019s $722 million. Below operating income, interest expense came in at $25 million both this years and last years fiscal third quarter. Over 95% of it relates to the interest expense related to the 10-year maturing $1.1 billion debt we have that matures in 2017 and the $3.5 billion of debt that matures over the next two to six years that we did back in December of \u201812. Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $3 million, so coming in at $15 million last year relative to this year or this quarter $12 million positive. Actual interest income for the quarter was higher by $2 million. The other component of interest income and other amounted to $1 million positive this year versus $6 million positive last year, so minus $5 swing. Majority of these negative earnings relates to the negative impact of mark-to-market adjustments on forward FX contracts used to source U.S. goods and certain foreign operations. Swings are caused by changes in dollar, U.S. dollar relative to local currencies -- local currency in certain foreign location as compared to the prior years and this, we just pointed out as part of that impact sometimes it\u2019s little positive and sometimes it\u2019s little negative. Overall, pre-tax income was higher year-over-year by $12 million in third quarter coming in last year at $712 million and this year up $12 million to $724 million. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate this quarter came in a little better or lower at 33.9% versus 34.8% last year. This was primarily due to the higher year-over-year penetration of profits coming from our foreign operations which overall have lower tax rates than in the U.S. Overall, reported net income of $459 million last year at $173 million of net income this year in third quarter. For a quick rundown of other topics, again the balance sheet is included in this morning\u2019s press release, but I\u2019ll point out a couple of balance sheet info items. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $237 million and so year-to-date $708 million. AP as a percent of inventories came down 2 to 3 percentage points, on a reported basis it showed last year 102% accounts payable as a percent of inventories, this year 99%. If you look at just merchandize -- merchandize payable not other types of payables like construction payables, last year in Q3 that 102% was 91% and this year 91% comes -- went from 99% is an 89%, so still down a couple of percentage points year-over-year. Average inventory per warehouse was up about 7%, on a per warehouse basis coming in at $13.0 million this year up from $12.2 million last year. The increase was pretty much spread over many departments, apparel was probably the biggest delta, the men\u2019s, women\u2019s and children\u2019s apparel was up year-over-year of about little under $200,000 and foods and candy was up about $150,000. Overall, though, we feel our inventory is in good shape and not a whole lot to talk about there. In terms of CapEx, in the first quarter we spent $574 million, in the second quarter this year we spent $447 million and in the third quarter just ended we spent $405 million, so Q3 year-to-date we are just a little over $1.4 billion. Our estimate for the year for CapEx is will come in at about $2.2 billion compared to last year\u2019s expenditures for the whole year of $2.1 billion, so up slightly from last year. In terms of Costco Online, we continue to operate Costco Online in the four countries that I\u2019ve mentioned in prior quarter, U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico, U.K and Mexico of course being much newer than the U.S and Canada operations. For Q3 sales and profits are up, sales were up 15% year-over-year in the quarter, a little impact from the weak Canadian dollar, but overall 15% on a reported basis. I\u2019ve talked about the various things we have done in the last year and year and half in terms of re-platforming and adding mobile apps and combining some of the e-commerce merchandising buying efforts with some of our line efforts. We have added a few categories like apparel, some limited apparel items and some limited health and beauty items. We\u2019ve started to ship out of more than one depot to improve timing of shipments, some of the bigger ticket items as well. Outside of e-commerce, there's a couple of things that in the internet area or things that we\u2019re testing. I mentioned before the Google test, Google Shopping Express in the Bay Area more recently in last several weeks. It's been tested in Los Angeles with some retailers not just us but in Los Angeles at our Culver City location and in Manhattan at our Manhattan location. And those are -- both those two cities are just in the last four to six weeks. Also we\u2019ve tested a few from a membership signups standpoint, a couple of social media area -- social media initiatives with LivingSocial and Zulily. Next on the discussion list, in terms of expansion. Again through Q3 end, we've opened 20 units then have the current closing of the Acapulco location earlier this year because of the hurricane. Q4 in total including the few that we have already opened, we\u2019d expect to open 10. So again 30 openings less the Acapulco location between nine net increase for the year. So looking back over last year and half, fiscal \u201813 for entire year, we had 26 units on a base of 608. So about 4.5% square footage growth this year, assuming the 30 net new units to be 4.5% to 5% square footage growth. Again 30 openings this year, 17 would be in the U.S., three in Canada, one in the U.K., two in Korea and two in Japan, three in Australia and one each in Mexico and Spain. As of Q3 end, total square footage stood at 93.7 million square feet. Next item, stock repurchases. As mentioned on the call, I guess about 12 weeks ago that we would -- that we anticipated we would begin buying back some stock. We began our recent repurchasing activities on March 7th. I think that was the day after our second quarter earnings results were released. For those nine weeks since then through the end of the third quarter, we purchased 1.6 -- little over 1.6 million shares at an average price of $113.14. Total dollars expended during those nine weeks of $183.6 million. In terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend per share increased with a May dividend payment from $0.31 a share on a quarterly basis to $0.355, so about 14.5% increase. This $1.42 per share annualized dividend represents the total cost of the company of about $625 million a year. Lastly, our fourth quarter scheduled earnings release will be Thursday, October 9th. That will be for the 16-week fiscal fourth quarter ending on August 31st. With that, I\u2019ll open it up for Q&A and turn it back to Bridget. Bridget? Operator : (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee. Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee: Hey, Richard. Good morning. How are you? Richard Galanti : Good. Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee: Just on the core, up 7 and then the fresh foods came down slightly year-over-year. Just wondering if you could remind us how that fresh food margin has trended over the past couple of quarters. And given the inflation that we\u2019re seeing today, what kind of your expectations so that over the next -- I guess, over the next 16 weeks? Richard Galanti : Yeah, well, I can\u2019t give you a whole lot of information about the expectations. I can tell you a little bit about what\u2019s happened the quarter and year-to-date. Year-to-date those components, fresh food is year-to-date. Do I have that here? The total consolidated, fresh food year-to-date was down about 22 basis points. And that includes up the -- down the 4, 5 or sub 5 this quarter. So for the first half of the year, it would have been more than that minus 22. Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee: Okay. So what\u2019s the change. Like what\u2019s changed us part of that? Is it a little bit of relief on the pricing front or is it something different? Richard Galanti : I think one thing that I one pointed out last is certainly I mentioned historically that we have kept the rotisserie chicken on the same price for the last two years when cost dramatically increased. We\u2019ve seen some relief there in the last quarter and so a little over that probably, that\u2019s one item and that\u2019s a huge item. In terms of that -- this factor but beyond that, I mean it\u2019s a conscious effort to -- we want competitors but we are also trying to show a little margin improvement. So that\u2019s the only thing I could point out. In general, as it relates to inflations, we tend to be little laggard when there is some inflationary pressure. My guess is, is that when I looked at the core components, so that the food and sundry is up. That\u2019s where there is more inflation. There is also some LIFO charge related to that. Overall, when prices are going up quickly, I also believe we have to raise them, when they were probably going to be slower than others. So again, that\u2019s on a general basis. Overall, beyond that I know here is a whole lot to talk about in terms of trend there. Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee: Okay. I know there are price discloses in the queue but if you could just shed a little bit of light on operating margin performance internationally. And then also in the U.S., how they are compared to last year? Richard Galanti : I think we\u2019re still cross checking those numbers and want to -- that will be out of the Q. Generally speaking, the trends that you\u2019ve seen continue, I mean, FX doesn\u2019t play into those numbers from the standpoint of percentages because FX hits every line item on a Canadian P&L as an example. Canada continues to be more profitable that as a percent of sales than the U.S. and other international overall tends to be in that direction, skews a little bit on a smaller base of total units when they are open in Spain or we cannibalize some units in the country. But overall, I think that it\u2019s fair to say that your columns two and three with column one being in U.S. are more profitable as a percent of sales than the U.S. Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee: Okay. And then last question, in April, you called out state of California is improving, the entire state. Just wondering if you could elaborate on that improvement. Do you think it\u2019s sustainable. And I guess, what do you think was driving it? Richard Galanti : Well, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s sustainable so far. I don\u2019t know about the future. When I called out just geographically some of the members I think, California, again the ones that were -- I called out were Southeast and Midwest. California actually was a little better than the Northeast and the Northwest, pretty close to the total for the company. So overall, I think California continues to do a little better than given its maturity and size. I can\u2019t tell you why though. Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee: Good. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : Richard, just a quick follow-up on the inflation question. A number of companies have said in the last four to six weeks they have seen a sea change in some items, it's all perishable. Have you seen anything like that or what you are seeing is more gradual? Richard Galanti : Well, when I look at, just again the various LIFO pools for U.S. inventories which is one indication -- LIFO pools of course are cost pools but the -- back-like items year-over-year. And again you start the New Year at a cost of 100.00 for everything. If I look at the -- well, I will call the foods pool. This is not fresh foods that have canned goods, cereal, all types of food items I got. That\u2019s up a little over 2.5% from the beginning of the fiscal year. In the last quarter, in the last 12 weeks of these 36 weeks, it\u2019s about 1.2%, so almost half of that delta. So yes, that\u2019s into the fee change. I haven\u2019t looked at that closely in fairness. When I look across items in terms of inflationary items, again just shooting down the list, looking at top 25, most impactful items to our LIFO calculation. There is several nuts in there, almonds, pistachios, walnuts, all the high teens to low 30s. There are seafood items. There is -- generally speaking those are types of items. There is few produce items, that tends to be item based not produce based, based on where a drought or freeze or rain was. On the deflationary side, it\u2019s the usual suspects, the bunch of electronics. That\u2019s a lot of the items, couple of small apparel items. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : Okay. And then again, I guess, beef in total would be a bigger -- is that a bigger sales item in total than your chicken products? Richard Galanti : Sure. Beef overall, I think in the last -- beef prices are up 10 plus percent over the last quarter on a year-over-year basis. So yes, clearly, there is more inflation in that. I think on the poultry side, there has been some inflation. But we were successful in locking in some stuff as well. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : Another topic on payrolls, you said up 5% dollars. What has the trendline been on that? And it actually seems like a pretty good performance for you. Are you doing anything different process-wise in the clubs to try to tweak that a little bit? Richard Galanti : Yeah. I don\u2019t have in front of me. I think the last few quarters when I pointed out payroll. That\u2019s generally been a slight benefit basis point wise, which would indicate the dollars increase a shade less than sales -- total sales increase. I think first and foremost it\u2019s sales. I mean driving a tough line is our biggest benefit. Beyond that, there continues to be a focus of things like overtime hours, lots of little things like that. I don\u2019t know if there is any giant process changes in the warehouse of late that I can think off. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : Is that the total number, if you look to payroll and comp clubs would be up less than that, right? Richard Galanti : What was that? John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : 5% is a total number. If you looked at it on a comparable basis, it would be less than that. So when you think about, at least on a waiver . What comp do you need to get leverage, you can get leverage on a lesser comp than you\u2019ve been getting, fair? Richard Galanti : Yes, probably little higher than some other retailers but little lower than it has been historically for us. We also probably get a little benefit from increasing penetration overseas where as a percent of sales, it is a low labor percent. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : Okay. And then just one last thing. Monthly coupon book performance, just curious; you have been doing a much better job in the clubs signing in the club what items are in that coupon book. Has that done anything to performance of the items in the book or no, not really? Richard Galanti : Well, I like to find out how you concluded that. First that, I think -- look they keep working it. It\u2019s a challenge. We\u2019ve done it for a lot of years. I think we\u2019ve first of all done better that timing is such that they are easier to manage both by the buyers and having it essentially, usually like a week in between them to give the warehouse time to move out what remnants are left than the old MDM and being able to bring in new stuff. Again overall, every time you do an MDM, you have more experience about some thing that maybe has petered out a little bit because we have been running it every year, every six months and the things that did surprisingly well, perhaps on a regional basis that we want to push everywhere. So as you might expect, we work with our vendors on that, figuring out how to best spend that money to both, also we drive sales. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : My comment was just that on the shelf itself. I'm seeing more. This item is in our coupon book this month, which I hadn't seen going back a few months. Richard Galanti : Okay. Fair enough. And that you are right on that. Thank you. I agree. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies. Dan Binder - Jefferies: Hi. Good morning. I just had a few questions, please. First, on inventory, you\u2019ve seen inventory tracking decent amount of sales in the last four quarter or so. The clubs look clean, at least the ones I visit. I\u2019m just curious what the driver is, is it the new clubs, is it dot-com, maybe a little bit color on that? And then also, I know you had an amazing turnout for job applications in Spain, curious what the early days are looking like in that club. And then finally on the IT spending, I imagine you probably have a pretty good idea of what that looks like for Q4, so should we expect a similar sort of 2 basis point incremental impact there? Richard Galanti : Okay. On inventories and a question related to where the increase is coming from, I think fairly we have -- yes, we do have more inventory in e-commerce because we are now shipping out of more than one location. But that\u2019s relatively small to the total, when I look at the total average per location. Again, the big areas were the conscious effort on our part in apparel and one of -- I think our success is that we talked about last several quarters is massing out and making bigger commitments to some items that have done, we call high fashion basics, but everything from true basics to seasonal items like shorts and bathing suits and kiosk items. We\u2019ve done really well in some of those items. So we\u2019ve certainly committed more inventory in that area. By the way, that area tends to be usually in the middle center area where we\u2019ve shown some areas like media over the last few years. As it relates to -- what was the next question was? Dan Binder - Jefferies: Just early days in Spain. Richard Galanti : Well, Spain, so far so good. We only were there for two weeks. We\u2019ve had good sign-ups, not like Japan and Korea but very, very good in our mind and we are pleased with the result so far in terms of sales and is growing. We have small baskets when people come in for the first time but we were pleased with the results. I really don\u2019t want to be, chew it either way. It\u2019s so far so good. And the last question related to IT. If you had asked me before, I\u2019d have said minus two. A couple weeks of ago, I would have said it\u2019s probably minus three just because it tends to be in that three to four range on average. It's probably in the minus two to minus three range next quarter but we will have to wait and see. Starting near the end of the quarter and into Q1 of \u201915, there will be a couple of other projects that go online and because you depreciate -- you capitalize those and then amortize them over, typically a five-year period, sometimes little less and sometimes a little more or up to seven and generally no less than three. But usually I\u2019d say five is a single point average. My guess is it will tweak up a little bit again. And as I\u2019ve said, our best guesstimate over a three or so year period in terms of incremental impact to SG&A would be 10 plus basis points. And we look down, I think this is about the seventh fiscal quarter, we talked about it. And so I had an average, if you look at all of fiscal \u201913, those four numbers and annualized the three quarterly numbers this year, we are probably in the 6 or 7 basis point or 5 to 7 basis point range incremental then we\u2019d probably have another three or four to go after that. So this is guess and a decent estimate but we will wait to see. Dan Binder - Jefferies: Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Meredith Adler - Barclays: Actually my questions have been asked already. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Thanks a lot and good morning. Two questions. The first, Richard, relates to online. If you could give us a sense as to what your members are asking for more obviously. It sounds like you are evolving the mix, are there areas where you would expect to grow the assortments incrementally based on member demand? Richard Galanti : Well, I mean, I think the areas that we\u2019ve grown over the last year relative to prior to that have been some limited apparel items. There is some health and beauty aid items and perhaps another replenishable office items, K-Cups, health and beauty aids, some small office needs. As you are probably aware, from the first many years, many of our items were big ticket and in many cases deliverable and in some cases white-glove installed items like big screen TVs and patio furniture and swing sets and the like and certainly some of those in furniture. Some of those are still our biggest categories for, one, they have been on for longer and two, they are bigger ticket items. In our own way, we are looking to see how we can get items on there that are more regular and frequent to get people return to costco.com and I think we are doing better, a little better with signage even in the warehouse with that certain items. Somebody doesn\u2019t want to necessarily have to shuffle it home and install it. They want to -- they are willing to pay for that delivery and certainly, our prices are very attractive even on that basis. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : It is just really a follow-up on that. As you think about the vintage of member that\u2019s doing business online, is there a difference between those that have been Costco members for many years and maybe those who are newer to the company? Richard Galanti : Well, generally speaking, newer to the company means less and less purchases. Certainly, when we get a new sign-up online because they are buying online, I would say generally, they tend to be low. I don't have exact numbers there. When we've done -- when we look at the age breakdown of our members based on how long they have been numbers or throughout the United States. And we look at new member signups through a couple of these social media things that we've done in recent months, what you would expect it to be. You\u2019ve got a younger member signing up through LivingSocial and Zulily so. And it\u2019s a relatively attractive cost of acquisition. So we are not going crazy here. We are taking baby steps but some of this stuff works. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : That's very helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise with UBS. Jason DeRise - UBS: Hi. It\u2019s Jason DeRise here. I wanted to ask a question on the margin decision on some of the food items that you sort of have a fixed price. I guess I just want to understand the rationale for not changing those and the comparison I want to make whether it's fair or not is that your fuel prices are not fixed price and it varies with what\u2019s happening in the markets, so why not with rotisserie chicken and hot dogs and things like that? Richard Galanti : Yeah. Well, that\u2019s right behind the black curtain here. Look, at the end of the day -- first of all, I want to make another point of the previous question. As it relates to -- well, I will stop with that. Let\u2019s get to your question first. In terms of fixed items, I mean, in retail, there are price points that are hot, I mean, the $1.50 hotdog and soda. I think we didn\u2019t sit down when they had said, let\u2019s decide that the rotisserie chicken should be at but its price has changed dramatically and we saw the competition raising the price. It was a hot price. Let\u2019s take a little less margin, take a little less margin, that little or no margin. And so I think there are few examples of that extreme. Gas historically has always been an item that there are some locations where we comp shop the price three or four times a day compared to the locations nearest us. So, I mean it intends -- I think it\u2019s just the nature of retail and the nature of what we do. We don\u2019t sit down and kind of optimize everything. We are merchants. There are key price points and that\u2019s how we do it. Jason DeRise - UBS: Okay. Richard Galanti : Gas, by the way is a lot more volatile, a lot more volatile and a $12 billion or $13 billion business for us. But it's very visual out there. I mean, people -- you go to some of these apps like Gasbuddy.com. There is a reason that we are comp shopping that item in some locations three, four times a day. Jason DeRise - UBS: Okay. No, I know it's an unfair comparison but I thought -- I don't know, just help try to understand the thought process between things like that. I guess as the follow-up on the last question, maybe it will get you continue to follow up on the answer to the last question. But as you do these -- as you try out social media or the LivingSocial type promotions to get younger members to sign up, how do you manage with the limited number of SKUs to keep both your core boomer shopper happy and then also have enough relevant items for a millennial shopper, or do you think that doesn't matter? Richard Galanti : Well, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. We are not going to keep our head in the sand on it but extreme value works. And again to follow-up on the previous question, what I was going to mention was the test that we are doing will roll now in three major markets into Bay area, L.A. and New York City. Arguably those -- if you look at the age breakdown of those, it\u2019s younger. That\u2019s a positive. Now, I don\u2019t think we are ever going to get your one box of Life Cereal and one box of Fruity Pebbles and two different types of half gallons of milk deliver to your doorstep at six in the morning. But there is a lot of things that we have. I mean, we\u2019ve certainly changed, frankly expanded the items out of the locations in the Bay area and you will continue to see that. So we are excited to see what the Instacarts and the boxes are doing as customer of ours. But they are small, they are new and there is going to be lot of things. So, I think there is still a lot of reasons -- not everybody wants to just sit home and type in stuff to have it delivered in the morning, people like to go out and do stuff. We are pretty good at getting you in the warehousing. We will have to evolve over time as well. But there is certain things in our model. There is a reasonable way to sort of markup goods on average 11%, on average 11%, on arguably buying power that\u2019s at the top of the heap in terms of strength and not always good. But we are open-minded but don\u2019t expect us to deliver to everybody\u2019s doorstep. If others want to, we will be happy to accommodate and help them do that with our stuff. I mentioned this last time and jokes aside, organic is getting bigger, not just for us but for everybody. But again just like we wow people in our produced numbers, numbers in our produced department, we have great quality on slightly oversized items for families. That whole organic thing is arguably. And again, I don\u2019t think we sat down and strategically thought about it. We look at what items work well and price of things and when it works, we really go after it. We\u2019ve seen surprisingly good success on organic and produce and fresh meat, fresh ground beef. And the challenge is the supply, frankly. There is not enough supply but if we can show great value, we will figure it out. Jason DeRise - UBS: Okay. And actually that was what I was going to finish up on as an example of something for a younger consumer base in the demographic. So you think that when you put these items on the shelf like organic compared to conventionals, you are getting enough rate of sale that all the economics from your point of view work or if it's not quite that level, you are willing to stick with it? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, the level of economics are still on an item basis. As we said, there is less supply. We just don\u2019t put it in normal locations and we love to have twice as much in some locations. But items live and die around here since the beginning of time -- since 30 years ago and certainly some of these organics are really starting to take off. I think so far one of the benefits that we think we had, I think I mentioned this before, not only in some cases, I think I\u2019ve used like the fresh ground beef example of organic. It\u2019s a higher price point. We get a slightly better or full margin -- by our definition full margin, because it\u2019s not football everyday out there in every supermarket chain. And to our pleasant surprise, 75%, 80% of these sales in this new item was truly incremental. It was existing members that didn\u2019t buy ground beef at Costco because they did buy organic and so it was incremental. And so these are all small examples, but they are going to grow over time. Jason DeRise - UBS: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird. Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird: Hey, Richard, a couple questions. First, can you talk about the level of new member sign-ups that you guys tend to see when you open up a club internationally versus what you see in the U.S.? I mean, how dramatic is that difference? Richard Galanti : Well, I don\u2019t have exact numbers in front of us, but we are in a well-penetrated, very successful market, like LA or parts of Virginia, New York. You might have and what we look at is during the eight to 12 weeks prior to opening when you\u2019ve got the parking lot partially done and there are some tabling activities outside where people kind of sign-up. You might have as few as 3,000 or 4,000 new sign-ups through those eight or 12 weeks. In a new small market, like somewhere in the Southeast like Louisiana, Baton Rouge or New Orleans, or Knoxville couple of years ago, you might have 8,000 to 12,000 because even though it\u2019s a much smaller market, it\u2019s new. We\u2019ve had some extreme examples during those first many weeks prior to opening day of 30,000 to 40,000 members in some of the Asia countries. It\u2019s somewhere in between there, Spain and Australia, so better than the U.S., but you know again the benefit is when you open it up in LA, Huntington Beach a few years ago or something like that, you may have fewer new signups where you are getting a lot, you get existing members in your shop more frequently because they got a unit 10 or 15 minutes from their home instead of 30 minutes. Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird: Okay, that's helpful. And then there was no gross margin headwind from the Executive reward, 2% reward this quarter, what's happening in the spending patterns between your Executive members and your regular Gold Star members? Are the Gold Star members kind of picking up incrementally? And just remind us where you have the Executive membership being offered, what countries you don't have it, and where you don't have it what are your plans for getting it there? Thank you. Richard Galanti : Well, theoretically, our plan is to put it wherever we can and make sense. I don\u2019t know if I know off the top of my head where else it\u2019s going. Currently we have US, Canada, UK, and Mexico, and I know we are looking at couple of countries, but I am not sure let\u2019s say when I guess in the next year or two we will have at least one more country. Part of it of course based on size, number of warehouses and number of members in that country, and you would want to get a handful of offerings going to be able to go with a handful of offerings to start with. I don\u2019t think the delta one is as we open, there is probably a little more sales penetration in some of those new markets. There is international markets where we don\u2019t have it, that probably impacted a little bit. I am not terribly concerned. It\u2019s generally been in the 1 or 2 basis point delta year-over-year in terms of how that reward impacted. This time it was zero. I don\u2019t know off the top of my head. I haven\u2019t heard anything or sees anything at the monthly budget meetings about any concern about that. If anything, we are continuing -- my one surprise yesterday or a couple of days ago looking at these numbers was the fact that we probably -- the 25,000 or 26,000 new Executive members, new and converted Executive members per week during the quarter is a little higher, certainly a lot higher than Q2, I think a little higher on average than the last several quarters on average. So we still get lot of people to convert and that\u2019s good. Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird: Yes. Now that certainly looks like that trend continues to be healthy. So it looks like the Gold Stars are definitely doing better. Last question, just early thinking on your openings for 2015. If there is not a number, maybe just kind of a geographic split, how you are thinking kind of international versus the US? Thank you. Richard Galanti : I think it would be similar to this year, 30, maybe a little -- hopefully a little 30 plus you know. I think I mentioned this year, if we get to the 30 from the 17 in the US, it\u2019s a little more than half, I would guess half, is it 45% to 52% or something next year, not 55%, but overall we still think we\u2019ve got opportunity in the U.S. and in Canada and every market that are extremely well penetrated. And we definitely have the pipeline more fill overseas now. If I have to guess, it would be a number north of 30 and south of 34. Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thanks very much. Richard Galanti : Yes. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research : Thanks, Richard. Thanks for taking my question. It's actually more of a big picture question kind of going back to some of the e-commerce discussions and just noting that one of your biggest competitor's CEO is on record yesterday saying that, if consumers just don't want stores, maybe we won't have stores, when talking about kind of the trajectory here in the US in e-commerce and whatnot. Now maybe that\u2019s because his stores aren't performing as well as yours. So I guess one of the things I'm wondering is you could say that Costco doesn't have as well developed of an e-commerce platform. You could also say that a lot of stuff you guys carry Amazon has been pretty aggressive in, yet your stores are doing great. Why do you think that is, what is the number one reason you think you are overcoming maybe demographics, e-commerce, and really just putting up some of the best sales in retail? Richard Galanti : Well, I think you mentioned some of the mix, it\u2019s merchandising, it\u2019s quality, it\u2019s quantity relative to price, it\u2019s extreme value. Arguably our demographics is -- I don\u2019t think you need to be an economist to understand that our demographic has probably been impacted less than the lower demographic retailers. Clearly gas brings you to the parking lot. Our fresh foods is a signature category and fresh foods is something, if jokes aside, if you like our rotisserie replacement or our whole meal replacement items or any of those great fresh food items or organic produce, that\u2019s the reason for you to come in. If you walk by the sweaters and the batteries and the patio furniture and the activewear, you are going to buy some more stuff. So we think that again delivering small quantities of stuff to home is not free. Ultimately somebody has got to pay for it. And if we are going to lose sales over time some of that, we will figure out how to not lose as much and how to drive sales in other ways. I mean I think we have been pretty good at that. But starting with average markup of average gross margin of 11%, which is nobody comes close to that, I think we will be pretty good, but we are also open. I mean, we are not trying to put any fluff in it. We like the fact that it\u2019s being exciting to work with Google to look with opportunities to drive business that might go somewhere else. Some of these other new companies that are doing things and using us as part of their platform to pick up and deliver the numbers at a small cost, that\u2019s great. So we will keep figuring that out, hopefully there is also some items that we only have and start -- usually that starts with the name Kirkland Signature or some crazy items that we only have that somebody bragged about that, they can get at Costco, whether it\u2019s some incredible price on branded handbag or bicycle or kayak or whatever. So there is all kinds of reasons to come at Costco. Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research : That's a terrific answer. When you think about your own e-commerce business, how do you prevent it from basically cannibalizing the heck out of your own stores? We've used it before, but we've been using most of your e-commerce for like furniture, stuff I would never get at your warehouse. I mean, how do you guys think about it as you grow this business and how it doesn't just cannibalize yourself and take your ROICs down? Richard Galanti : Well, I get back to the question is if somebody is going to take that business, we would rather take it. We also recognized that, I\u2019ll call the good old days when you only had one -- there was no such thing as the Internet, you only had one choice if you wanted to get that TV or that patio furniture at that price, you either find a friend with a pickup truck or go get a U-Haul and get it home. You had choices now and so we do believe that we are selling some of those items that would not have been involved in store, not everybody is going to take those items home that way. So we have to change with the times there, but we also recognized we also have to get you in on increasingly hopefully increasingly frequent basis. So you pass by all those items that you go wild, and I think so far we\u2019ve done pretty well at that. Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research : Indeed. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Hi, thanks. , I wanted to follow up on the membership fee income. If my math is right, it was up a little over 7% in local currencies and so, is that right? About 3% per club. Richard Galanti : Yes. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Could you help us understand what\u2019s driving that 3% per club? Is it at Executive membership shift? Is international? What\u2019s the bulk of that of 3% per club? Richard Galanti : Executive membership is a good chunk of it. On an international basis, again I have to analyze little more. There is more sign-ups per location, although in some countries converted into dollars, it\u2019s a little less than 55. And of course, we don\u2019t have 110 in some of those countries. So I think it\u2019s probably the fact that we do get more sign-ups internationally is probably the biggest reason. Greg Melich - ISI Group : But you think Executive is still a bigger portion of that than international if you had to then we will follow-up\u2026 Richard Galanti : If I had to guess, I would probably say half-and-half, I just don\u2019t know. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Fair enough, fair enough. Given the renewals internationally continue to improve, is there a threshold or how should we think about raising the fee in markets outside the U.S., given that we sort of know how it works in the U.S., the five to six-year pattern? How should we think about either a threshold or renewal rates or members per club where we start to model that in on the international side? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t know. I mean, we don\u2019t talk about it a lot. We like the fact that the new markets is recognizing. These new markets are also much smaller percentage of our total company. Thus we\u2019re to just drive business and drive signups. And we can worry about a little of that later. And so we look at it every year or so but spend all of about 10 minutes, look you had it and we\u2019ll see in the future. I mean, I don\u2019t see any preferred plans and making any major changes out there. Greg Melich - ISI Group : So fair to say the focus internationally is still getting the sign-ups rather than trying to take the fee up? Richard Galanti : I know, yes, I think that\u2019s not here on page 1, it looks 25 line page. I mean, the first order of business is opening units and getting into work right. And even in very successful countries and even with the support of its parents in the U.S., us, when you\u2019re going from 9 to now 20 units in Japan over two years. And going from three to six locations in Australia and a little over a year and a half, there is challenges. Nothing major, believe me, I think we have some -- every week, there is somebody from one of my departments going over to help out on something somewhere, which is good. But the same time, you always have some growing pains with that kind of stuff. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Great. And a little bit of a housekeeping, I think on the SG&A you mentioned workers comp hurt 3 basis points, is that? Richard Galanti : Actually benefits the workers comp. I think workers comp was actually flatter slight, a very slight improvement year-over-year as percent. Benefit was the bigger culprit. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Benefits was the culprit for workers\u2019 comp held. Was there anything -- so that was a net figure to 3 basis points was benefits and workers\u2019 comp? Richard Galanti : I think its like four and one, plus four and minus one. But benefits workers comp, we can always summarize together. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Got it. And then benefits trend looks like it sort of an ongoing thing as opposed to anything that \u2026. Richard Galanti : Yeah. The one thing that helps it, I mean, we read about hospital cost or becoming less inflationary in the U.S. We -- and I talked to few other different types of companies at a recent meeting outside the Costco and we\u2019re not seeing below as low numbers. I think maybe on a per charge at a given hospital or a given doctor, something\u2019s might me lower if its only through the Medicare system as example. But some of the things that have been added like up to 26 year old instead of 18 to 22 based on if your kid is in college or not, your dependants, on mental and medical health priority no limits. There is -- all these things have added, 1 and 1.5 percentage points to already large number. The thing that\u2019s frankly can help us more than that whether inflation is 5% or 10% or 3% and certainly if it comes down in the mid-to-lower single-digits that\u2019s a positive for us. But the bigger thing is the increasing penetration outside the United States, where healthcare cost as a percent of sales, respect to sales in that countries is lot less. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Got it. And then lastly on the gross margin, I think last quarter you\u2019ve talked about some of the gross margin about half of the hurts was self-inflicted or something you decided to do. It sounds like this is a quarter where you didn\u2019t -- you felt that there was -- even we decided to do that again. Am I summarizing that correctly? Richard Galanti : Yeah. Again, I used the extreme example of the chicken. Again, we went from two years of an item that arguably represents several hundred million in sales of having very little of any margin to indicating that as underlying costs have come down a little bit, we didn\u2019t change the price. But we improved the margin a little bit. Its one item that probably impacted us incrementally by 3 or more basis points over the last couple of years and is now hoping in this some of that\u2019s reversing, not all of it.  And we\u2019ll get a little increasing penetration overseas, helped you a little bit. I can feel that we don\u2019t try to get lower margin. We try to get lower prices but we still look to see where we get low. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research : Good morning, Richard. If we are looking at what proteins are doing, especially some of the strong inflation we are seeing in certain categories. How are you seeing your members switching between those and what is that doing to your gross profit margin in the edible protein category? Richard Galanti : I think from the last budget meeting, there was some switch from beef to poultry as you would not expect with the rising prices with beef. I don\u2019t have exact number. And I look at overall fresh fruits margin. Again accounts like would be for all down but dollar is up bigger surprise. I don\u2019t know if somebody had checked that detail. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research : All right. And then just a quick follow-up with regards to Spain, anything worth pointing out there with regard to the product mix as you open up that's unique to Spain? Richard Galanti : And the pictures that I saw, there are certainly some unique local items of Spain and Europe. But generally speaking, the many of pictures that I saw, looked a lot like Costco that you would see. As you might expect, like any opening and certainly as a new opening in a new country, there are probably a lot of hot non-fruit items where we\u2019re able to pursue merchandize and really show great value of exciting stuff. But I\u2019m shooting from the hip with this answer. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research : Got you. We both need to get over that. Richard Galanti : Fair enough. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Chris Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Thanks. Couple of quick model question. So by the nature of the LIFO calculation, you had a 7 basis point benefit last year in the fourth quarter, just by the fact that you have a benefit, does that end up being a negative this year in the fourth quarter? Richard Galanti : No, that negative related to how it was versus the year before that. But we now start with that base of cost, if you will a year ago and really start with basis at the beginning of this fiscal year. And so how do prices trend? Again, using an index of 100.00 at beginning of times zero at the beginning of fiscal year and let say through the end of the third quarter I mentioned as an example like what I will call the food sundries pool, or what we call the foods pool, which is canned goods and cereals and things like that. From the beginning of fiscal year, it was up 2.6%. If they go up or down a little in Q4 from that 102.6% number. It might be -- if we went down a tenth, it would be a LIFO credit in the quarter, even though there was a small offset to the big LIFO charge year to date for the first three quarters. So it's really, if you think about it, what\u2019s going to happen in Q4 is what the index was for all the pools at Q3 and what it will be 16 weeks in. Chris Horvers - J.P. Morgan: But you mentioned that it was -- I understand, so sequential. So you also mentioned that price has accelerated in the back half of the quarter, so it sounds like it's more likely to be a negative. Richard Galanti : It could be but it probably will be but I just don\u2019t know. Chris Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then on the buybacks, you bought back 1.6 million shares. The share count ticked down 0.1 sequentially. So just curious, was that more based on the timing of the buyback during the quarter or was there more of a big impact from the stock option exercising? Richard Galanti : While, there is not a whole lot of stock option exercises. In fact, they are using the treasury stock method, that\u2019s kind of impulsive in the number anyway for options. If you have a big in-the-money option, which are remaining small amount of options that were granted in \u201905 I believe, so they expire in \u201915, \u201904 and \u201905 should expire this year and next year. We\u2019re down to a very few left, like if you\u2019ve had a, making the math simple, if you had a $40 exercise price on a $120 stock price. For every option out there, you would exercise three of them and then buy one share back, so that would be a net increase of two shares. So that kind of number is not a big number. We\u2019ve bought stock during the quarter, relatively speaking, proportional during the course of the period. So it was 1.6 million shares and my guess is that the rough subtraction to the total shares outstanding would be about a half a number of about 800,000. We said that calculation only went down 100,000. It would be some additional vesting since then on our issues. And to a very, very small extent, to the extent the stock price was a little higher versus a quarter ago and I don\u2019t know if it was or wasn\u2019t, that would maybe impacted a fair shape. But the big things would be roughly adding 800 and then subtracting -- I mean, subtracting 800 and then adding some due to just ongoing vesting of previous grants. Chris Horvers - J.P. Morgan: I got you. And then last quarter you talked about your intent to buy back more stock, any thoughts on going forward here? Richard Galanti : No, other than we started. Again, I don't want to be cute or coy. We continue to buy a little but we\u2019re not suggesting that. If you took the exact -- those nine weeks times, those shares, I think you get to a number in the $910 million year range. I don\u2019t know if it will be less or more and more than that next quarter on an annualized basis but it could be a little less, we\u2019ll just see. It\u2019s probably either less or little more but not a whole lot different. We will see. Chris Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then last one, just in terms of you had the Spain pressure and the pre-opening, as you look forward is sort of pre-open per store normalized back down to levels that we've seen historically? Richard Galanti : Say that again? I\u2019m sorry. Chris Horvers - J.P. Morgan: The pre-open, if I look at pre-opening expense, it ticked up partly because of Spain. As you look going forward, does the pre-opening dollars per store go back down to more normalized levels? Richard Galanti : Yes, generally because there was clearly skewed because of Spain. To the extent that we opened more international, they tend to be a little higher. Assuming, we open in France next year and again, we don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll happen. There will be another real tick upward in that quarter. Chris Horvers - J.P. Morgan: Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Matt Siler - Deutsche Bank : Hey guys. It\u2019s actually Matt for Paul. A lot of questions have been answered but I was just curious on online with some of the newer countries you are entering, you have a different plan in terms of the rollout of your online platform relative to the stores than you\u2019ve kind of done historically? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Well, I mean, I know we\u2019re looking at another countries to open and countries where we operate. But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a -- we haven\u2019t stated anything about when. Matt Siler - Deutsche Bank : Thanks. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Richard Galanti : Well, thank you everyone and thank you for joining us. Operator : And thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

My name is Brandy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Year End Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. You may begin your conference, sir. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Brandy. Good morning to everyone. This morning we reported our 16-week fourth quarter and 52-week fiscal year 2014 operating results, both which ended on August 31. These results are compared to the similar 16-week and 52-week periods in the prior fiscal year \u201913, which ended last year on September 1. In addition, we are reporting this morning our September sales results for the five weeks ended this past Sunday, October 5. I will start by stating that the discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. To begin with, our fourth quarter earnings results, for the 16-week fourth quarter, earnings came in at $1.58 a share, up $0.18 or up 13% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter earnings of $1.40. In terms of sales for the fourth quarter, total sales were up 9%, comp sales were up 6% on a reported basis, and excluding gas and FX impacts were up 7%. For the quarter, gas prices year-over-year were essentially flat, so no impact on the 6% U.S. comp figure. However, foreign currencies overall weakened relative to the U.S. dollar year-over-year in the fourth quarter with biggest impact in Canada. Such that our reported 6% international comp figure assuming flat year-over-year FX rates would have been up 8%. In terms of sales for the five-week September period, total sales increased 7% year-over-year and reported comp sales increased 4%, and again excluding both gas and FX impacts comp sales would have been up 6%. In terms of comparing our $1.58 earnings figure for the fourth quarter this fiscal year to last year\u2019s fourth quarter of $1.40, there are five items I\u2019d like to point out. First, FX, in the fourth quarter year-over-year currencies in the foreign countries where we operate on an overall basis weakened versus the U.S. dollar, resulting in our reported foreign earnings in Q4, when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $14 million pretax or $0.02 a share than these earnings would have been had FX exchange rates been flat year-over-year. Second point, LIFO, last year in the quarter we recorded an $8 million pretax LIFO credit or picked up of little over $0.01 a share. This year in the fourth quarter we have LIFO charge of almost $11 million or about $0.02 a share charge. Third point, income taxes, our income taxes this year in Q4 included several discrete items that in the aggregate increased our income tax line by about $8 million. The $8 million of additional taxes included a few positive items that benefited or lowered our taxes by about $7 million in total. However, these positive items in total were more than offset by a $15 million income tax charge related to our decisions to repatriate from Canada back to United States about US$1.2 billion or CAD$1.3 million or Canadian cash -- operations cash balances in the near future. In all, the $8 million net income tax increase from these discrete items, a negative impact to earnings of about $0.02 a share. Fourth item, our company bonus accrual, I discussed in last year\u2019s earnings call that our fourth quarter 2013 quarter results benefited by reversing or bringing back a portion of the company\u2019s bonus accrual, as our fiscal \u201813 results caused us to pay bonuses at a lower level than we had accrued throughout the year. This year in the fourth quarter our accrual for the year end bonuses was not reduced in the fourth quarter as it was -- as it had been last year. Overall, this represented a $0.04 a share negative swing year-over-year to our bottom line. Remind you that the bonus program impacts a little more than 4,000 people who participated in throughout the company. And last item I will point out is gas profits, this year our gas profits in Q4 were quite strong representing an additional $0.05 a share to earnings year-over-year. Overall, $1.58 earnings figure for the years fourth quarter was reached by several discrete items representing $0.05 or $0.06 a share in the aggregate that did not go our way. Now to the subject to new openings, for all of fiscal \u201814 we opened 30 new locations, 17 new in the U.S., three each in Canada and Australia, two each in Japan and Korea, and one each in the U.K., Mexico and Spain, that being our first unit opening in Spain. We ended fiscal \u201814 with 663 locations operating worldwide. For the current fiscal year fiscal \u201915, our plans are to open 31 new warehouses and also relocate four existing locations, 19 of the planned 31 new locations will be in the United States, with remaining in international markets. Inevitably, up to a few of these will get delayed. So I\u2019d estimate that the number of new units in fiscal \u201815 will most likely be either in a very high 20s or up to 30, plus the four relos. During the first four months of fiscal 2015 basically September through this coming calendar year-end, we planned to open eight of our fiscal \u201815 locations, six in the U.S. and one each in Australia and Mexico, as well we will complete one warehouse relo in Wayne, New Jersey. This will occur in two weeks from tomorrow on the 23rd. This morning I will also review with you our membership trends and other activities, our e-commerce activities, additional discussion about margins and SG&A, our stock repurchase activities during the quarter. I will also comment on the recent switch in Canada of our co-branded credit card offering that\u2019s going on right now. Okay, for the fourth quarter results, sales again, for the 16-week fourth quarter were up 9% to $34.8 billion, up $3 billion from $31.8 billion a year ago in the fourth quarter. On a reported comp basis, Q4 comp sales were up 6%. For the quarter our 6% reported comp was a combination of an average transaction increase of a little under 2% for the quarter and this included FX detriment about a 0.5% and average frequency increase of 4.2%. In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, in the U.S. with the 6% fourth quarter comp overall, most U.S. regions registered in the mid single-digit comp increases with Midwest and Southeast being even stronger. Internationally, within the plus 8% local currency comp, Australia and Japan were the weakest, do in large part cannibalization with Taiwan, Korea, Canada and Mexico all coming in strong in terms of comp sales increases. In terms of comp sales by merchandised categories for the quarter, both food and sundries and hardlines comps were both in the mid-single digits range for the quarter, and both softlines and fresh foods comps were in the high-single digits range for the fourth quarter. Within fresh foods, of course, we are still experiencing inflation in the low to mid single-digit range on average. For our September sales results, sales for the five-week September month, which ended October 5th were $10.57 billion, up 7% from last year\u2019s September reporting period. Again, on a comp basis, reported plus 4%. For September, our plus 4% reported comp sales results were a combination of a slightly positive average transaction, notwithstanding, almost 2 percentage points impact from FX and gas deflation, and average frequency increase of right at 4%. Cannibalization for the month negatively impacted our sales by just under 0.5 percentage point. Excluding FX and gas effects, comp sales for the month of September as I mentioned were up 6%. In terms of sales by geographic region, most U.S. regions were in the 4% to 5% comp sales range with Midwest and Southeast being even stronger. Internationally in local currencies, Japan and Australia being impacted by cannibalization were the weakest performers, while Canada and Taiwan were the strongest in terms of comp sales increases. In terms of sales by category for the September, our food and sundries and softlines both enjoyed mid single-digit comps, hardlines low single-digit comps and fresh foods high single-digit comps, again having a little bit of extra inflation there as well. In ancillary business comps, overall, in the mid-single digits led by optical and food courts. Our gas comps were in the mid single-digit range, despite average sale price of gasoline during the month being down 4 percentage points year-over-year. Moving to the line items in the fourth quarter income statement. Membership fees, we came in at $768 million or 2.21% of sales, that's up 7% or $52 million year-over-year from $716. It\u2019s down 4 basis points as a percent of sales. Again, we had strong sales in the quarter. In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates coming -- rounding up to 91% in the U.S. and Canada, and little over 87% worldwide. We continue to enjoy strength in our Executive member program with continued new signups. New member signups in Q4 overall little over 2 million new signups in the company. This was about a 7% increase year-over-year. This was helped, of course, by strong new signups and a few overseas openings in Australia, Korea and Spain over the past year. In terms of members -- number of members at Q4 end, our last reported number, of course, was fiscal quarter ago in mid-May. We had Gold Star members at the end of Q3 at 30.6 million, at the end of the fiscal year it was up 1 million to 31.6 million. Primary business was up 100,000 from 6.8 million to 6.9 million, add-ons remains at 3.5 million. So, overall, total paid member households 40.9 million at Q3 end and up 1.1 million to 42 million even at Q4 end. I would -- excluding extra cards 74.6 million at Q3 end, up 1.8 million to 76.4 million at the end of the fiscal year. Also at the end of the fiscal year, Executive membership's stood at just under 15 million, an increase of about 450,000 just in the 16-week quarter or about 28,000 increase per week of new Executive members. In terms of membership renewal rates, they too continue strong. Again at the end of the third quarter, business renewal rates were 94.4%. They remained there at Q4 end. Gold Star renewal rates ticked up a little bit from 89.7% to 89.8%. Overall, we remained at 90.6%, rounding up to 91%. Again worldwide, we continued at 87.3%. Now as I\u2019ve touched on the last couple of quarters\u2019 conference calls, we continue to try a few new things to drive both sales and new member signups. In early September, this would be the first couple weeks of the first quarter of the new fiscal year. For eight days, we ran a nationwide membership promotion for new members on Living Social with the purchase of a full price $55 membership. The new member received a $20 Costco Cash card, coupons for three free items. As you might expect, they include a Kirkland Signature bath tissue, an apple pie, and rotisserie chicken, also a free three month membership for identity protection and a bonus coupon of $25 off of any Costco.com offer purchase of $250 or more. These types of promotions we believe will allow us to get in front of the other demographics and with an appealing offer. This one worked well and we\u2019ll keep you posted. Lastly, I want to mention that in Canada, it was announced last week that the Costco Canada\u2019s co-branded critical offering is being switched from a Costco American Express co-branded card to a new co-branded Costco Capital One Platinum MasterCard. This will be exclusive to Costco members. We've already begun to issue the new MasterCards and we will continue to accept all AmEx cards through December 31st of this year. Our new no-annual-fee credit card doubles as the membership card and allows our members to earn cash rewards on all purchases made both inside and outside the Costco with no cap on the amount of rewards that can be earned. Getting back to the income statement, our gross margin in the fourth quarter was quite strong coming in up 15 basis points year-over-year from 10.55% year ago in the fourth to 10.70% during the fourth quarter of this last fiscal year. As usual, I\u2019ll ask you to jot down a few numbers. We\u2019ll do four columns. This time the four columns -- the first two columns be for Q4 \u201814 both as reported and without gas inflation and then for the entire fiscal year \u201814 reported and without gas inflation or deflation. First line item is core merchandise. In the fourth quarter, we have a year-over-year, core was up six basis points both with and without gas because gas year-over-year was essentially flat. For the year, plus 6 reported and a plus 3 without gas. Ancillary and other businesses, a big contributor in Q4 plus 15 basis points in the first two columns there and for the year plus 6 and plus 6. The 2% reward no impact in the Q4 both in those two columns, a minus 1 basis point impact in the next two columns. LIFO, as I mentioned, of course, there was a charge this year versus a credit last year, 6 basis points year-over-year both in the fourth-quarter columns and minus 5 basis points year-over-year for the entire fiscal year in both columns. Other, no additional items in the fourth quarter. In the last two columns for fiscal \u201914, minus 2 basis points year-over-year that related to a lawsuit recovery over a year ago that benefited us and of course, we didn't have any unusual item offsetting that benefit from a year ago. If you added up, we reported margins up 15 basis points both with and without gas. Our reported total for the year was up 4 basis points but taking out gas, it was up one basis point. So again, a good showing overall in the fourth quarter in terms of margin improvement. Now as I mentioned, the core was up 6 basis points. Two of the four core categories, food and sundries and fresh food show higher year-over-year gross margin percentages while year-over-year in Q4, softlines margins were essentially flat year-over-year and hardlines margins were slightly lower. Ancillary business gross margins were up over 50 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter based on their own sales with gas, optical and hearing aids coming in better year-over-year in Q4. And LIFO again in the fourth quarter, we recorded just under $11 million or 3 basis point pretax charge compared to an $8 million or 3 basis point pretax credit last year for 6 basis point year-over-year swing in the fourth quarter. Next our SG&A percentages, year-over-year in the fourth quarter, they were lower or better by two basis points coming in at 97.3% as percent of sales, compared to 97.5% last year. Again we\u2019ll do the same four columns, two for the fourth quarter with and without gas and two for the full fiscal year with reported and without gas. In terms of core operations, we have two, a plus 7 and a plus 7 for the quarter and minus 2 and a plus 1 for the fiscal year. So plus 7 of course would mean that it was lower or better by that many basis points. Central was minus 7 and minus 7 for the quarter and minus 3 and minus 3 for the year. RSUs a plus 2 and a plus 2 and for the year a minus 2 and a minus 2 and no quarterly adjustments. So total for the quarter both on reported basis without gas, again we were better by 2 basis point or plus 2. For the year, we are higher by seven basis points on a reported basis or minus 7 and without gas minus 4. Now in terms of our SG&A performance, the core operations again was lower or better by seven basis points. Within core payroll -- within core, payroll and benefits expenses were lower or better year-over-year by 8 basis points, again helped by leveraging sales strength. Similarly other operating expenses as a percent of sales in the quarter were better by four basis points. So total between those two, those three items really would be 12 basis points. The change in the bonus accrual year-over-year as I discussed earlier, hurt the core component by about five basis points. In terms of central, it was higher again by 7 basis points. About five of that is SG&A variance is related to the ongoing IT modernization efforts and another three is the increased SG&A expense resulting from the year-over-year swing in bonus accrual that\u2019s split between core and central. And lastly our equity compensation, which is now an important component of the composition to again to about 4000 people. This represented an improvement of 2 basis point positive in SG&A, benefiting from both timing of certain vesting provisions when employees hit 25, 30 and 35 years of service as well as from the strong sales denominator in the fourth quarter. Next on income statement line preopening, not a whole lot to talk about, $17 million last year in the quarter, $15 million of charges this year in the quarter. Last year, we opened seven units, this year 10, no major surprises there. All told, operating income in the fourth quarter increased 14% or $137 million year-over-year from $954 million last year in the fourth quarter to almost $1.1 billion, $1.91 billion this year in the fourth quarter. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was $1 million lower year-over-year coming in at $36 million last year and coming in this year at $35 million for the quarter. Interest income and other, it was lower year-over-year by $6 million, 36 million last year in the fourth quarter compared to $30 million this year. Actual interest income for the quarter was up $3 million coming in at $17 million, compared to $14 million last year. The other component of interest income -- of interest income and other was lower by $8 million, primarily related to various FX items being mark-to-market at fiscal quarter end. Overall pretax income was up 14% or $132 million to $1.86 billion this year versus last year's fourth quarter, a pretax earnings of $954 million. In terms of income taxes, tax rate for the quarter came in at 35.1, up three-tenth of a 1% from 34.8% tax rate all in last year. So slightly higher this year and as I explained the reasons for that earlier in the call. Overall net income was up 13% or $80 million to $697 million versus last year's fourth quarter of $617 million. And as I discussed earlier, this figure being achieved notwithstanding several items that in the aggregate did not go our way. Now for quick rundown of other usual topics, the condensed balance sheet is included in this morning's press release with a couple of items from the balance sheet and the couple cash flow items I will point out here. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $321 million and for the year $1.29 billion. In terms of accounts payable as a percent of inventory, on a reported basis both last year and this year's fourth quarter, it was right at 100%. Payables, of course, include things other than merchandise payables like construction payables. If you look at just merchandise payables as percent of inventory in both fiscal quarters, we were at 89% year-over-year. So almost 90% of our inventories being financed with trade payables. Average inventory per warehouse, last year fourth quarter end, $12.5 million, up a tick this year in the fourth quarter at $12.8 million, we\u2019re up about $300,000 or 2%. The $300,000 increase, about 80% of that is in four of our merchandised subdepartments. Majors was up about $91,000, some of that is the reintroduction of Apple products. Men's apparel was up about $55,000. Foods was up $61,000 and meats were up $39,000, the latter two being somewhat related to inflation. In terms of CapEx, in the fourth quarter we spent $567 million. For all of fiscal \u201814, total CapEx was right at $2 billion. Our estimate for fiscal \u201815 CapEx is quite a bit higher, probably in $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion range. The year-over-year increase in CapEx represents our plans for more openings this year that of course includes the four relos versus last year. Increased spending for remodeling activities and expanding ancillary business operations, planned expansion of our cross-stock depot operations, anticipate spending later in the year for some additional openings earlier in fiscal -- in the subsequent fiscal year and increased level of IT spending for the modernization efforts. In terms of Costco online, we\u2019re currently operated in four countries, U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico. We\u2019d expect to be in at least one, probably two additional countries by the end of calendar \u201815. For the fiscal year, total e-commerce sales came in just under $3 billion. For both fiscal fourth quarter and the fiscal year, sales and profits were up. Sales in e-commerce were up in the high teens for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year and comp sales in e-commerce were up in the 18% to 19% range for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Over the past two years as I mentioned, we replatformed our site, we've introduced new apps. We\u2019ve combined some e-commerce merchandising efforts within line efforts. We've added new categories including areas like apparel, health and beauty aids, and some sundries. And we've improved distribution and delivery time. In addition, outside of e-commerce as you know, we\u2019ve continued over the last -- much of this past calendar year testing Google Shopping Express. That continues with a great partner with Google. The trending is positive in terms of member spending and also signing up some new members. But again it\u2019s still a test. We continued to add items to that delivery process. Currently, it's in three geographic areas, the Bay Area, Los Angeles and New York and more to come, I\u2019m sure. Next discussion in terms of expansion. Again for fiscal \u201914 as ended, we opened 30. Acapulco was closed due to weather-related destruction, so ended up a net of increase last year of 29. This year, assuming, we opened the planned 31 and we open 35 but those are relos, so a planned net new of 31. Eight would be in the first quarter, none in the second quarter, two in the third quarter and 21 in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve got a lot going on, I think, that again we will probably see, at least couple of them. One or two of those perhaps to be up a little bit, but few be pushed into the next -- early the next fiscal year. So in fiscal 14, we added 29 on a base of 634 or about 5% square footage growth. In fiscal \u201915, assuming 31, it will be about 4.5% to 5% square footage growth. In terms of the 31 this year, if we get all those open, 19 would be in the U.S., one each in Canada and the U.K. In Asia overall six, three in Korea, two in Japan and one in Taiwan, one additional in Australia that we are seventh in Australia, two more in Mexico and one more in Spain. As of Q4 end, total square footage stood at 95.3 million square feet. One last comment regarding openings and operations in Cabo San Lucas Mexico, Costco like many other businesses was a victim of the recent hurricane on September \u201814th and the subsequent looting that took place and that we are currently closed. We plan to be back up and operating by early November. In terms of common stock repurchases, we began our recent repurchasing activities on March 7th, the day after our second quarter earnings release was released. In Q3, we purchased 1.6 million shares at an average price of $113.14 for a total spend of just under $184 million. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 1.3 million shares at an average price of $116.11, or a total dollar amount of $150 million. In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.355 a share or annualizes a $1.42, that's up 14.5% from the previous year\u2019s dividend rate. This $1.42 per share divided represents an annual cost of the company of about $625 million. Lastly, our fiscal \u201815 first quarter scheduled earnings release date will be Thursday, December 11th, for that will be for the 12-week this first quarter ending on November 23rd. With that, I'll turn it over to Brandy for Q&A. Brandy? Operator : (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : So, Richard, a few things, the gross margin being up in the food categories, is that cost of product to you? I know you talk about inflation, but is that cost of product driven, is that mix driven, where is that coming from? Richard Galanti : Without looking at the detail, yes, most of it is cost of product driven. The examples of course would be, I mentioned before poultry prices to us have come down a little bit as we locked in versus where they had been. We didn\u2019t change the price, needless to say, of those items upward. I think we\u2019ve had a little bit of hit in the food court similarly for that reason. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : Do you think -- as Kirkland gets bigger and gets more scaled, do you think there is -- can that move the needle on gross margin either in terms of margin on the product or mix? Richard Galanti : I think it does a couple of things. Generally, the answer is yes. And also as KS product takes share from a branded product, it generally move the branded product to come down and price to us, which again gives us even more competitive loyalty with our members. So there's a lot of good things there. Certainly, the needle -- the low-hanging fruit occurred many years ago. You've heard examples of, whether it\u2019s toilet paper or disposable diapers where you have items that are very, very competitive branded items. We can come in with a great value, a great quality item and make a fairer margin to us but still a great savings to the customer. So it works but it moves the needle slightly. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : One of the countries you didn\u2019t talk about, good or bad was the U.K. Obviously there's a lot going on there. Just generally speaking, how do you find you are performing in the U.K. top and bottom line today? Richard Galanti : Well, two things to finish some thing I thought about after I finished the first answer. The added benefit of course is not just KS but the increase in organic sales. That\u2019s something I think that competitively gives us a leg up, because it's where more margin historically has been made in retail organic. We can provide better savings and has other positive attributes in terms of the type of member that shops with that stuff. In terms of the U.K., it was still positive. It was at the lower end low single digits. Actually, U.K. has shown some improvement. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : You mentioned organic. Two things. What is happening to assortment there? And then secondly, it does look like on a variety of levels in terms of just product placement, marketing, you are trying to drive that significantly. So that\u2019s got to be still one of the fastest-growing departments in food. Do you think that -- is that helping you much with the Millennials or is that yet to come? Richard Galanti : Well, it\u2019s helping. It\u2019s probably a bigger percentage now because it\u2019s on a small base. You look at, I think couple of quarters ago I talked about like fresh ground beef, organic ground. It\u2019s an infinite percentage increase from 0 to 25 or so million of that first year. As I mentioned earlier, what we are finding with all of these items is that it\u2019s incremental sales because it was loyal members that didn't buy ground beef from us before, now they are. This year, organic ground beef sales were up dramatically because the supply is up dramatically. So, yes, again, there are big numbers on -- it's one of those good things but it\u2019s lots of little things. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Peter Benedict - Robert Baird : Hey, Richard, couple of questions. First, just the membership promos you are doing with LivingSocial, how are those funded? Are the vendors contributing any of that or are you guys funding all that? Richard Galanti : Take an example of -- I think we are doing most of the funding of that. Certainly to the extent, there is identity protection. We have some vendor support, I\u2019m sure. I don't know exactly but I\u2019m sure we do. The other items, on the food items, there are items, the KS bath tissue, rotisserie chicken. I\u2019m not sure if there's a little support from the manufacturers but I would assume it\u2019s part of the member procurement costs on our side. Peter Benedict - Robert Baird : All right. Okay. And then the plans for the Canadian cash that you're bringing in? Richard Galanti : It\u2019s really just moving it down here. As we read about everyday in the paper, money is stuck at multinational companies outside of the U.S. We have the ability -- based on when the monies were earned over the last 20 years. Years ago, basically the marginal, federal, corporate tax rate in Canada versus U.S. was a lot closer than I think the roughly 13 percentage points difference now roughly 26% versus 39%. These first billion dollars, if you will, bring in $2 million I think I mentioned is translated into U.S. dollars, is at an effective rate of about 1.25% tax rate. So we opted to move it. Canada, of course is very profitable. It has its own column in the segment analysis. You can kind of figure that out. While we are still adding two or three units, our CapEx is dwarfed by our earnings up there and so we will continue to make money. And we saw this as an opportune time to be able to start that process. Peter Benedict - Robert Baird : Okay, perfect. And then last question just, how do you guys you think about the timing of introducing the executive membership option into new markets? What are the main considerations and how should we think about that for getting in some of these markets where you are not in? I\u2019m thinking of Asia. Richard Galanti : Yeah, I think there is two things. One is that how big is the country in terms of how many units we have. And secondly, can we get -- I guess there are three things. That was the first one. Second would be putting a menu of services together that we can do. And of course as we get bigger and a relatively bigger in a given country that buying power allows us to do that. And then what else we have going on in using Japan as an example, we've gone from what 9 to 23 or 24 units in about 2.5 years. So I think we like it, we like executive member program, and long-term we would like to see it another countries, but those are the types of factors. Peter Benedict - Robert Baird : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Mike Otway - Wolfe Research : Hey, good morning. This is actually Mike Otway in for Scott. Thanks for taking the questions. Richard, in terms of SG&A, you laid out the buckets. As we think about next year, is there any -- are there any buckets that are likely to move SG&A a bit higher than this year, or perhaps a little lower? I know you mentioned you are spending a bit more on IT modernization, how does that flow through the P&L? Any color there would be great. Richard Galanti : Well, I mean, first and foremost, it\u2019s sales growth. I mean, if we can get good sales growth, that helps a lot of things. Certainly, increased penetration in some of our overseas markets actually helps quite a bit, because of various things. The healthcare expenses as a percent of sales are much lower in virtually every other country than United States. Labor costs are different and generally lower in other countries as a percent of sales. So I think those things will probably help us. In terms of IT modernization, as I\u2019ve kind of laid out over the last couple of years each quarter, incrementally we would expect that to be in the low to mid -- low to low mid-teens incremental over a three or four years. I think we\u2019re probably up to 10 or 11 basis point or maybe 9 or 10 basis points over the last couple years and we will continue to see that this year. I don't think it's going to help us anytime soon. It probably is a slight negative impact certainly in fiscal \u201915, maybe a little in fiscal '16 before it flattens out and hopefully starts to go the other way a little bit. Beyond that, healthcare is always none known in the U.S. And again as I mentioned, I think to the extent that the healthcare continues to be the inflationary aspects of healthcare in the US. And as you know, we haven't done -- aren\u2019t going to make major changes, like sending a bunch of people out of it. That\u2019s an expensive cost to us and we\u2019re probably be able do that. Notwithstanding that, even if that continues in its slightly greater than sale, topline sales rate of growth, increasing penetration of healthcare costs outside of the U.S. will help mitigate any damage there. So I don't think there's anything new to add to this process, those kinds of things. Mike Otway - Wolfe Research : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just in terms of the consumer, have you seen any real change there in the last few months? And then specifically with your business in the Midwest and Southeast, maybe what you're seeing in those regions relative to it\u2019s clearly strong, what's going on there versus some other places in the country? Richard Galanti : Well, I think with Midwest, certainly it\u2019s a newer region relatively speaking. We are getting -- we seem to have I think hitting our sweet spots in some of those cities. Same in the Southeast, we\u2019ve opened in areas like Louisiana and Alabama and Georgia and Florida with some additional units and South Carolina. They are generally tending to do pretty well. So I think a few actually years there have helped us frankly. I can't tell you much more than that in terms of the little color on the consumer. Some of the usual suspects, good suspects if you will in terms of merchandise categories, some of the nonfoods, softlines and hardlines categories like apparel and housewares and domestics, those of all done well in part because of our commitment to them. Our increasing commitment of apparel area would be one example. Clearly having the demographic or member I think helps. Having strength in gas, I mean gas sales were up, I think I mentioned I think 4% -- notwithstanding -- 3% or 4%, notwithstanding 4% or so percent decline in average sales price per gallon. So gallons were up nicely and that\u2019s driving, no pun intended but driving people into the Costco parking lots. Mike Otway - Wolfe Research : Great. Thanks, Richard. Appreciate the color. Operator : Your next question is from Meredith Adler with Barclays. Meredith Adler - Barclays: Thanks for taking my question. I'd just like to talk a little bit about, as you think about international growth, I noticed that there's -- you didn\u2019t mention opening anything in France, I think in this coming year. Are you looking just to continue to fill out the markets where you already operate? Or are you considering moving into another new market, and obviously Spain is still very new but\u2026? Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, both Spain and France, I think we probably started talking about those two countries three years ago. And at the time, we felt that it could be three or more years based on the permitting and appeal processes and various not only countries, but cities and communities. And that\u2019s certainly why we keep at this point pushing out France, we will continue to look at that. And again, we will have our second opening in Spain later in calendar \u201915. We haven't mentioned any other countries beyond that. If I was a betting person, absolutely in the few years but not in the next year, year and half. Meredith Adler - Barclays: And maybe you could just comment a little bit about real estate in the U.S., are you finding any changes in the environments, harder to find locations, working with developers, anything different? Richard Galanti : Well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s anything different. In some of the markets, it becomes -- it\u2019s ever increase -- increasingly more difficult. In the greater LA where we've got 40 or 50 units, many, many units, we feel that over the next 10 years we could open another 10 or 15, but they are all very pinpointed locations based on where other locations, other Costco locations are, so it\u2019s -- and it\u2019s densely populated and it\u2019s difficult, but that's what we do. And we\u2019ve got a lot more people in the real estate area over the last few years, we\u2019ve got more in the pipeline and we think we\u2019ll get there. I think also in -- and we are fortunate of the sense that many of the markets, be it Texas, Midwest, Southeast, some of the markets that we are newer and over the last 10 years, not the last 30 years, we\u2019re able to go into. And again given our demographic, we\u2019re able to find some locations. Certainly, we also get some calls as you might expect from developers, but it's probably an increasingly difficult effort and that's why we've added more infrastructure to pursue that. Overseas every country is a little different. I think as I mentioned in Asia this coming year we have I think six plan 3, 2 and 1. Of course we\u2019ve opened a bunch in Japan in last two years already. And so again it takes a lot longer, but we\u2019ve got a lot in the pipeline too and so we will continue to see some growth there. Meredith Adler - Barclays: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Simon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Siber - Morgan Stanley : Good morning. It\u2019s Joshua Siber on for Simon Gutman. I am curious, if you guys are seeing areas of the store where customers are more or less sensitive to price increases and how much room you have to further pass-through greater costs in these categories? Richard Galanti : Well, we\u2019re most sensitive to us. We haven't seen any major change in level of competition out there, I mean everybody is tough and we\u2019re pretty tough ourselves. So I don't think so. I mean, I think, it\u2019s continuing as it goes. I think some of our margin improvement of late has become as we have not raised prices, but some of the underlying costs have come down and some of that hurt is behind us, but tomorrow is another day. Joshua Siber - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Sorry. Go ahead. Richard Galanti : The list of price increases is not a big list around here. Joshua Siber - Morgan Stanley : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Richard Galanti : Relatively speaking. Joshua Siber - Morgan Stanley : Sure. For the members that you picked up on LivingSocial, do these customers shop online more frequently and is there a noticeable difference in basket in terms of pricing or content? Richard Galanti : They are so new, I can\u2019t really tell you. This most recent program was early about three weeks ago and the process is they redeem their coupon, then they come in and a lot of them are coming in. But I would guess generally speaking compared to the first test we did on a regional basis within social a few months earlier, you do have a higher percentage of millennials. But by getting new member millennials or otherwise, when new member first starts to shop, they are generally shopping small basket sizes and a little bit more food-oriented to start with. And that\u2019s been historically a typical for -- a typically pattern. So, it\u2019s too early to tell. Joshua Siber - Morgan Stanley :  Okay. And then just one more housekeeping question. Is the $150 million buyback that you guys spent in fourth quarter a good run rate to go forward? Richard Galanti :  I can\u2019t really respond to that. I can tell you that we -- historically when we have bought back we have bought through blackout periods using 10b5-1s, our longest blackout period of the year which is six or seven weeks long, stretching from early -- I guess from late July, early August all the way to today. You have to basically put in place something. Well, if you go back that many weeks, the stock at the time was in the mid to high, 115 to 117. And so we hadn\u2019t bought for the last few weeks of the quarter, but that would imply a little longer, a bigger run rate, but it will go up and down a little bit. I think that we are intent on buying some stock back. Joshua Siber - Morgan Stanley :  Okay. Thanks for the color, guys. Operator :  Your next question is from David Schick with Stifel. David Schick - Stifel: Hi. Good morning. You talked in the call about the high-teens growth of online and you talked about the success of the Google partnership. And you said profit growth was I think at a similar pace. But going back to what you said; if you could just give any more details on how the profitability or the growth thereof is trending in online, that would be helpful. Thanks. Richard Galanti :  The profit was very good. I don\u2019t think we really give out profit growth numbers there and that 3% piece of our business. The good news, it\u2019s growing and it is more profitable. E-commerce is definitely quite a bit more profitable than the rest of the company. And so 3% of sales implies a greater percent increase of earnings. David Schick - Stifel: Is it more profitable on a flow-through basis than it was at this time last year? Richard Galanti :  Let me correct that, 3% of sales, a higher percent of sales profitability than the company overall. So every time we can grow those sales, you will see earnings grow nicely too. David Schick - Stifel: And then is the operating margin of it -- if you don\u2019t want to detail that, that's fine, but is it growing beyond the revenue, is it levering, or is it expanding the total loaded margin? Richard Galanti :  Well, the problem you\u2019ve is that we\u2019ve opened recently in a couple of new countries in the last year and half. And so we\u2019re spending a lot of money on that. We spent a lot money on apps upgrading. And so I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me, but I know it\u2019s growing and it\u2019s profitable. And we are continuing to pursue it. David Schick - Stifel: Thank you. Operator :  Your next question is from Greg Melich with ISI Group. Greg Melich - ISI Group :  Hi. Thanks, Richard. A couple questions. Love to start on membership fee income, so it was up 7%, what was it in local currencies? And in terms of membership growth, how much of that you think is driven by the new clubs? Richard Galanti :  Let me answer the first question. It was up 8% without FX and dollars. And what was the other question? Greg Melich - ISI Group : So I think you said memberships were up 7%. I was trying to get a sense of how much of that was driven by the new openings, particularly in these markets where you have been very successful and you've had huge membership growth with some of the new clubs. Richard Galanti :  I don\u2019t have it in front of me. I\u2019m sure that made it healthy. I can remember over the years when sometimes it\u2019s a little down year-over-year because a year ago we had some foreign operations with those outsized, new sign-ups and fewer international the next year. I don't know off the top of my head. Greg Melich - ISI Group :  All right. So use 8% as the local currency number? Richard Galanti : Yes. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Okay. And then second, I wanted to understand a little bit more about the gross margin in ancillary. I guess that was up -- you said up 50 bps in ancillary, which was 50? Richard Galanti : The ancillary, if you totaled ancillary gross margin divided by total ancillary business sales, it was up a little over 50 basis points. Different ancillary businesses were up or down differently, that in addition to strong sales in those areas. So the combination of increasing penetration and increasing margins was at a higher level benefit to the total company gross margin. Gas being the outsized one there. Greg Melich - ISI Group : How should we think about the sustainability of that on gas? Like, are we now at what would be a normal run rate there? And also is dot-com -- where does that show up in your nice little bridge you do? Richard Galanti : Well, dot-com is in the core. It\u2019s on percent\u2026 Greg Melich - ISI Group : Okay. That\u2019s the reason. Richard Galanti : Dot-com, no. In terms of sustainability of gas profits, I only wish. We\u2019ve probably been on a little longer run of good gas profitability the last several months. Generally speaking, when gas prices year-over-year are flat or declining as they are now that's good news. We save the customer more and we make more. When they are growing up fast, we save the company and the customer little less and we make it less. And so we've been blessed by having a positive run here for several months. But it\u2019s a volatile area. Now that\u2019s just looking with false blinds on just gas operation. That doesn\u2019t take into the account fact that every time we can get somebody to come in and get gas. That\u2019s incrementally a potential positive shop in the warehouse as well as and so that we of course don't consider is part of that. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Is it fair to say that the 15 bps that you cited that gas was half of that? I think you listed it first when you talked about optical and hearing aids and gas. Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t know off the top of my head. I bet it\u2019s half or more. It\u2019s not all. Greg Melich - ISI Group : Got it. And then lastly just on the inventory increase, it sounded like you gave those four areas which is all very clear. Was there anything unusual about that other than restocking Apple that you wouldn't use that as sort of a trend going forward in those categories? Richard Galanti : Actually, the trend -- this is, I think probably the lowest year-over-year average increase in merchandised inventories. For few years there, we've been running up 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% year-over-year in the inventory levels. In the last couple of quarters on a year-over-year basis, we've been down in the 2% or 3% range. So actually it\u2019s come in better in my view, I mean, 2%, whatever a 3% increase in inventories on a 2% increase in inventories on a 7%, or 8% or 9% increase in total sales. I think the anomaly there would be adding some product on that side and the anomaly, of course with inflation and fresh foods. But that\u2019s going to fluctuate as well. So, I think overall probably this is -- we looked at this as being a little bit better level of increase in average inventories per warehouse. Greg Melich - ISI Group : And it sounds like you think it's sustainable at this rate? Richard Galanti : At this point, are you sure? Greg Melich - ISI Group :  Yeah. Thanks a lot. Richard Galanti : That could change tomorrow. You never know. Greg Melich - ISI Group : I know. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question is from Mathew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Mathew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Thanks a lot and good morning. A couple of quick ones here. First of all, I know that you essentially mark-to-market for LIFO at the end of any given quarter or so. So your expectation is that you are probably going to be clean as you go into next year. That being said with the trends that you're seeing in pricing in key categories, what is your initial thinking on the direction that might move in 2015 relative to this past year? Richard Galanti : It\u2019s hard to know. The only person, I\u2019ve actually talk to is in the area of fresh foods and there's anticipation of continuing overall inflationary trend there. Although some of it, when it's deflationary, it\u2019s because -- I think butter had skyrocketed and now it\u2019s coming down a little. I might be wrong on the commodity there but probably still a little bit of inflation. Mathew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Okay. A quick second question here. You mentioned in your gross margin discussion that a hard line was down a bit year-on-year. Just interested in any color in terms of the drivers there? Richard Galanti :  Yeah. I think, for the quarter it was flat. Nothing really stood out. I mean, majors versus electronics was up slightly, nothing really stands out there. Mathew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Okay. And then finally, you had a question earlier about some of the membership deals that you are running, for example, the one with LivingSocial but really who bore the economic costs. I guess my question is, and I know that this is pretty small potatoes for the moment, how do you account for those subsidies? Does it reduce the membership fee income or does it show up in some other line item? Richard Galanti : It\u2019s allocated between sales and membership but it\u2019s mostly membership. Mathew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Okay. So for the year -- sorry go ahead. Richard Galanti : That\u2019s over the year. I mean, and it\u2019s amortized over the year. I will have to find out. I don\u2019t -- it's so small. It\u2019s less than a rounding error. Mathew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : Fair enough. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. Richard Galanti :  Is that it? Operator : Your next question comes from Charles Grom with Sterne Agee. Charles Grom - Sterne Agee : Thanks. Good morning, Richard. Nice quarter. Just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about Google Express and what\u2019s the ultimate goal of that program? Is it to drive increased memberships? Is it for you to get younger? And I guess what's holding you guys back on rolling it out to more than just the few regions where it's being tested today? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all we talk about us and Google partnering on this. They\u2019re partnering with a number of other retailers as well. You can go to Google Shopping Express in each of those three geographic markets and see about other retailers. We\u2019re certainly, I think a big component of it but we\u2019re big component of anything we do. And it\u2019s been good so far. I think you really have to ask them that. I would assume they are looking at additional markets but as they are announced, you\u2019ll find out as well. Generally speaking, ultimately, we always asked about all the concerns with delivery and e-commerce and all that stuff. And we recognize, we\u2019re not going to be the guy that drops off Fruity Pebbles cereal and a quarter milk before your kid wakes up in the morning for breakfast, if you ordered it before 10 p.m. a night before. But we started our business being a wholesale supplier. In this case, it\u2019s kind of hopefully a win-win, not only for Google Shopping Express but for us. We are seeing incremental business from it but there is -- again there is a lot of nuances to it, so far so good. But again, the biggest test it\u2019s been around for seven -- eight or nine months I guess, since January in the Bay Area and a lot fewer months in L.A. and New York. We like it because it\u2019s our member and there is net positive aspect of it. You can\u2019t get Costco items through Google Express unless you are a Costco member. And we have seen incremental signups because of that. And look, we appreciate the fact that it\u2019s a way to self merchandise, as well it\u2019s a way to get some members over time as well it\u2019s a great way in our view to have -- ultimately, we want to get you into the store or into warehouses more frequently also and we think there\u2019s avenues to do that. But it\u2019s really too early to know other than as its likely rolled out to other cities. We\u2019ll be part of that at this point in time. Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee: Okay. So another initiative you guys have is to get younger is this organic offering. I'm just wondering if you could just put things into context of where you guys are today, either number of SKUs or percentage of sales, to where you were a couple of years ago. Richard Galanti : Organic was about $3 billion I\u2019m told by one of the many people in my office right now last year and growing dramatically, a part of that supply and part of that\u2019s pushing it more. I don\u2019t think we said around the number of years ago and said let\u2019s do organic to get millennials. I think what happened is as we saw items and as those items grow and we see that it\u2019s got great attributes for us. Wonder we didn\u2019t even realize until we saw it. We can generally provide a better savings than others because other retailers sometimes will use it as an ability to get more margins and so it show greater savings. It\u2019s a higher price point item than the substitute item. And again the added benefit was as in some instances, I\u2019ve used the ground beef example. We had existing loyal members that 80%, I know in the first year assume it could be a little lower. Now but a large percentage of those were incremental sales because those were existing members that didn\u2019t buy their ground beef at Costco. So to the extent that you have, be it Millennial or otherwise but to the extent, you have somebody that is an organic buyer that may have left Costco but if we don\u2019t have an organic alternative, they go to shop elsewhere for that item. Now, so that helps unforgettably more frequently to Costco but we\u2019re doing it because we\u2019re selling those items. And as it increases -- we've had organic milk for a number of years and certainly we\u2019re able to use our buying power and our sourcing to continue to drive that. Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee: Okay. And just switching gears a little bit, it's been a while since I've heard you guys articulate a longer-term store goal. And I'm just wondering if you are willing to share one now. And as a follow-up to that, 19 clubs in the U.S this year out of, say, roughly 31. When does the pendulum shift to more international locations where you are doing 19 international, say, as opposed to 19 in the U.S. for this year? Richard Galanti : I think over the next five years. If you look that a year ago, I think, we talked about the fact that over a five-year period we\u2019d expect to open roughly 30 a year, maybe starting at 28 or 29 and after 33 or 35 and we\u2019re kind of in that. I guess, you\u2019re two or two and a half of that five years. I think the fact that we\u2019re opening a few more -- if you ask me four years ago, I would guess, it might be more evenly split right now. I think that\u2019s simply a function of availability and speed at which you get things done here. When you're looking at 20 million population city in Asia, there is all kinds of issues and again, as I\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve got more people in real estate on the ground in each of these countries compared to very few on the ground five years ago. So the pipeline is definitely more filled. And I guess, from -- looking at it in a positive way, I -- the question of, when do you going to slowdown in the U.S because of anticipated saturation, where -- I am happy to report that that\u2019s not happening yet. It will happen at some point, but if anything, it's probably that pendulum has probably swung the other way a little bit in the last couple years in part because some of the strength in those markets where we've been in 10 to 15 years or less not 25 and 30 years. Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee: Interesting. And any thought on a longer term store goal that you guys have? Richard Galanti : Other than more, I think, if you ask, Jeff and Craig and the heads of operations, if it were this current might, as I defined it five-year period, its 30 -- a little over 30-year. I think we like to get up to 35 a year in the next five years, maybe a little more. So we\u2019ll continue to try to push that a little bit and we feel we have the capabilities to do that that depends of course on continued success in these markets. Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee: Okay. And then the last question just on the margins as a follow-up to I believe Matt's question, just wondering if you could speak to the degree of improvement on food and sundries and fresh relative to the third quarter, which I believe your food and sundries was up 20 and then fresh was down a couple of basis points? I know you said it was positive, just wondering if you could give us the degree of improvement? Richard Galanti : I think it\u2019s in the -- I don\u2019t have it right in front of me, but it was less than up 50 and more than up 10, I don\u2019t have it in front of me. Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee: I\u2019m sorry, could you repeat that? Richard Galanti : Less than up 50 and more than up 10 basis points. Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee: Okay. Richard Galanti : I think, somewhere in the high teens or 20s, I don\u2019t -- I could be off a little bit, but there wasn\u2019t -- one of them wasn\u2019t up 1 basis point and the other up 80. They were both up. Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee: Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks again. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Exstein with Credit Suisse. Charlene Wong - Credit Suisse : Morning. It\u2019s Charlene Wong on for Michael Exstein. What\u2019s your initial experience in Spain been like? Richard Galanti : I\u2019m sorry. What was the question? Charlene Wong - Credit Suisse : What has your initial experience in Spain been like? Richard Galanti : Well, so far, it\u2019s fine. I mean, our member signups are strong and continuing. As we expect when we go into a completely new country, you generally see smaller baskets to start with. We haven't -- needless to say, we\u2019ve only been here for three or four months so we haven\u2019t anniversaried anything in terms of seeing any type of renewal rates. But we\u2019re pushing forward. We\u2019re working on our sites in Spain. So, no major differences of expectations. Charlene Wong - Credit Suisse : Got you. Thank you. Operator : And your final question comes from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities. Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities : Hi, Richard. Just got a couple of questions for you, though. On the fourth quarter what was the percentage of sales to the total and I'm not sure if you gave it, but can you talk a little bit about in September the impact on gas and FX were to the month of September sales? Richard Galanti : Yes. I can. Gas was, well, let\u2019s say, FX was 120 drag and gas was about 0.5 a point, just 48 basis points. Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities : Okay. Great. And then just the last question that I have is, on the openings for the next fiscal year, are you -- the timing of them, why are they so back-half weighted? Richard Galanti : Well, the biggest reason is, we try to open everything as soon as we can, other than when there's some craziness, because if it\u2019s up in Minnesota and its in the snow and the grounds frozen, you might lose four months and you can\u2019t get the foundation, the ground dug and the foundation set. But it's just timing of when they are. We would love to push a few of them sooner. That\u2019s generally our best guess of where they are. Its really, I mean, the impact is and I\u2019m sure by Q3 as we know more specifics about how many will open we will have a little color on pre-opening expense. But other than that it\u2019s a manageable process. Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : And there are no additional questions at this time. Richard Galanti : Well, thank you very much. And Bob and Jeff and I will be in the second day of our budget meeting for a couple hours but feel free to leave the message. We\u2019ll get back to you after noon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Morgan Kevin Heenan - Nomura Securities Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Mike Otway - Wolfe Research Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Greg Melich - Evercore Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group Operator : Good morning. My name is Erica, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. Mr. Galanti, you may begin your conference. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Erica. Good morning to everyone. This morning\u2019s press release reviews our first quarter fiscal 2015 operating results for the 12 weeks ended November 23rd. I\u2019ll start by stating that the discussions we are having include -- will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. To begin with, our first quarter operating results for the quarter as you saw we -- our reported earnings came in at a $1.12 a share, up 17%, or $0.16 per share over last year's first quarter earnings of $0.96 a share. Few items of note, in terms of looking at the comparison, within gross margin which was higher year-over-year in the first quarter by 22 basis points, we benefited from strong margins in our gasoline business, which I will speak to more when I discuss our gross margins results and we also had a $17 million pretax nonrecurring loss recovery. This latter $17 million amount represented about 6 basis points in margin improvement or about $0.03 to our per share earnings. Interest income and other, you note was higher year-over-year in the first quarter by $17 million pretax or about $0.03 a share. This increase primarily related to several of our foreign operations using FX contracts to lock in U.S. dollar denominated merchandise payables. Under GAAP, the mark-to-market gains or losses, in this case, of course, gains are recorded on the interest income and other income statement line. I really look at this is part of merchandising gross margin in the sense that our foreign operations -- our foreign operations buyers lock in exchange rates at prices -- at amount which they are comfortable they will be able to price their merchandise at. Third, FX, in the first quarter, as you probably are aware, the foreign currencies where we operate overall weakened versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in Canada and Japan, resulting in our foreign earnings in the first quarter, when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $22 million pretax or $0.03 a share than those earnings would have been had FX exchange rates been flat year-over-year. Fourth item, stock expense, that was higher year-over-year in the first quarter by $38 million or $0.06 a share. As I mentioned before, we have over 4,000 of our assistant managers and above, who receive restricted stock units as a significant part of their annual compensation. These grants are made annually each October or in the first fiscal quarter. These RSU grants then typically vest over a five-year period, with accelerated vesting when a recipient reaches 25, 30, and 35 years of employment with the company. Factors driving this increase included, of course, the appreciation of our stock price, additional levels of accelerated vesting given some employees\u2019 long tenure with the company and large number of employees in the plan. I should note that last past October, our RSU grants were reduced by an average of 15%. That is the number of RSUs granted to each recipient. Fifth, IT modernization costs, as discussed in each of the past eight or so fiscal quarter\u2019s earnings calls. Our major IT modernization efforts continue to negatively impact our SG&A expense percentages through \u201815 and into probably the first half of \u201916, especially as these new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In the first quarter, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs -- these incremental costs impacted SG&A by $12 million on estimated 3 basis points or $0.02 a share. Turning to our first quarter sales, in terms of the sales for the quarter, our 12-week reported comp sales figures for Q1 showed a 5% increase on a reported basis, 6% in the U.S. and 1% internationally. As indicated in our release, excluding gas price deflation and the impact of FX, the 6% U.S. would have been 7%, the 1% international would also have been 7% and therefore, the 5% for the total company reported on a normalized basis would have been 7%. And as reported last, Thursday, our November sales results for the four-week month ended November 30th, our comp sales increase, excluding again the impact of FX and gas were even a big stronger than these 12 weeks figures, with total company comps on that normalized basis increase of 8%, which included a 9% in the U.S. and 7% international ex gas and FX. Other topics of interest, our opening activities and plans, we opened eight new locations during the first quarter, which ended November 23rd, six in the U.S., our seventh location in Australia and our second location in Leone, Mexico. During the first quarter, we also relocated one location in Wayne, New Jersey to an expanded location. Also during the quarter we -- about six weeks prior we had experienced a severe hurricane in -- around our Campos and Lucas, Mexico location that has since been reopened. We have no openings plan for Q2, for all of fiscal \u201915 however, we have a current plan of 31 new locations, 18 of which will be in the U.S., three each in Japan and Mexico, two each in Australia and Korea, and one each in Canada, U.K. and Taiwan. Also this morning, I will review with you our e-commerce activities, our membership trends, additional discussion about gross margins and SG&A in the quarter, and just few other topics of interest. Now on to the discussion of our quarterly results, again sales, total sales were up 7.4% to $26.3 million. Again, on a comp basis, reported a 5, ex gas and FX it would have been a 7. For the quarter, our reported [five] [ph] comp was a combination of an average transaction size of just over flat for the quarter, ex gas and FX it would have been up about 2.5% and average frequency increase of about 4.5% in the quarter. In terms of comparisons by geographic region, geographically for the quarter, at the Midwest and Southeast were the strongest with Northeast close behind. Internationally in local currencies, the better performing countries were Canada, Taiwan and Mexico. In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, for the first quarter within food and sundries which was up in the mid-single digits. Candy, deli and spirits were up with the relative standouts. Within hardlines, there were also up in the mid-single digits for the quarter. Majors are electronics, came in positive for quarter actually in the high-single digits range. In addition, better performing departments within hardlines was a hardware, sporting goods and tires. Within mid single-digit softlines, domestic, apparel and home furnishings were the standouts and fresh foods, where our comps were in the high singles, with meat department being the standout there. Moving to line items in the income statement, the first quarter, membership fees, were up 6% or $33 million to $582 million. That was about -- even the sales strength that was about 3 basis points decline. Again, ex-FX at 6% dollar increase, if assuming flat year-over-year FX would have been up 8%. In terms of membership, we continue to benefit from strong signups at existing and new warehouses, continued increase in penetration of the executive member and strong renewal rates both in the U.S. and Canada, as well as worldwide in newer markets. Our new membership signups in Q1 year-over-year companywide were up 4% year-over-year in the quarter. You know, there were fewer locations opened. We opened nine locations in Q1 this year versus 13 last year. But that, of course, includes all member signups, new member signups throughout the company. In terms of new number of members at Q1 end, we began the fiscal year or ended last fiscal year with 31.6 million Gold Star members. We now had this quarter end 32.1 million, so up about 0.5 million. Primary business remained at 6.9 million, Add On Business remains at 3.5. So all told, we went from 42 million member households to 42.5 million and including additional card -- cardholders went from 76.4 million in fiscal year end to 77.5 million at the end of the first quarter. Also at Q1 end, paid executive memberships totaled 15.2 million, which was an increase during the 12 weeks of about 420,000 or about 35,000 a week increase in the quarter. Executive members as you know represent more than a third of our membership base and over two thirds of our sales operation. In terms of renewal rates, they continued to be strong. At the end of the fourth quarter business memberships renewed at 94.4 at Q1 \u201915, so 12 weeks later 94.5 up a tick, Gold Star remained at 89.8, total 90.6 at fiscal year end and 90.7 at Q1 end and when I say total, that\u2019s U.S. and Canada, recognizing newer markets start out lower rates and build over the first several years. Worldwide we remained at 87.3% in the fourth quarter and at Q1 end still a nice increase from year earlier at the end of the first quarter last year at 87.3 that we ended the quarter with now was 86.5 worldwide. As I touched on last quarter\u2019s conference call, we continue to try new things to drive sales and members, membership signups. I did mentioned in this fiscal quarter, but I -- on the last call in early September for eight days we ran a nationwide promotion for new members on LivingSocial. It was a good value and we felt worked pretty well, but we will continue to look and see what we want to do going forward, no plans at this point. Going on to the gross margin line, gross margins as you saw were quite strong up 22 basis points to 11.03%. Again, I'll ask you to jot down a few numbers, well, our four columns, the first two columns are for the entire fiscal year \u201914, both reported and without gas deflation and then first quarter \u201815 would be columns three and four reported and without gas deflation. Moving across those lines -- those columns, core merchandise for the year was up 6 basis points on a reported basis and up 3 ex gas deflation. For the quarter, it was down 6 basis points and down 13 without gas deflation. Ancillary, plus 6 and plus 6 in columns one and two for all of last fiscal year. In Q1 \u201815 reported plus 22 and without gas deflation plus 20. 2% reward, minus 1s across the four columns. LIFO year-over-year and for the -- for all of last fiscal year was a minus 5 and a minus 5, we actually had a very small LIFO credit this year versus a very small LIFO charge last year in the quarter, so it\u2019s a plus 1 and a plus 1. Lastly, other adjustments, minus 2 and minus 2 in all of fiscal \u201814 and plus 6 and plus 7 without gas deflation for Q1, that's that one-time, that nonrecurring lawsuit recovery as I mentioned earlier. So total reported was up 22 and for the quarter and up 14 without gas deflation. Now the core merchandise I mentioned is, on a reported basis was down 6 and down 13 ex gas, a lot of that again is driven by this -- particular the success in the gas business both in volume, as well as margin contribution, where gas margins were up when gas prices will go down typically. Core gross margins as a percent of their own sales were slightly negative, a couple basis points down year-over-year, with food and sundries and softlines -- and softlines showing year-over-year improvement, and hardlines and fresh foods gross margins being lower year-over-year in the quarter, pretty much as what we planned -- what we continue to see in the fresh foods area with some of the raw material costs going up. Ancillary and other business gross margins, as I mentioned, was up 22 or up 20 without gas deflation. With the exception of pharm -- slightly lower -- lower year-over-year pharmacy margins, most of the other ancillary businesses starting with gasoline, of course, but optical, hearing aid, travel business centers all showed higher margins year-over-year in the quarter. 2% reward, again increasing penetration represented a basis point hit to margin and as I mentioned, LIFO was a 1 basis point swing, we had a $1 million LIFO charge last year in the quarter and a small LIFO credit of about $2 billion this year. Moving into SG&A, our SG&A percentage year-over-year in the quarter was higher by 5 -- by 4 basis points coming in at 10.26 this year compared with a 10.22 last year in the quarter. Again, we'll do the same four columns for all of fiscal \u201814 both reported and without gas deflation. Columns three and four first quarter both reported and without gas deflation. Going across these line items, operations were a minus 2 and a plus 1 for the year and a plus 8 and plus 16 for the quarter. Remember pluses means lower year-over-year SG&A. Central, minus 3 and minus 3 in the year and minus 1 and minus 1 in the quarter. Stock compensation minus 2 and minus 2 for the year and minus 11 and minus 11 for the quarter and total would be again for reported for all of fiscal \u201914 SG&A was higher year-over-year by 7 basis points, without gas deflation higher by 4, this year in the first quarter it was higher by 4 reported and better or lower by 4 without gas deflation. And little elaboration on this, core operations SG&A again was lower by 8, but lower by 16 ex gas impact. Within operations without gas our payroll SG&A percentage was 9 basis points better year-over-year, particularly good showing and certainly a reflection of a strong sales, as well as strong gas sales which have lower SG&A. While benefits to workers comp related expenses were about 4 basis points worse year-over-year. Central expense was slightly higher year-over-year in the quarter by a basis point, increase IT spending is, we continue to monetize, as I mentioned, within this number that was about 3 minus -- minus 3 basis points and that will continue in those types of increments we think. The increase was partially offset, of course, by improved payroll in central, as well as by 2 basis points. Finally, SG&A expense related to stock compensation was higher year-over-year by 11. I should point out that the year-over-year basis points variances for the six months item will be quite a bit less in Qs 2 and 3, and higher year-over-year in Q4, but not as big negative as variances we've seen in Q1. Again, if you think about it, with most of the option -- most of the RSUs vesting over five years, you take out the one that -- finally vested, so you take out the expense back when the stock was in the 50s and you add one when the stock was in the 125, 130s when we did that one in October this year. All told, hold on, here, last thing, on the income statement pre-opening expense, $24 million last year, it was lower or better improvement by 15 -- by 9 million or 15 million this year. Again, we opened nine units this year compared to 13 last year. So all told, reported operating income for the quarter totaled $668 million last year and $770 million this year, an increase of 15% or up $102 million in the quarter. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was about the same year-over-year with Q1 \u201815 coming in at $26 million versus $27 million last year in the quarter. Interest income and others I mentioned earlier was quite a bit higher year-over-year, $18 million last year versus $35 million this year, up $17 million. Actual interest income reported for the quarter was slightly up, I think it was little less than a $1 million. The other component of equity earnings within this line item was higher by 16. This again relates to this marking to market gains on FX contracts used to -- used to source U.S. merchandise in our U.S. -- principally our U.S. merchandise in our international operations. Overall pretax income was up 18% versus last year\u2019s quarter from $659 million last year to $779 million this year. In terms of tax rates, our effective tax rate this quarter came in a little higher than last year. It came in at a 35.2% compared to last year\u2019s first quarter rate of 34.6%. The decrease is mostly due do to a few net discrete items that benefited last year by about $5 million and a couple of a negative discrete items, which totaled about an increase in the taxes of about $1 million this year. Overall net income was up 17% versus last year\u2019s first quarter from $425 million last year to $486 million this year. Quick rundown on couple of other topics. Balance sheet, depreciation and amortization for the quarter came in at $254 million. In terms of accounts payables as a percent of inventories, you have the balance sheet attached to press release. Now, on that, it showed a reported number this year of 101% payables to inventories, up about two percentage points from 99% last year. That of course includes construction payables and other payables not just merchandise. We took up everything and just said merchandise payables as percent of inventory. Last year in Q1, it was 89%, up three percentage points to 92% this year. Again I think, a reflection of good inventory control but also strong sales. Average inventory per warehouse last year in the first quarter ended at $14,453,000. This year came in slightly lower at 14,372,000 about $81,000 lower. If you take out FX, FX was about a minus 250 -- $250,000 to that number. So if you take out FX, we are actually up average inventory per warehouse of about $169 million, still a very small increase of 1.2% on that normalized basis compared to the 7 plus percent sales increase. No real issues with inventory levels going into last few weeks before calendar year and Christmas for the holidays. They are in good shape. In the past couple of months, we have received questions about possible inventory issues due to the work slowdowns and shipping along the West Coast. I\u2019m sure like many retailers, we did what we always do to bring in seasonal merchandise a little earlier if required and necessary. Overall it was not a big issue for November and December and it\u2019s not currently a big issue. Looking ahead into January and February, it's really not a big issue, perhaps even a small issue from seasonal furniture and some other types of items like that and talking to the merchants, not big delays but a little bit of a backup. In terms of CapEx, first quarter \u201815, we spent $555 million. Our fiscal \u201815 CapEx is estimated to be in the $2.5 billion plus range. This compares to last year\u2019s $2 billion. So, up pretty significantly year-over-year with our ramp up and expansion. All the complementary things that go along with that, with depot expansion, and of course, the IT expenses that I had just mentioned as well. In terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend of 0.355 a share or $1.42 annualized. Based on shares outstanding is about $625 million annually. We did buy a little stock back in Q1 about $18 million at an average price of $126.43. And the first, I believe, five weeks of this quarter we were under blackout from the prior year with -- until we were able to report first quarter and so we didn\u2019t buy heck of a lot during the quarter. Costco Online, we\u2019re now in four countries, U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico. For the quarter, sales and profit were up over the year. E-commerce sales were up 20%, up 19% on a comp basis and up 21% excluding FX. A rep stores represents about 3% of our total sales, just under 3%. We continue to -- from really going back couple of years ago, where we platform decide, we\u2019ve gone through a couple of iterations of improving our mobile applications as I think I mentioned earlier. We\u2019ve combined some of our e-commerce merchandise efforts with our inline efforts. We think that\u2019s been a big help to us. We\u2019ve added a few categories like apparel, health and beauty aids and few extra Kirkland signature items. We've certainly improved timing of shipments by shipping what we ship directly instead of from the manufacturer from one depot to a few depots around the country. Our international markets, stay tuned, maybe one additional country by fiscal year end \u201815, certainly lease one by the end of calendar \u201815. In terms of a few other things that we talked about in the past, Google Shopping experience -- Express is now being offered in six markets in the U.S. Bay Area, which is recent -- now geographically expanded from its initial testing 10 months ago. The Los Angeles area, New York City, Manhattan and more recently in October, the test continued into three new cities, Chicago, DC and Boston. Again, it\u2019s too early to completely tell but we're seeing some increased overall spend and it\u2019s been a good partner to work with Google. We continue to increase our offerings and categories in these tests as well. Instacart, it\u2019s now in 13 markets. This is where customer in this cart order through its cart. They come in and buy merchandise and deliver it to the customer. That\u2019s needed to expand as well and boxed as now in three markets, I think, up from two. Lastly, I think you saw the release, maybe we talked about it with Ali Baba team all in being shipped out of our Taiwan operations. We\u2019re shipping -- I think we\u2019re up to about 125, 130 items, mostly various food or sundries or harbor related items, about half our [indiscernible] Signature. It's great but it's new and we\u2019ll see where it goes from here but certainly get our name noted a little bit over there as well. In terms of expansion, as I mentioned, we\u2019ve got a lot going -- nothing going on in Q2, just a few in Q3. We have five openings, although two of them are relocation. So, net of three. And we\u2019ve got 20 plan for the 16-week fourth quarter. Most of those look pretty good at this point. It\u2019s just how they -- the timing of them. In fiscal \u201814, for all the fiscal \u201814, which ended of course at the end of August, we added 29 units or about 5% unit square footage growth. In \u201815, assuming we add the 30 to 31 units on a base of 663, we would -- that would also be about 5% square footage growth. If we get to 31, it will be 18 in the U.S., three each in Japan and Mexico, two each in Australia and Korea and one each in Canada, U.K. and Taiwan. So U.S. for square footage numbers at Q1 end total square footage stood at 96,437,000 square feet. With that, I\u2019m going to turn it back over to Erica for any questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So Rich, I want to drill on a little bit on growth by category. So two were up, two were down, the two that were down are some fresh food and hard line. Fresh food was solely passthrough of inflation and was hard line\u2019s entirely mix? Richard Galanti : Fresh food was certainly inflation in U.S. holding prices, like you know, we do. Things I know again soundbite anecdotal. Butter and milk is way up and so -- therefore cheese. And so you\u2019ve got those types of items. On the other side, some of it\u2019s electronics, that's more competitive and we\u2019re part of that. And so a little of it is mix but \u2026. John Heinbockel : Yeah. Richard Galanti : \u2026in our view, nothing really has the ordinary. John Heinbockel : And then when you look at the two that were up and I think they were not up a lot, is that solely mix and where is Kirkland, I guess, Kirkland would have the big impact in food and sundries. That\u2019s what would show up. Is that primarily driving the better mix? Richard Galanti : Honestly, I don\u2019t have that level of detail in front of me. I\u2019m looking -- first of all, none of the ups or downs were -- they were in the 10 to 25 basis point range, basically up or down. So not a lot of jumping either way. So my guess is a little of its mix. KS helps but clearly KS, the big penetration increase of KS from 0 to 25% over the last high teens are 20 years. Those increments are smaller now. And so -- yes, it helps but it doesn\u2019t help like the days when you're adding a percentage point or two in a year sometimes. John Heinbockel : All right. Then, lastly on -- you talked about FX and inventory, even putting that aside, obviously inventory is under awfully good control, is that -- is more of that in-store or is more of that sort of backstage between your vendor in the stores? Richard Galanti : Keep in mind, if we are turning our inventories 12 plus times a year, everything is pretty fast paced. If you are in Canada or Japan or wherever, and you're buying -- buyers using FX contracts because they\u2019ve got, in most cases, U.S. dollar denominated inventory payables. They are going to lock-in based on what they got coming in, what they know if they are going to have pay out in dollars. And at time when they are comfortable with -- based on that conversion rate, they are comfortable with the price where they are going to sell in their local currency in their local country. So it\u2019s pretty straightforward. In fairness, as you know, it\u2019s some quarters year-over-year, some quarters it\u2019s a $10 million gain, some times it\u2019s $10 million loss. This time, it was a little better. I think partly a reflection of the weakness and the strength in the dollar, how quickly that's strengthened it, particularly in a couple of countries. John Heinbockel : It\u2019s nothing you are doing structurally -- although there is nothing you are doing structurally to take inventory working capital out of the system? Richard Galanti : No. I mean, we do that -- I mean, that\u2019s just kind of one of the mantras that we try to do anyway. Mind you, I mean, this is an example from gosh, 20 years ago in the tobacco business which is a very high volume, not as high one is used to be but a very high volume business, a very fast turning business. A number of years ago, the big -- the majors offered -- let's say whatever the terms were, x percent discount, if paid within seven days. And then they came back and said, we\u2019ll give you an extra half a point, if you pay one day EFT or ACH or whatever, it was. So 0.5% for paying six days early. It\u2019s no brainer, but you take a high volume item like that. And it goes from a lot of -- probably 100% payable to 0 almost. So I mean, that\u2019s an extreme example. You\u2019ve got gas working the other way where accounts payable is probably 600% or 700%. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Siber : Good morning. This is Joshua Siber on for Simon Gutman. Just curious looking back how our customers reacting to lower gasoline prices and have you seen any trade up from regular to premium? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t know -- I think we saw more premium anyway but I don\u2019t know that at the top of my head. I think the reflection that our shopping frequency in our concept continues strong. It is probably a reflection of that. Our view historically has been on something big like this whether it was -- gas was going crazy upward towards $4 a gallon in early to mid \u201808. Did it impact us? It probably impacts a little bit but not as much as some of the dollar type stores or lower demographic stores. We -- similarly, we get a little benefit from it, yes but we don\u2019t think it's big either way for us. Joshua Siber : Okay, so\u2026. Richard Galanti : It\u2019s got to be helpful. Joshua Siber : Sorry, what was that? Richard Galanti : It\u2019s got to help a little. Joshua Siber : Okay. And then looking forward, if gasoline stays where it\u2019s at right now, is there a change in profitability or have we seen the most of it in Q1? Richard Galanti : Well, I\u2019ll say what I know. I mean, this is a volatile business as we know. Generally speaking, when it\u2019s declining, it\u2019s the best in terms of profitability. It is more profitable at any level than it used to be a little bit. I think a part of that and again, we -- so it\u2019s a profitable business. It's a lower percent of sales, profitability than the company as a whole. I think one thing that\u2019s encouraging for us though is, it\u2019s more and more people coming to get their gas. For those that come in this, we\u2019ve heard a people that shop -- that pump gas during opening hours, a little over 50 of them now come in and shop. And so even if one or two of those 50 are incremental, that\u2019s a positive. We\u2019ve been helped two years in a row now with these outside entities like gasplay.com where nationwide on average, we are the lowest priced. That\u2019s helped. I know, our gallon comps in the first quarter were low single digits, which is really off the charge in terms of getting people into our parking lot, that's good. Joshua Siber : Okay. Again, if you don\u2019t mind, if I could add just one more, if you could discuss, has there been a mentality or strategic shift on e-commerce front. If you feel you\u2019ve gotten more aggressive over the past 6 to 12 months? Richard Galanti : I think the things that I mentioned is probably been over the past 6 to 18 or 24 month but certainly we -- we've added a few SKUs, expanded some categories, trying to get people to think of it, not just as the place that I can buy patio furniture or big TV but also some regular higher velocity items. And yes, nothing, I think has been more, if you look -- if I just looked at year-over-year sales increases on a comp basis, it wasn't a couple of years ago. It was kind of in the mid-single -- stuck in the mid single digits and last year, it was in the high teens and this quarter, it continues in that very high teen, low 20. So I think that\u2019s a reflection of the things that we've done but nothing new and dramatic in the last six months continuation of that. Joshua Siber : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee. Charles Grom : Good morning, Richard. Just to clarify on the gross margin grade, did you say that x gas, the quarter was down 13 basis points? Richard Galanti : The quarter is down but again, it\u2019s also like -- it's under the phrase, no good deed goes unpunished as over the years as I\u2019ve tried to explain this in a little matrix. You almost need a three-dimensional matrix given the gas was strong and gas gross margins were very strong relative to the very low gross margin business. That disproportionately rates those two lines in that little matrix such that -- and that's why I pointed out if you could adjust food and sundries, hard lines, soft lines and fresh foods, those four core areas, which, gosh, are better 80 plus percent of our business. Those were year-over-year were down two basis points, two of those sub departments up, 10 to 25 basis points, two of them down 10 to 25 basis points. So the core business is pretty much flat year-over-year. But it shows in that chart that way because they had higher dollar penetration of gas. Charles Grom : Okay. So the up two basis points were more or less compared to, say, that up six or seven basis points that you posted in the third and fourth quarter? Richard Galanti : Yeah. But it was down two and not upside. Charles Grom : I\u2019m sorry, down 2. Yeah, okay. Okay, I got it. And then on a CapEx guidance, you had a big acceleration from this year versus last year, yet store growth was pretty consistent. Just wondering if you could speak to the delta, is it IT spend, is it land or just what's driving the increase? Richard Galanti : Well. It\u2019s also former locations including relos. I think it\u2019s probably at least a 100 of it. International was more expensive. We probably are spending more this year on depot type stuff. All I\u2019m rounding here but depots, I bet year-over-year is 100, 150 higher. So it\u2019s probably -- but year-over-year in the prior year, there was probably 75 to 100 in IT and excluding from the leap year. But the big things are in. Certainly for the year, that 25 to 26 number, we have an original budget probably a little higher than that. But we know that a couple of them flip and so that assumes land baking for the first part of next year. But clearly we are spending more on some of these international locations in a confident way frankly. I mean, some of the ones in Asia as you know not coming with so far have been relatively no-brainers. Charles Grom : Okay. Just last question on the balance sheet. Roughly, $70 per share in cash, any updated thoughts on and getting a little bit more systematic on the buyback from doing so much each quarter, so much each year as opposed to setting up the grid and any thoughts on the current dividend 1% yield is lot lower than some of your consumer stable peers? Richard Galanti : Yeah. Our Board discusses it in every quarterly Board Meeting. Again, I guess I learned that the metrics works when stocks move slowly in either direction. We have had that high-quality problem that we put the makers in place and then in some cases, we are locked in for five or six weeks due to blackout, and then it moves well above several dollars of accretion we gave it. I think we want to be more systematic, but I can\u2019t say when it will be. We will talk to you next quarter but certainly, given that we grant to these 40, 200 or 300 employees annual grants that are just in the high threes, the 3.8 million shares or something. We want to at least come to that, I think on an ongoing basis and we certainly did not do that on a quarterly basis this quarter. But the year is still young and we will see. We will let you know next quarter. Charles Grom : All right. Thanks a lot. Good luck. Richard Galanti : As it relates to the dividend, again, that\u2019s the conversation we continue to have and we look at all. And we recognize that as first priority is CapEx and then tied for second, if you will or few other things that we\u2019ll continue to look at. I\u2019m sure we will just do things over time but beyond a timetable that we feel comfortable. Charles Grom : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter. A couple of questions. I mean, first off on gross margins. If you look at that, you may have discussed in the prepared remarks, I apologize. But the ancillary gross margin benefit you saw in, beginning here in Q1, can you just discussed the drivers of that and how should we think about coming to sustainability of that over the next two quarters? Richard Galanti : Well, I mean, the bigger hurdle was gas. As I mentioned, I think five or six, or five or seven, or six or seven of our ancillary businesses all had up year-over-year gross margins. Most particularly was gas. And so is that sustainable? No. It\u2019s never sustainable. You see where gas prices are now, so it's continuing. But again that could be fleeting and we have been asked the question. Well, when you get these outsized profits, are you more aggressive in pricing? We don\u2019t sit down and say let's use this many dollars but certainly we are going to be aggressive and that\u2019s what we do for living. So, I think that buffers a little bit as well. Brian Nagel : It\u2019s actually goes in my next question. I think, Richard, you already answered it. In the marketplace, if we look at Costco gas right now, I know from a competitive standpoint Costco gas versus competitors, you typically price below. You are saying that -- when prices are doing what they\u2019ve done, you essentially kept the competitive relationship the same in various markets. Richard Galanti : We\u2019ve improved the competitive relationship in our minds. Brian Nagel : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies. Dan Binder : Hi. It\u2019s Dan Binder. Congrats on a good quarter. Just want to follow-up on the gas discussion, with all the movement in the gallon comps and the pricing, where are we now as a percentage of sales for gas? Richard Galanti : I\u2019ll have somebody calculate it right now for you. Hold on a second. Dan Binder : Okay. My other question, if you want to focus on that, first, is on consumer electronics. You talked to a lot of strength there. Any color you can give us around, sort of the breadth of that strength, where you are seeing it, what you are seeing with 4K TV and competitive pricing? Richard Galanti : First of all, as you know, we introduced several Apple products over the last year. That's a very competitive business for retailers and for us as well. We know that. But we won\u2019t have that product for our members. 4K TVs are going well. I believe that on those higher end TVs, we tend to be the outlier in terms of driving sales of those. But it is still small relative to the entire category of that component. Phone business is very strong. You\u2019ve seen what we've done with our kiosks out there and not only phone businesses have been strong, added to that, we've added the Apple brand there as well. And then the various tablets. So there's a lot of different things in that area that are helping the sales strength. Again, I think it tends to be a little more competitive. Apple is part of that. That\u2019s pretty much it. Nothing out of the ordinary, I mean, these things fluctuate up and down a little bit. We are pleased of the strength of the comps in that area. Dan Binder : And then\u2026 Richard Galanti : By the way, in terms of the question about gas penetration, for the quarter it was about 10.5%. Dan Binder : 10.5%. And just a quick question on the cannibalization rate. I know it hasn\u2019t really changed much. I think it was like 50 basis points in any given month on the comp. I was just curious. Can you give us an idea of what you're seeing on the bounce back of those clubs once you cannibalize it? Does it come back to sort of historical volumes within year, two years, has that been changing at all as you\u2019ve been doing more fill-ins? Richard Galanti : Generally, it\u2019s a year or maybe slightly over a year. I mean, generally when we open it, when we cannibalize our own units, you might take anywhere as much as 10% or 15% from nearby unit or units. And a year, a year and a half later you are pretty much back. Going forward, not looking back the past year of course. And again, it varies but overall it's been pretty unpredictable for us. Based on zip code analysis and where the members are shopping from, we generally know. And what we find is the benefit really is, when we pick up a few extra members yes, not a lot where we pick up a lot of frequency. If you have a loyal member that\u2019s shopping and making these numbers up once a month because they are a 30 minute drive away from a Costco and all of a sudden, they are 10 minute driveway and it becomes a significantly more regular shopping frequency. Dan Binder : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Meredith Adler : It\u2019s Meredith Adler. I was wondering -- I\u2019m still somewhat new to the Costco story. If you could talk about where you see the most potential growth? Obviously, you don\u2019t have a lot of locations in Continental Europe and yet it\u2019s tough to get open warehouses there. When you look at Asia, do you feel like you\u2019ve still got a lot more growth in those markets and what about the U.S.? Richard Galanti : Well, if you had asked me five years ago, where we would expect to be now, I would say our goal is to get up to about 30 locations a year by this time and probably, we be right to that middle point of trending from majority in the U.S. to less than half in the U.S. If you look at this year next, it\u2019s 30 -- roughly 30 a year, still a little over half in the U.S. I think 16 or so last year and I think I mentioned 18 out of 31 this year. So, that's by the way a function that we\u2019ve continued to be successful and while we will still get another unit opened in the Puget Sound or perhaps in the Portland area one day or hopefully, every year or two, we get another LA unit in the Greater LA market of 45 or 50 units. But their precision points now where locations where we need to go. But we are finding in a lot of these cities and markets like Baton Rouge, New Orleans last year. So that's probably upped our expectation a little bit about our opportunities here in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we've got 10 or 11, I believe in each of Korea and Taiwan, maybe 12. And we think that we can go into the mid-to-high 20s there over time. But, again, it takes some time to get done and where. Japan is certainly a bigger market for us. We\u2019ve got 23, I believe, 22 or 23. We should have a lot more than that. But we went from 9 to 21 or something in little over two years. So we are doing well there. And we just -- as I mentioned, opened our seventh in Australia. While Australia is what two-thirds of the size population wise as Canada, where we have 90 or so units, we have seven in Australia. I'm not suggesting we are going to have 45 in Australia anytime soon. But certainly we will get more than seven. Western Europe, all of Europe is certainly an opportunity for us. It is tough to get in even in the worst of economies where we have been successful with about four years of effort getting one unit opened in Spain, with the second coming towards the middle to the end of next calendar year. And we still finally get our first unit opened in France. So it takes some time but we are persistent and we will be around. Meredith Adler : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair. Mark Miller : Hi. Good morning. A slightly different question on gas prices and my historical recollection is that when gas prices were high, more consumers might go out of their way to drive to Costco and then that was viewed as a historical benefit to traffic. But the inverse does not appear to be happening and so I\u2019m wondering what in your view has changed or I mean, do you think there is a risk of gas prices stay lower that you may not get quite as much a lift in terms of traffic to the stores as in the past? Richard Galanti : You are skyrocketing back in \u201908, going up towards $4 for the first time. We are on news every night somewhere, whether it\u2019s a small-town in Montana or Los Angeles and where is the best place for my guests. So that\u2019s certainly was a positive. Theoretically, oil amazes the people, as prices fall, that will be less of an incentive. I think it's a greater -- that membership value proposition. When a gas play.com comes ounces $40 plus million inputs from customer, from drivers out there saying that we are the best lowest price nationally by $0.14 or $0.16 that resonates. The fresh foods, second to none in our view were biased but that drives a lot of business. The pharmacy, frankly, I think deserved credit. We get through that in terms of pricing. So the fact that we -- we are proud of fact that we take care of our employees. All those things are positives. I think once you've come to Costco for gas and we got you into the warehouse, there is reasons why you are going to come back. And I think we're starting to appreciate the fact that it is all of the above. It\u2019s some of the crazy KS items that are KS items where you\u2019ve got the money, you got to buy them at Costco. Although there are few other places now you can buy them, but we are selling into those people. Mark Miller : Your traffic just continues to amaze. My other question is on China and so, I understand it\u2019s very early with Alibaba. But I want to ask is there any change in your long-term thinking on China? You did say that there is a benefit of getting your name known there. I mean, historically, you\u2019ve had some reservations but are you -- should we be thinking that comp growth is in the future there and what might inform that? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Yeah. I think it\u2019s in the future. But if you had asked me that same question 10 years ago, I would say I think it's in the future. And not being acute about it, every couple three years, Senior Management, both international Senior Management and it is a giant market. We are confident about what we do. We are also very hands-on and we got a lot of things going on in a lot of directions and we kind of know. We know that the anticipation is somebody is getting their first. Well, people go out in other places first and when we will come in, we will do just fine. So it will be at some point. I don't know when, if you said -- in most likelihood in the next 5 to 10 years, sure. Next two to five years, maybe. Next Thursday, we are not ready yet. Mark Miller : Okay. All right. Thanks Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning. So, I want to follow-up on the acceleration in the core comps over the past year. It seems like most of the acceleration is seen in the hardlines category. So would you agree with that, or has there been movements toward the high-end of the ranges that you provide in softlines and fresh foods and so forth? And within CE, is that TV turning positive, plus the addition of Apple driving the hardlines rebound? Richard Galanti : Well, that's one of the things I think I mentioned. Tires have been good this year. Automotive, lawn and garden have been good and we have season for that now. Apparel has continued to be strong and we enjoyed a couple of years on a compounded basis. Apparel comps saw increases in the mid-to-high teens. So that of course at some point has got to come down a little bit, but the organic is helping. I think in the last two years, we've little more than doubled organic sales from the low billions to closing in on $3 billion currently. And so that\u2019s -- all those things help. Chris Horvers : So within the hardlines category, is that TV and Apples, essentially that\u2019s driven that acceleration within the major sort of\u2026? Richard Galanti : I will say TV and Apple are probably the top two without looking at the detail. Phones are probably in there too. Phone could be first or second for us. I mean, phones are first but phones, TV and the reintroduction of some of the Apple items. Chris Horvers : And when you didn't sell, let\u2019s say iPads, were you selling iPhones in the wireless kiosks? Richard Galanti : Yes. Chris Horvers : Okay. Richard Galanti : We are. By the way as comment was made here in my office, those are the big volume categories. But white goods are up. Now that we do a big white goods business, audio is up. Again, smaller business but we -- and that\u2019s not just headphones, it\u2019s the sound systems and all kinds of stuff. But the big volume areas are those three that I mentioned. Chris Horvers : And was Apple sort of a point in time add back to the store base overall? Or did that start in let\u2019s say June and then ramp up over the past five months? Richard Galanti : I think that's right. But it's a piece of it. It\u2019s not the driving piece. Chris Horvers : Understood. Understood. Yeah. And then on depreciation, can you give us some color how to think about the depreciation? I know you -- I don\u2019t believe you historically guide to it, but with the incremental CapEx over the past couple years it would seem like dollars per week or dollars per quarter that will continue to arise for, I think the next couple years and so any color there? Richard Galanti : Yeah. I hope it continues to rise forever. Probably, the simplest way to do it is look at what is done for each of the last several years, year-over-year in dollars. My guess it\u2019s somewhere around 10%ish and that's probably as good a guess. Maybe, if you want to add a little bit to it for IT modernization, as you know, over four or five-year period on an incremental basis, we\u2019re probably spending close to $0.5 billion, that generally once these different modules and components are put into operation, they then to get amortized over five to seven years and so maybe that adds a little bit to that $1 billion plus number. Chris Horvers : And then where does that depreciation tend to show up in terms of the margin bucket? I know you talked about central, but is that core as well? Richard Galanti : It's all SG&A. Virtually, all SG&A. Chris Horvers : Okay. Understood. Thanks very much, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities. Kevin Heenan : Hi. This is Kevin Heenan on for Bob Drbul. You had called out apparel as being strong within softlines. I was just wondering if there were any particular categories of brands within apparel that were particularly strong in the quarter. Richard Galanti : It\u2019s really all of the above. I mean, we have made a conscious -- over the last couple of years, a conscious effort to both, with brands and with Kirkland Signature, go bigger and deeper, mashing out big quantities in the stuff. And so it really is all over the board, names that you\u2019ve come to know like Dockers and Levi's and Carhartt and just a variety of ones. But also the KS, whether its women\u2019s activewear or what was -- the men\u2019s wear pant, certainly the five plus million KS shirts and men's dress shirts that we sell a year. So it\u2019s a lot of things. Kevin Heenan : Cool. Thanks. And then just my last question. We noticed you guys have handheld scanners now in store. As you are checking out, we\u2019re wondering, kind of how that test was going, understanding information around that? Richard Galanti : Yeah. Well, I think the handheld scanner -- well, there is two things that we used in handheld scanner. We give some level of autonomy to the operators on that. Some regions embraced it little more than others. Generally, what we find and I say there is two uses. One use is your clients are backing up and employee was one of those handheld scanners could go and essentially scan. It was a small basket. And you will say, if its top fold and you have things under other things, you can\u2019t do it. But they can help speed up the front-end by scanning -- in the case of a limited number of items, those items give that member a little print out with the barcode on it. When the member gets up to the cash register, the cashier can simply scan that barcode. It prints out and tenders that full transaction was all the detail. That\u2019s one way speeding up. The other thing, its use for is in terms of informing people, when it would make sense for them to convert from a regular member to the Executive Member based on their prior 12 months of purchases. So if lines are backed up a little bit and we can ask the member, if we can scan their card and we can let them know that based on their prior years purchases, they were paid as example in the U.S. of an extra $55 when $10 versus $55 and they would've earned well more than that. And so it\u2019s use for that, but we don't do that all the time because as we've increased shopping frequency, the member who said no doesn\u2019t want to have to say no. I mean, we cannot have. So we did that on a periodic basis. Kevin Heenan : Got you. All right. Thanks a lot for the information. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Oliver Chen : Thanks. Congrats on the performance and thanks for the details. Regarding a bigger picture question on online, where do you think the mix should go over time? Will it remain a little bit more modest as a percentage of total? And as you look at your guest and the customers like, which factors do people want to see you guys implement over time? And I just wanted to ask about food and protein and fresh food, what\u2019s your outlook for the inflation there? And will your pricing under price the inflation and how do you see that dynamic evolving? Richard Galanti : Let\u2019s start with the last question. I mean, our fresh foods people use some continuation on prices like cheese and milk and butter. A lot of that has to do with some shortages in China and so increased demand from China that has pushed that out a little bit. There is still some inflation in meat. I believe, you said that that pork expectation was coming back a little bit and cheese is finally coming down a little bit. So the expectation is yes, but not probably as severe like meat have been up 8% to 10% in prices. They will expect that level of additional inflation going forward but still some. In terms of pricing, generally, we\u2019re going to try to take price increases as early as possible and take price decreases as soon as possible. So if using the famous rotisserie chicken example, we maintain the price, while costs were going up for two years, we didn't -- when the input costs starts going down, we didn\u2019t change the price because we\u2019ve never raised it. But overall, we\u2019re going to lag a little bit because we won\u2019t be competitive. And getting back to the first question was on Costco.com and mix changes. Yeah, it should continue to inch up more towards. When we started it, it was all big ticket. In many cases hard to take home yourself or hard to install, or hard to put together items, whether its big-screen TVs or furniture or swingsets, you name it. We certainly wanted to be more than just that and I think again, we've seen some success there, so we keep trying things. What we don't see ourselves is being the entity that's going to deliver two different boxes of kid cereals to your doorstep at seven in the morning. Now we hope and look forward to some of these other entities that are doing those types of quick home deliveries for us to be their supplier, which we seem to be successful doing as well. But overall, we want our site to be thought about a more regular basis as well for our members. Oliver Chen : Okay. Richard Galanti : And some of those are health and beauty aid items. Some of those are sundries items will certainly help to close that too. Oliver Chen : And I\u2019ve used the mobile app. Do you feel like the mobile app is going to be a key part of traffic online for you as it evolves? Richard Galanti : It will. It\u2019s continuing and when we look at our - when Ginnie Roeglin represents each month in the budget meeting about Costco.com, we have higher and higher percentages of mobile app use. Not as nearly as much as some of the e-commerce entities out there but it\u2019s going in that direction. So, yeah, we\u2019ll keep getting better. Like everything at Costco, while our site is greatly improved from the original mobile apps that we did, there is room for improvement there and we know that. Oliver Chen : Okay. Thank you. And a last question. On the higher end strength, have you seen customer response in a very positive to higher price points or your assortment, as we see healthier high-end customers as well as your product assortment being very appealing? Richard Galanti : Well, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. That\u2019s what we do. I mean, since the beginning of time, we\u2019ve constantly try to trade customers up to better quality. We\u2019re still a merchant. We just want to sell a lot of stuff and higher-end stuff. And frankly, we can show great savings from that. If you go into our warehouses right now, it is partly for the holiday time and I\u2019ve seen some $3,000 and $5,000 and $7,000 wine and spirits pricing, which are great values at those price points. Certainly, our jewelry are higher end. Certainly, the fact that we do a great penetration in the bigger sized televisions, so that\u2019s something. Anecdotally, I remember also, at the end of calendar \u201808 and then to calendar \u201809, when economy went south fast. And I remember and of course, at the end of \u201808 and then to early \u201909, when we took some extraordinary markdowns on things like patio furniture in January, February because the economy just hitting people, weren\u2019t buying that much those big-ticket discretionary items. I remember, as we entered June, July as the buyers are getting ready to commit for the upcoming end of \u201809 into 2010 season, our CEO, Jim, at the time and our Head of Merchandising were reminding the buyers, don't start bringing the price points down. If you want to come back for a little volume, quantity fine, but let\u2019s -- we've traded our members up and our members expect higher end goods. Let\u2019s keep that going, because that's what we are -- that what helps us, one of the things that helps a standout in our view. Oliver Chen : Thanks. Thanks for the comments on the luxury goods and that experience. Best regards for the holidays. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matt Fassler : Thanks a lot. Good morning. It\u2019s Matt Fassler. Thanks for keep the call going here. My one question at this stage relates to IT modernization. Richard, if you could just talk about qualitatively, what you've gotten done and what is still on the common? And then how you would expect those additional investments to further enable the online in e-commerce effort? Thank you. Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, for those of you who have noticed for long time, it\u2019s going to keep us alive and growing. I mean, our view is as that, we were at the top of our game in terms of keeping systems, old legacy systems as long and as cheaply as possible. And the recognition is that we did have to modernize, we knew that and we started that really in earnest about two, two and a half years ago, getting ready to start that process. So, and our goal, of course, is to take us over the next 10 years to double our company and I\u2019m not trying to -- we don\u2019t have 10-year budgets, but certainly, at a reasonable growth factor that should be what we want to do. We need systems to do that particularly as we going to other countries and expand in existing smaller countries right now that we\u2019re in, smaller number of units and as we global source more. So, all those things are imperative and as you know, we've done very little historically with member data. Don't expect big things from us, but expect any little things still low-hanging food for us. So we\u2019ll be able to do a little more that. First order of business to get it done, what is being installed so far, we\u2019ve redone the front-end membership system. Right now, if you want to change your address or phone number, you have two ways to do it. You call at 800 number or you go by the membership desk. Well, if a million or 2 million if you do something every year, its one time each for 2 many people, it\u2019s 2 million times for us. So some simple things like that will start early next year, early to mid next year. But there's certainly lot more to do with that stuff, even some basics. We also redid the point-of-sale system and that\u2019s in, that\u2019s making -- and when I say that\u2019s in, it\u2019s just in. For the two months -- the last two months of calendar year, we have an unwritten or written rule, you can't -- don\u2019t do anything, just grow up the systems and the warehouse. And so, while we've now installed it in the number of locations and its will be on pilot and our operators want it and like it, and then it will say, scheduling and few other things, that will be into earnest until during half of calendar \u201915. There is one other thing, the payroll. We just redid the payroll system and that\u2019s pretty U.S only to start with, which is 70% of our company. And that's again something that\u2019s making life a little easier in the warehouses and there is some small benefits to that there. The big benefits are when we complete the things that you got to put these things including accounting systems in place first. Our accounting systems are planned to be installed as of this fiscal year end, so at the end of this August, fingers crossed, that will be the best time to do with it, the fiscal year end and currently, we\u2019re on test, but we will tell you more, how we are on test tomorrow. The -- beyond that, I mean, the big things that the users are excited about, if we look at our depot and truck fleet operation, there is some real savings and efficiencies in our depot operations that their aches to get in place, that still going to be six to 12 -- six to, I will say, six to 18 months out, because these are all overlapped -- these modules overlap each other somewhat. The challenges going to be as we -- as buyers who are use to doing things one way, have to do things little different. We learned a lot of lessons when we went to Spain. We started with basically the new SAP-oriented system and there, as you might expect there are few Costco people over there. We\u2019ve learned a lot, including pain in the behind things. So, I think that, we know what the expenses are and we know incrementally, we still got another year, year and half for that, by its own size it will -- then will have level off. Again, I think, looking two to five years out is when we\u2019re going to -- we have got to get over that hump and there will be, I am sure, some growing pains where we make those conversions. But we\u2019ve gotten a lot better of not just doing something and then letting everybody all the users figured out. We\u2019re using 10s and 20s and 30s of additions of people to certain departments focus entire, taking existing people to know us, our current systems and putting them on these SAP modernization projects. And so, we\u2019ve done a much better job of bringing good people in and committing to two or three years in some cases those people in that area. Matt Fassler : Thank you so much. Richard Galanti : So we\u2019ll continue. Matt Fassler : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky : Good morning, everyone. Richard, you may have said it, but I\u2019ll double check on this regarding the gas. What was the year-over-year decrease in the gas price and can you talk about gas gallons on a comp basis increase? Richard Galanti : The average price per gallon was down 7.3% and the comps were -- the gallons comps were I think 11%, I know it was a low double-digit, 10.5%. Chuck Cerankosky : Okay. 10.5. Richard Galanti : Yeah. Chuck Cerankosky : Okay. Thank you. And I\u2019m curious about the buying or having merchandise shift ahead of -- a little bit ahead of sales plan because of some of these slowdowns on -- in the ports? Where is the extra merchandise being stored? Is it in the clubs or is that in your depots, or even offsite? Richard Galanti : Well, Costco, yeah, no, it\u2019s not offsite. It\u2019s mostly in depots or the clubs. I mean we were stacked tall, but we turned it pretty fast too. It wasn\u2019t a huge issue, it was -- it wasn\u2019t issue, but it -- in terms of logistics of handling it. But basically the depots had little bit more for a few weeks. Chuck Cerankosky : Okay. So if it is selling it\u2019s there\u2026 Richard Galanti : Yeah. Chuck Cerankosky : \u2026 just gets it there ahead of time. Richard Galanti : All right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Mike Otway : Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Mike Otway in for Scott. Thanks for taking the questions. I think, first, Richard, you had said that outside of pharmacy that all the other ancillary businesses and their gross margin rates up in the quarter? So, I guess, outside of gas, which is obviously, transitory? How should we think about your ability to get some slight margin improvement on these other businesses over the course of the year? Richard Galanti : The ancillary, well, most of them were up year-over-year. I mean, a lot of it\u2019s -- it\u2019s particularly in some of the business like Optometry and Hearing Aid. I mean they -- the actual markup on the goods is higher than our range, because we included our own cost of sales calculation, the impact of the Hearing Aid tax or of the Optometrist and things like that. So it's -- but it's a when volume is driven its operating leverage is certainly in my view better than their warehouse as a whole. So more than anything, I mean, we keep looking to, as you've heard it before, bring prices down. Over the last couple of years when we introduced, I forget what the, it\u2019s 5.0 or 6.0, whatever the next level of the state-of-the-art Hearing Aids under our brand. We lowered the price point by close to $2,000 on by -- on a high-quality Kirkland Signature item made by well-known high-end people and we really drove that business. So we save the customer, we\u2019ve made fewer gross margin dollars, but a lot more units, fewer dollars per unit, but a lot more units Mike Otway : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, I guess, just switching gears on the international side, you guys obviously continue to fare pretty well, given the headwinds? But just kind of looking at profitability of the other international business outside of Canada and stepping back, over the last few years, you saw EBIT margins come down slightly in that portion of the business versus I think in the middle part of last decade they were moving up? What's changed and as you add more stores kind of in this segment internationally outside of Canada? What are your expectations for getting profit to move up slightly every year? And I know some of that is new store driven and everything like that but any thoughts there would be great? Richard Galanti : Well, I think, Craig, our CEO, has said is look that the goal is to first get to three pretax and we\u2019ll go -- see where we go from there. First and foremost, we are going to drive our business. We want to see improved profitability every year. And there's a lots of moving parts and some of these ancillary businesses helped Costco travel. There's a little but it's growing nicely. We\u2019ve got new people in last couple of years in our business centers, what I'll call the 10-plus year test there too. We have them moving in the right direction. We\u2019ve got eight of them and little bit of a few more so. So there's lots of things out there. The global sourcing initiatives does two things. It's generally limited resource commodity type items in some cases. In our view, what sets us apart in terms of quality and value, and that drives other business. So there's, I think we are less looking and saying how can we -- do we want to -- we want to grow -- first and foremost, we want to grow comps. You can take out inflation and every thing else. Can we get comps in that mid-single digit to a little higher? If we can do that than how we get topline sales a little higher and then how do we leverage that. We\u2019ll keep doing what we are doing and we are not as concerned about one quarter or one year being a little less. I know we've gone up and down, but certainly we feel comfortable that we've got things in place to keep driving bottomline hopefully a little better than topline. But there will be fluctuations in that. Mike Otway : Okay. Great. I appreciate it. Thanks again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robby Ohmes : Hey Richard, another gas question, I know you, love these. From history or maybe the question being when historically, you've moved into a lower gas price environment, big declines year-over-year at the pumps like we are seeing and could see more of. What do you guys tell the buyers to do then? What categories tend to do better when you're having a pretty dramatically falling gas pump prices? Thanks. Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t think we are smart enough to sit around and say with this extra profit what we can do. I talked to Doug Shaw, the head of U.S. merchandising the other day. His view was is that we are doing everything we're doing anyway. This helps some. Do we do a little more, sure but -- it gives us a little bit more umbrella but we are going to keep doing it. Robby Ohmes : All right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore. Greg Melich : Hi. Thanks. Rich. I thought we had a couple of questions left here but could you update us on inflation across the store both in COGS and at the retail level? Richard Galanti : Yeah, if you look -- here we go. Basically again a very slight deflation for the first 12 weeks where food and sundries has very slight inflation. Sundries is a very slight inflation like less than 10 basis points. Apparel is very slight inflation also less than 10, right. So that\u2019s really end of our fiscal year. And food, of course, for all of fiscal \u201813 was up about 3.5 percentage points on a cost of goods basis. But again for the first 12 weeks of this month, it's ever so slightly up. Computers and appliances and things like that are down about a point. Gas, of course, is down as you a little bit. And those are pretty much the pulls and it all adds up to being down less than half percentage point since the beginning of our fiscal year. That's versus being up a 0.5 percentage point all of last year from the beginning of the prior fiscal year. Greg Melich : That\u2019s helpful and that\u2019s at the COGS levels and same with retail? Richard Galanti : Yeah. Greg Melich : Okay. Richard Galanti : Yeah. I would say the same at retail, if its inflation, maybe its a little thick under that because of our lag but overall it's pretty close. Greg Melich : Great. And then the second question was I think it was on September, you switched your -- interchanged your card partner in Canada. Could you help us understand how that changes the dynamics either in sales or profits in the business? And also remind us, when your Amex deal expires or when that\u2019s due in the U.S.? Richard Galanti :  Sure. Well, we basically had long-term agreements in Canada and we have one here. We don't really talk about our current contracts. We\u2019ll let you know when and if anything happens. But any ongoing contracts and anything we really don\u2019t talk about. But in Canada, again we made the switch currently for I think about a three-month period ending the end of this month we set both. So we started accepting MasterCard a couple of months ago. And we\u2019ll continue to accept as well American Express in Canada though the end of the calendar year. Look, we would have done it if it wasn't the most attractive deal for us. And remember -- and I would probably reverse the order if this was 10K for our member and us long term because we are going to continue to try the right value. And so we think it's -- the transition is always a little bit of a hassle, but we worked well with both our former partner and our new partner. Everybody acts professionally in this thing and these things happen. And we have a good relation currently in the U.S. So we'll see where that goes in the future. But as it relates to Canada, I think we're now up to -- and it\u2019s not required yet. As of last month, we are in the 30s in terms of the percentage of people using MasterCard, recognizing 40 plus percent of our transactions in Canada before anything else is a debit. And as you might expect MasterCard has a higher penetration of cardholders in Canada. We want to get that rewards-based card out there. And because infinity programs drive sales, not only in Costco but drive reward-based credit card programs. When we get that member using that card, that co-brand card, the same helped through with American Express co-brand. Will they use it elsewhere, it changes and improves the economics for us, which allows us to again provide a better solution to our member and continue to be more aggressive out there. Greg Melich : It\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Richard Galanti : It\u2019s going as expected, fine and stay tuned in the U.S. what we may or may not do in the future. Greg Melich : That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joe Feldman : Yeah. Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And most have been asked, but I wanted to ask something related to the food side of the business. And I know in the past we've spoken about opportunities within food like new products, maybe organic, natural, more. And I know you've made strides with some of that. But any update on where you stand with organic and natural and how much you could do there? Richard Galanti : Look I think we can do a lot more. The supply chain is improving and increasing everyday not just for us. Again I think in two years, we've gone to the U.S. from about $1.4 billion to close to $3 billion in organic and that's with supply constraints. So -- our view is there is couple of positives for our view. One is it's not always a substitute sale. I gave the example and perhaps is an extreme example what for the first 25 million of fresh organic ground beef we did a year and a half or so ago on a multi-hundred million dollar fresh ground beef program. But again $25 million and first 25 million organic, 80% of it was to existing members that historically didn\u2019t buy ground beef from us because they buy organic. And so that was added sales in that way. The other positive is generally in the retail business. Organic is high -- it was always a higher price point. But it's also generally the higher margin items. This kind of like the sale item you see on white goods is the refrigerator without the icemaker with a small freezer compartment and then you go in, you want the one with all -- the bigger one with all the extra whistles and bells. Same thing with this, we can generally make a little bit better margin and save the customer more and have a higher price point item. So again its growing. It\u2019s a $3 billion business. I can\u2019t tell you how quickly it will grow, but it's growing certainly faster than our topline overall. Joe Feldman : Got it. Thank you. And then also wanted to follow-up with the -- you\u2019ve mentioned LivingSocial deal a couple times this quarter, last quarter. Should we expect more on that front or more things like that to come? Richard Galanti : Well, it's a Catch-22. It worked, recognizing we don\u2019t do a lot of it. But we also don\u2019t want our members to get comfortable waiting -- our people comfortable waiting for the next deal. So we are going to do things on a sporadic basis, on irregular basis. But we at least -- as Craig said to our heads of merchandising e-commerce and membership marketing try some things. And so we are trying some things. So we are not -- we\u2019ll let you know that the things that we tried generally work. But it's not like we want to change our methodology. We wanted also make sure that the value of the membership is the value of the membership. But we\u2019ll keep trying some things. Joe Feldman : Got it. Thanks and good luck with this quarter guys. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Why don\u2019t we take two more questions? And I am sure you guys are tired of listening to me. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And there are no more audio questions at this time. Richard Galanti : Well, thank you every one and have a good day. Operator :  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for joining today\u2019s conference call. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

My name is Brandy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter Earnings and February Sales Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin your conference. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Brandy. Good morning to everyone. This morning\u2019s release we\u2019ll review our second quarter and first half fiscal 2015 operating results for the 12 and 24 week periods ended February 15th and our monthly four week sales results for the four week period ending this past Sunday, March 1st. The discussions we well be having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. To begin with, our 12 week second quarter fiscal \u201915 operating results, as you saw this morning for the quarter reported earnings per share came in at a $1.35, up 29% from last year\u2019s $1.05. As noted in this morning\u2019s release this year\u2019s net income was positively impacted by a $57 million or $0.13 a share income tax benefit. This was in connection with a portion of the $5 per share special cash dividend paid by the Company last month to Company\u2019s 401(k) plan participants. Partially offsetting this reduction to the income tax line was a $14 million or $0.03 a share income tax charge related to an ongoing overseas income tax letter. And the net impact of these two discrete tax items to our reported second quarter earnings $1.35 earnings per share was $43 million or $0.10 a share to the positive. So excluding these two items EPS for the second quarter would have been a $1.25 or up 19%. Other factors that have impacted our second quarter when you're comparing year-over-year results, gasoline operations as results of the case in Q1 \u201915, we benefitted from strong margins and profits in our gas business, I\u2019ll speak to this a little bit more, when I discuss our gross margin. FX as compared to year ago, in Q2 this year, the foreign currencies where we operate weaken versus the U.S. dollar in all countries but primarily in Canada, Mexico and Japan, this resulted in our foreign earnings in Q2 when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about 32 million pre-tax or $0.05 a share and those earnings would have been had FX exchange rates been flat year-over-year, so again another -- a relative weakening of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Third, IT modernization cost, as discussed in each of the past eight or 10 or so fiscal quarters, our major IT modernization efforts will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expenses through this year and into next year and possibly well beyond especially as new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In Q2 on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by an estimated $22 million or about $0.03 a share. Fourth, stock compensation expense, this was higher year-over-year in the quarter by $14 million or $0.02 a share, while this charge was about a 4 basis point hit to SG&A it was much smaller year-over-year impact to SG&A this quarter than it was in Q1 when the year-over-year delta was $38 million or $0.06 a share to the negative. Lastly interest income and other, this number was lower year-over-year in Q2 by 10 million in pre-tax or $0.02 a share. The decrease primarily related to the revaluation and settlement of U.S. dollar payables, primarily in our Mexico operations. As you know this line item if you will it goes back and forth sometimes it helps us a little sometimes it hurts us a little. Under GAAP these adjustments are recording to the interest income and other line. Now in terms of sales for the quarter reported sales were up 4.3% and our 12 week reported comp sales for the year was up 2%. For the quarter sales were negatively impacted by significant year-over-year gas price deflation and this had about a 323 basis point impact to the number to the negative and by weakening FX foreign currencies relative to U.S. dollar. This was just under 250 basis points to the negative. So excluding gas our reported 4% U.S. comp sales increase in Q2 would have been plus 8, our reported minus 2 international comp assuming flat year-over-year FX rates would have been plus 8% as well. As for the total comps again reported 2% for the quarter plus 2% excluding gas and FX was plus 8% for the quarter on a more normalized basis. For our four week month of February which includes the last two weeks of the fiscal second quarter reported comps came in at plus one consisting of a plus two comp in the U.S., flat international. Sales again were negatively impacted by gas price deflation almost 400 basis points for the month to the negative and weakening FX just under 300 basis points to the negative. So excluding gas the plus 2% reported comp for February would have been a plus 7 the reported flat international comp would have been actually been a plus 12. And there is a little benefit in there from the switch in the Lunar New Year I believe that impacted a couple of the Asian countries for us and so as to the total comps the reported plus one for the month would have been a plus 8 excluding gas inflation and FX. In terms of new openings after will be 9 new locations in Q1 including one reload we opened no new locations in Q2 all-to-all that puts our fiscal 2015 openings to the same quarter store as eight net new locations and we now operate 671 locations around the world. Which we now and the end of fiscal 2015 we expect to open an additional 20 new locations. And just a couple in Q3 which will end in early to mid May and then 18 planned for Q4 of these 20 additional openings before our August 30th fiscal year-end 10 are in the U.S. and 10 will be international. So it should most likely end the fiscal year with 691 total locations. Now a few of those near the very end of the fiscal year could slip into Q1 of \u201916. So my guess is that that additional 20 may be \u201917, \u201918 to those. Also this morning I'll review to you our e-commerce activities, our membership trends and renewal rates a little more discussion on margins and SG&A in the quarter. Our recent $5 a share special cash dividend in the related billion dollar debt offering and our recent announcement related to the planned changes for our U.S. co-branded credit card offering. For our second quarter results, sales for the quarter for the 12 weeks ended February 15th were 26.87 billion up 4% from last year's 25.76 billion. On a reported comp basis as I mentioned Q2 comps were up 2 but up 8 excluding gas and FX. Now for the quarter that reported plus two was a combination of an average transaction decrease of a little over minus 3%. But again taking gas out of that number the average transaction increase would have been plus taking gas and FX out of that number the average normalized transaction increase would have been a little over 2% to the positive. And average frequency increased a little over five and a half. So year-to-date shopping frequency is up a little over 5%. In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region for the quarter in terms of geography Midwest, Southeast and Northeast regions were the strongest. Internationally local currencies Japan was the weakest still impacted by cannibalization of two units we opened in the last 12 months on a total base of only 20 over there. And with Taiwan, Korea and Mexico being strongest in local currency comps. In terms of merchandize categories for the quarter for the second quarter within Food and Sundries overall in the mid single-digits Candy, meat, daily, beer and wine were the relative standouts. Within hardlines overall in the low single-digits, departments were the strongest retires in electronics and consumer electronics was up in the mid single-digits. Within mid single-digit softlines comps domestics and apparel were standouts and in fresh foods where comps were in the high singles meat showed the best results although impacted by inflation there. For February traffic was up again 5% well average transaction on a reported basis was down 3.5% but again getting really impacted by FX and even weaker gas year-over-year. Gas prices during the month before we left the February year-over-year the average pricing of gas was almost down to 31.5%. In terms of geography Midwest, Southeast and Bay Area regions were the strongest during February and internationally in local currencies Taiwan and Korea were the strongest as I mentioned previously the shift in the New Year holiday from January to February negatively impact January comps and positively impact February comps for the company probably about 50 basis points each way. From a merchandize category standpoint ex-FX food and sundries overall for the month was in the mid single-digit range hardlines overall came in to the mid single-digits which was consist with what electronics did, during February softlines was up in the mid single-digit range and finally fresh foods up nicely in the low-teens overall with meat being the strongest and again as I mentioned this thing was quite a bit of replenishment in that area. Moving on the line items down the income statement, membership fees we\u2019re up 4 basis points and up 6% from $550 million a year ago in the quarter to 582 or up $32 million, take out FX up 6% in dollars would have been up 9%. In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates still is at 91, I think just a shade under that but averaging up to 91 and for the first time our fully captured worldwide rate is rounding up to 88 and sets us down to 87. Continue to increasing penetration of as you would actually remember of course helps us as well as those members tend to be the most loyal. New membership signups in Q2 companywide were up 9%. In terms of members in Q2 end, in terms of Gold Star, we ended Q2 with 32.7 million members, up from 32.0 million up about a little under 700,000 from the end of the first quarter 12 weeks earlier. Primary business it\u2019s jumped from 6.9 million to 7.0 million add-on remained at 3.5 million, so the total numbered households 42.5 million at the end of Q1 at 43.2 million at the end of Q2 and representing total card holders going from 77.5 to 78.7 over the 12 weeks fiscal quarter at Q2 end on February 15th, paid executive memberships were a shade over 15.4 million, which is an increase of 188,000 during the quarter of about 15,000 a week and that\u2019s both new member signups as well as conversions. Executive members as I mentioned before a little over two-thirds of our -- about two-thirds of our membership base a little over two-thirds of our membership base and just about two-thirds of our sales -- I am sorry about one-third of our membership base and about two-thirds of our sales. In terms of renewal rates, they continue strong again from business member renewal rates and Q1 end was 94.5, it tweaked up to 94.6 at the end of Q2, Gold Star was 89.8 that pinched up to 89.9 and total was -- remained at a 90.7 and worldwide the 87.3 went to an 87.9. You\u2019ll see a little bit bigger increase there because when you start at a lower base that tends to improve a little bit faster in those first few years. Now I\u2019ll comment on this past Monday\u2019s press release regarding Costco entering into long-term co-branded credit card agreement with Citi and our acceptance and co-brand agreement with Visa. Yes, the press release stated we\u2019ve entered into a new co-branded credit card agreement with Citi and an acceptance and co-branded incentive agreement with Visa these agreements are subject to purchase from American Express of the existing co-branded credit card portfolio by Citi and would be implemented until next April 1, 2016 at the end of our current co-brand arrangement. While there is not a lot of specifics I can give you at this point, but I can tell you the following, once issued the new co-brand cost of Visa credit card will be accepted throughout United States and Puerto Rico, the new rewards based card will be fee free. The new card will needless to say provide generous rewards to Costco members utilizing the new card and again I can\u2019t tell you a lot of specifics about that, but we certainly look forward to telling you and our members more about it, but it probably is not going to be until several months down the road this calendar year. The new card of course will also service the members Costco membership card, again there is not a lot detail we can give you at this point needless to say what we do is ultimately for the long-term benefit for our Company and our members in this case the co-branded credit card holders as well. Pulling down the gross margin line, gross margins were up 54 basis points on a reported basis from 10.53 to 11.07. As I always ask you to do I will ask you to notch out four columns and six line items the columns of course will be Q1 \u201915 both reported or without gas deflation and then the columns three and four would be Q2 \u201915 reported and without gas deflation. And going across those lone items, the first one is co-merchandize and reported in Q1 was minus 6 basis points year-over-year without gas deflation was minus 13. In Q2 reported was plus 10, without gas deflation was minus 20, ancillary plus 22 and plus 20 in Q1 and plus 46 and plus 49 in Q2, 2% reward minus 1 and minus 1 and then minus 5 and minus 2, LIFO plus one and plus one, and then in Q2 plus three and plus three, and then other plus six and plus seven in Q1 and zero and zero in Q2 all totaled in Q1 \u201915 year-over-year to Q1 \u201914 we had a reported gross margin improvement of 22, which is the sum of those line items from column one on a gas neutral basis it was plus 14. Again reported for this quarter it was plus 54 and on a gas neutral basis excluding gas deflation was a plus 20. And now as you can see again our overall gross margin was outside plus 54 and even at plus 20 without gas deflation. Again a lot of this has to do with gas sales penetration, which were up as well even though at the lower price per gallon. Our core merchandise drove margin was up 10 basis points year-over-year, but again excluding as you can see in this chart it was down 20, again this is a function of both increased sales penetration and strong gross margins with our gas business. If you look at the core gross margins as a percent of the various departments of their own sales and then when I talk about core, I am talking about food and sundries, hardlines, and softlines and fresh foods which account for about 80 plus percent of our total sales. On their own sales they were down year-over-year by 3 basis points in the second quarter with food and sundries and hardlines being up year-over-year a little and softlines and fresh foods being down a little frankly margins are fine we're driving sales and certainly gas prices give us probably room to be to continue to be aggressive. Although the gas prices going up the other way right now we\u2019re -- don\u2019t expect to see those kinds of outsized gas profits in the next quarter. Ancillary and other business gross margin was up 46 on a reported basis 39 without gas deflation again our gas business accounted for nearly two-thirds of this Q2 year-over-year increase. But we also showed higher year-over-year margins in optical, hearing aids and pharmacy. The impact of the increasing executive membership was good is hit margins by 5 basis points or 2 basis points without gas deflation and again that\u2019s 2% reward feature this just generally reflects to continue to increase sales penetration from the executive remembers which again as I mentioned buy more and are more royal and shop more frequently. LIFO in the second quarter we recorded a $4 million credit pre-tax compared to a $5 million pre-tax charge last year so about a penny a share or 3 basis points benefits year-over-year for 9 million to the gross margin. Moving on to SG&A our SG&A percentage Q2-over-Q2 was higher or worst by 11 basis points come in at 994 this year versus a 983 last year again we'll do the same four columns reported and without gas impact Q1 '15 then columns three and four Q2 '15 both reported and without gas. Five line items first one is core operations or just operations plus 8 basis points was reported in Q1 I mean and plus year is a positive mean lower year-over-year plus 15 without gas deflation and Q2 was a plus three and a plus 29 central minus and minus one and in Q2 minus 10 and minus 7 so higher year-over-year on that note. Stock compensation minus 11 and minus 11 and the minus 4 and minus 3 they are no quarterly adjustments so the last line item will be total again we reported a minus 4 or year-over-year SG&A higher by 4 basis points in Q1 both on a reported basis plus 4 or lower by 4 basis points in Q1 without gas deflation. Again in Q2 higher or minus 11 basis points and then better or lower by 19 basis points. So plus 19 basis points without gas deflation another editorial on SG&A here again the operations component of SG&A was better by three in Q2 on a reported basis and better by 29 year-over-year excluding gas deflation. Again gasoline sales penetration and very low SG&A in the gas business certainly helps that number. Within operations excluding gas and other warehouse businesses and so taking all that out payroll benefits represented an improvement of 16 points of this 29 basis point improvement. So again strong sales overall certainly helped us improve payroll and benefits as well and get some leverage there. Central expense was higher year-over-year by 10 or 7 without gas inflation as I mentioned earlier increased IT spending for monetization this was a 7 basis points on a reported basis 5 basis points without deflation in FX and lastly in both years we had a few discreet items to the tune of about minus 5 basis points but that is what it is. Finally with SG&A our stock compensation expenses I mentioned was higher or worst by 4 basis points on a reported basis three without gas deflation. Next on the income statement line pre-opening expense, 8 million last year and 9 million this year. Last year we had three opening this year we had no opening but we got plenty of opening coming up so you have got quite of a bit of pre-opening expense rates starting in this also the little things that goes with that number no real surprises. Our total operating income for Q2 came in at 877 million 21% higher year-over-year or higher by 153 million compared to last year\u2019s 724 million in the quarter. Below the operating income line reported interest expense was essentially the same year-over-year coming at 26 million last year and 27 million this year. As I mentioned earlier interesting income and other was lower by 10 million coming in last year in the quarter of 30 million to the positive this year only 20 million to the positive. Actual interest income for the quarter was higher by three the other swing was a minus 13 and again most of that relates to year-over-year swings and various FX things in this case I think the biggest piece was the revolution settlement of dollar payables U.S. dollar payables primarily in our Mexico operations I think that was a small positive in the last quarter. Overall pre-tax income was higher by 20 or up 142 million from 728 million last year in the quarter to 870 million this year. In terms of income taxes our company tax rate this quarter came in at a needless to say on a reported basis at a very low 30.2% versus 35 over last year again the income tax line benefited primarily from a $57 million tax benefit in connection with the special cash dividend. Dividends paid on cost per share has helped by our employees in our foreign K plan which totaled about 29 million shares are deductable for U.S. income tax purposes and we recognized a one-time income tax benefit of approximately $57 million related to that as I mentioned there was an offset to that benefit of about 14 million after tax charge in the income tax line related to an outgoing income tax matter. Excluding these two items our Q2 tax rate this year was actually up would have been up a 10% to 35.1 just slightly higher compared to last year's 35.0 on a normal basis. Overall reported net income was 463 last year compared to a reported 598 in net income this year again this year's net income on a reported basis was up 28%-29% taking out those two tax items up about 19%. For a quick rundown of other topics with a lot of the balance sheet as included in the morning\u2019s press release, a couple of balance sheet information items, depreciation and amortization for Q2 totaled 260 million in the quarter and 514 million year-to-date, accounts payable ratio, accounts payable as a percent of inventories on a reported basis has shown improvement year-over-year from a 93% figure to a 97. There is a lot of construction payables in that it's showed a comparable improvement from an 83 if you just to merchandise -- accounts payable as a percent of merchandise inventories, merchandise accounts payable as a percent of merchandise inventories 83% last year up to 87% this year in the quarter. Average inventory per warehouse was during the year flat coming in at 12.8 million this year on average per warehouse about $20,000 compared to a year ago so pretty much flat. FX year-over-year inventory levels were up -- would have been up about $350,000 or about 2.7% of sales on again an 8% sales increase. So, I think this control of our inventories and inventory is in good shape mid-year fiscals came in just fine because of the inventories. I\u2019ll respond at this point to questions received in the past few months about the work slowdowns as you know on the West Coast ports. There is a week and a half ago I guess there was a new agreement, so things are getting back to order although the view is it will take four to eight weeks if not a little longer to get through the backup there, we like I am sure every other importer of containers, I try to identify which ones have priority where we can and really there is some pretty much the impact of that\u2019s over when we talk to our heads of merchandising in the different areas maybe using the tool we might probably got hit by $100 million-$200 million nothing to really speak off in terms of sales and there is probably a little worse for some others out there. In terms of CapEx, in Q1 we spent $555 million on CapEx, in Q2 we spend 619 million, so quarter-to-date just under a $1.2 billion. For the year, we still expect to be somewhere in the $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion range, which is up from $2.0 billion last year. In terms of Costco Online, we continue to operate it into four countries, U.S., Canada, UK and Mexico. We\u2019re also doing things not really online, but through Alibaba Tmall in Asia, but in terms of the four countries online there is costco.com, sales and profits needless to say were up during the quarter, sales were up 23% in the quarter, comp sales in the U.S. were similarly up right around 23%, foreign sales in the other three countries were up on a local currency basis 20 and more percent as well, but again with currencies being down there is some impact there, but overall continued good results of sales strength on our .com efforts. In terms of expansion as I mentioned, we planned in Q3, to open three units including one relocation so a net of two and have current plans for 19 which includes one reload, so a net of 18 new in Q4. Assuming we opened those, we\u2019ll be at 28 net new units for the year or about 4.5% square footage growth and by country assuming we get to 28 it would be 17 in the U.S. so a little under two-thirds there, one in Canada, one in the UK, five in Asia, one in Korea, one in Taiwan and three in Japan, as well as one in Australia and three new in Mexico. As of Q2 end total square footage stood at 96.4 million square feet. In terms of stock buybacks, in Q1 as you know we started the process about a little bit, we brought $18 million worth or 139,000 shares at an average price of a little over $126 a share. In Q2, we spended $92 million to buy 642,000 shares at an average price of 143.21, now a bunch of that was done before the dividend date for the $5 ex-dividend date. In terms of dividends, our first quarterly dividend stands at $0.355 a share or at a $1.42 per share annualized that leaves as total cost to company and about $630 million. This regular dividend of course was an addition to $5 per share dividend which amounted to $2.2 billion that we paid out last on February 27th and in fact both dividends were paid to shareholders on February 27th. As I mentioned, we also completed a one -- to pay impart for the $2.2 billion special dividend, we did a $1 billion debt offering a few weeks back that 500 million of five-year fixed and 500 million of seven-year fixed at attractive market rates. Lastly just a couple of other items to note, the March comp sales reporting period for this year will include 34 selling days versus which is a day less than the 35 days last year, reflecting the calendar shift of the Easter holiday. And in addition beginning next month we will start reporting comp sales one day earlier than we have historically done so March comp sales will be announced on Wednesday, April 8th after the market close around 6 PM Pacific Time and 9 PM Eastern Time, hopefully that will help our East Coast friends and similarly our Q3 scheduled earnings release date will be Wednesday, May 27th for the 12 week third quarter ending May 10th. Again the release will occur at 6 PM Pacific Time, 9 PM Eastern Time that Wednesday with the earnings conference call still occurring the following morning. Before I turn the call back to Brandy for Q&A, hopefully I have helped everyone understand some of the factors impacting the number. Overall, I think we had certainly the outsized gas profits helped, but there were lots of other little things that went the other way so overall still we felt pretty good a quarter and certainly strong sales membership renewal rates and alike. With that, I'll turn it back to Brandy for any Q&A. Thank you. Hello. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee. Charles Grom : I guess my first question is when you look at your gas business today clearly it's a bucket for you guys to pull funds and invest back in pricing for you guys to kind of be like Costco if you will. Is there a way to quantify that this quarter I mean clearly the core margins within the [indiscernible] of the business being down 3 basis points, was there some impact for you guys being more aggressive on price or if you can maybe just speak to arithmetically? Richard Galanti : I think qualitatively it allowed us to be a little more aggressive we didn\u2019t just say, hey take this extra money and put it all there we didn\u2019t. We certainly benefited from in the quarter. And again it's not like we looked at this as that will be an offset to FX as an example because we know that FX has still got even if FX rates continue to stay where they are right now and don\u2019t get any relatively weaker it's still on a relative basis in Q3 and 4 maybe relatively weaker so yes we've recognized it Q3 and 4 will be a little more challenge in that regard but certainly food margins have been up a few instead of down a few probably but who knows. Charles Grom : And then when you look to March of next year and then change in tenders because my understanding is roughly 750 million U.S. visa card holders today and there's roughly 50 million AMX holders today in the U.S. How bigger opportunity this could be for you guys to expand your membership base when you move into next year? Richard Galanti : Well we'll see I mean there's a lot of unknowns, the first order business is for Citi to work with American Express and figure out the account portfolio a lot hinges on that we expect that to happen but there's no guarantees and there'll be -- and again there's a lot I'd like to tell you there's a lot we'll figure it out now. We know the bucket of dollars if you will in our mind of what we can use to drive usage of that kind of card to recognizing there'll be some cannibalization somebody that has a visa mileage card in their wallet. They may want to use that instead. Just like there is cannibalization now there's people who use a non-cobranded AMX card. Similarly there'll be other places where there's outside spend increase because your neighborhood drycleaner one card is accepted and another card is not, so there's lots -- I think there's lots of opportunities we have to get there first and first order business is the transition itself and there'll be a lot more to say once we get there. Charles Grom : And then just last question on e-commerce up 23% in the quarter, can you just remind us number of skews online today relative to a year ago? And where you think that can go? How much is costing through your depots versus not and then just margins on e-commerce relative to the clubs? Thanks. Richard Galanti : That is probably approaching 8,000 regular skews and excluding from that that we have a lot of tyre skews based on all the sizes we've got a lot of office product skews through a third-party but core skews on our side is 8,000 probably 1,500 plus more than a year ago and I'm guessing there but that's probably a big number. And then those increases are a lot of sundries items, some apparel items things like that probably gets you to come back on a more frequent basis and smaller ticket items a lot of the items a lot of the items we have added are items like I've mentioned versus $300 to $2,000 televisions and furniture sets. Charles Grom : Any color on profitability? Richard Galanti : Excuse me? Charles Grom : Just as margins in the e-commerce business? Richard Galanti : Margins overall are probably are a shade lower SG&A is a lot lower so profitability wise e-commerce is a very profitable operation relative to the company as a whole. Operator : Your next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So Richard two part question to get kind of the same thing you've got some very busy clubs and you keep increasing traffic mid single-digit every year and you guys spend a lot of time looking at kind of quality of experience in the club in maybe different parts of the club right like fresh and with that in mind is there an opportunity to open more clubs in the U.S. than you might have thought before maybe cannibalize yourselves gain share improve the experience if some of them are too crowded have you guys done work on that? Richard Galanti : Well yes in a lot of different ways but not in terms of let's sit down and do that today at one-time I mean first of all quality of experience as you I think know I'm sure you know our operators and our merchants are in the warehouses a lot create and a random set of merchandising and operating victims just spend two days shopping around part of the country visiting warehouses both us in competition and other things and looking in the sites, so I think certainly the member responses that we get every day the types of throughput for hours and front end registers all those things go into that and I got to tell when a member writes a little complaint then that could be nasty just a complaint it just hurt and recognizing we\u2019re always been have some challenges. So we're constantly looking for that experience and we're constantly looking for that to get you out of there faster and to make it a better experience. I got to tell you we still get probably more positive than negatives in terms of e-mails that are sent in to senior management about positive experience as with a member with a particular employee who they have helped in a warehouse something like that and beyond so we have no illusion that we do everything right but we're pretty steadfast of looking all those things in terms of really deliverable units absolutely I mean if you would have ask me five years ago when we're opening about 20 units a year and probably I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me we're probably it is 70-30 U.S. and you said Richard five year heads where you are going be and I'd say well we're going to be about 30 and we actually got there pretty close. And if it's 70-30 U.S. backed then it's probably 50-50 heading into 30-70 over the next five years and here we are almost 50-40 still in U.S. I think that\u2019s a reflection of we're finding probably more opportunities that we thought possible some of it's what you mentioned openly up in busy that quality of experience the units that are 250 and 300 and even the 300 plus trying to get those in trying to balance that because cannibalization does cause a little heartburn per year. But a lot of it also is as I think surprising how many units we can put in some of the newer markets so that newer is a relative term newer markets over the last -- in markets that we've been in for the last five or 10 years. So I think it's a combination of all that again last year I think of the 20 in fact I have it here hold on, of the, here it is of the 20 -- in fiscal \u201913 I am sorry last year of the 29 net openings we had I think 16 were in the U.S. and this year of the 29 or 16 or 17 were in the U.S. a little over half and this year it's what did I say 17 out of 28 so almost two-thirds and so I think you'll probably five years from now as we go from let\u2019s say 30 to 35 probably still half are in the U.S and then we are finding more opportunities. John Heinbockel : Do you think you can get to a 1,000 there ultimately or have you gone out that far? Richard Galanti : Well we haven\u2019t gone out that far as yet yes if we added 30 year for 10 years around a sense there so yes I think so but certainly not out of the relm. John Heinbockel : And then secondly what the though at least it seems like anecdotally maybe in certain items or categories there may be Kirkland introduced maybe the brand or a brand is no longer carried. I don\u2019t think there is a conscious effort to although the quality and value Kirkland certainly outstrips a lot of the brands. A conscious effort to get more Kirkland items in the store more space to them is there a conscious effort or that\u2019s just kind of it happens you put in it is where the demand is and so maybe it squeezes out some brands along the way? Richard Galanti : Well I think there is an ongoing conscious effort to there are people that are in charge of coming up with new Kirkland stuff in each merchandize category and their job is to try to find new things just like any buyers job is to find good exciting branded items. And ultimately an item it is our cousin it has got the name on it but it has to live and die like any other item I think if we've added 30 or 40 items in the past 12 or 18 months that should we subtracted 20 or 30 that ultimately did work out when though we bring back some a few years later that worked better I remember years ago we had a organic peanut butter Kirkland team ensured that didn\u2019t set the world on fire. I think we're now testing again and it's a pretty good item. But we'll see how long pretty good means. So it has to -- we recognize the strength of our concept is both KS and brand and I don\u2019t think we if you said Richard you are in the mid 20s now in terms of KS do you ever see going to 50 I\u2019d have to stretch I mean even our own members internally will say how can we get it from 25 to 30 there is no formal game plan how many years is that going to take what items work and certainly there is a not a lot of low hanging fruit there is lots of $20 million and $30 million and $50 million overtime. Not a lot of 300 million and 400 million items like paper goods or water and things like that or K stuffs. John Heinbockel : Okay thank you. Richard Galanti : And last comment before getting to the next question out there in terms of cannibalization even if that\u2019s ramped up a little bit. I was just looking over the last few years if you go back to fiscal '13 what we called cannibalization that\u2019s just not just here that\u2019s opening three units in Japan and that affects three or five other Japanese units. Total cannibalization in fiscal '13 was 65 basis points and \u201914, 58 and for the first half of this year it looks like it's about something in the low 40s so it\u2019s going to fluctuate between 35 and 75 depending on what we do and where we do it, but my guess is something in the 40 to 50 range is kind of -- we\u2019ll have to be able to move that number overall a lot. Operator : Your next question is from Dan Binder with Jefferies. Dan Binder : My first question is related to the gas business, can you just give us an update on where the comp gallons were in the quarter, where gas is as a percentage of total sales? And then you mentioned that the gas margin would start to be little bit less favorable given where price is, what prices is doing. Can you help us just to understand kind of what the excess margin may have been in EPS this quarter? Richard Galanti : Yes, look it was just on that line item it was two-thirds of the margin improvement of all ancillary businesses. It could be 200 plus basis points of extra margin, I mean our margin in gas on a daily basis over the years could be anywhere from a zero to a five or six and it's all over the Board might even be a little bit higher sometimes, but it really ranges and frankly when it's a little higher, we\u2019re saving the customer more money. In terms of gallon it comes I remember for a couple of years when the U.S. overall not Costco, but all U.S. vehicle gallons consumption was in the low single-digits and maybe in the -- when the bad economy hit and went to the low negative single-digits and we went from, we remained at four, five, six, seven. Right now we\u2019re in the mid-teens. So, we\u2019re getting a lot of people coming into Costco to buy gas and that certainly drives them into the warehouse as well. Dan Binder : And then on the IT spend, you mentioned I think you said it was $0.02 this quarter as you look at Q3 and Q4, what do you expect that in fact look like? Richard Galanti : It's hard to guess completely, I know we\u2019ve had a couple of some of the original modules and modules makes it sound like it's a small number, these are big numbers but then you have projects that are $50 million-$60 million projects that the day you are put into service they then over the next in our case 55 four week periods over the next five years generally you take a little under a $1 million a month hit and so some of those are starting to hit so my guess is that much it will is it that much is a little less a little more it is hard to say but still over a several year period incrementally recognizing your denominator sales keep getting bigger too, but with that bigger sales we had indicated something in low to mid-teens of basis points I could be off by a couple of basis points but and they achieve. Dan Binder : And then my last question is related to organics, can you just give us an update on how many that skews are on in the club at this point and what the mix is of sales and how that performed in the quarter, how are you thinking about that business going forward? Richard Galanti : Yes, it's still a small percentage of Costco, it's a rising but it's a fast growing area as it is with a lot of other retailers as well. You're are going to see more and more of it a part of that is availability there is -- we could sell -- we and everybody else can sell a lot more if there was more out there. I think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job of winding up our sourcing and I think I mentioned last quarter that for all of \u201914 organic was like approaching 3 billion which was more than twice when it was two years earlier or a year and a half earlier. It's growing fast, I don\u2019t know if it is 50% a year, but it is certainly growing at a high and a low mid or mid double-digit number and it's great for us because we show even a better value on that stuff than some of the things that it replaces when we can do organic ground beef I mean for everybody football is regular ground beef and everybody makes lower than average margin this is the item that everybody tries to make more on, and so we can make a little more not a lot more and show a greater value to our member. So it will keep growing, I am sorry I can\u2019t be more specific. Operator : Your next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Mark Becks : Hi, it's Mark Becks on for Chris. Congrats on the fantastic quarter. Just a follow-up on a couple of Chuck's questions, actually, so it doesn't look like you are getting into too much specifics about the change in the credit card to AMEX, et cetera. Just curious what has been the response that you've seen from our friends up north? I knew that changed over in January -- maybe what the reception has been there? Richard Galanti : Well it's been good so far, I mean we\u2019re getting a lot of people to switch, recognizing it\u2019s peoples membership card as well and if anything our view of the U.S. should be -- I guess I can\u2019t get into a lot of it right now. We wouldn\u2019t have done this if we thought there was a lot of risk associated with it, we think it's a big positive over a long period of time, but recognize big positive to us means giving most of it back to the customer in this case most of it back to the co-branded user of a credit card and that\u2019s going to happen -- we\u2019re really not going to be able to tell you a lot about it for a number of months. Mark Becks : Okay. I guess I'll switch back to the gas prices then. Historically, the adage has been you guys benefit when prices go up, but it looks like just based on gallonages and miles driven, which has only been up a couple percent, so you guys are actually capturing a lot more share now then in history period. Is that something you would agree with? Richard Galanti : Yes there is two places to that just so everybody understands. When prices go up, we make less and save the customer we still save them but save them less. When prices go down, we save them more and we make more. Certainly price is going down, we save the customer more and that's positive and we make a little more or a lot more right that's changed in the last few weeks, but we made a lot more in the last few quarters. If you go -- the other thing the thing I think you're talking about is when it was in the press everyday as prices went from $3 to $4 to $4 plus a gallon it was on the news every night in every city, that helped us I think. The offset to that would be as prices are less important, how can that help you? I don\u2019t know other than it is and it is a lot because our gallon is quite a bit up. Mark Becks : Did you see what the volume and gallonage was/ I think it was, call it, up 11% last quarter? Richard Galanti : It was in the mid-teens I think we mentioned. Mark Becks : So pretty big acceleration there and just finally on geography -- go ahead, sorry. Richard Galanti : Just getting back to that comment I think people ask us why I think it's because we do a good job of being the most competitively priced and there's that third-party as gasbuddy.com that 40 whatever million people and put their price on what they bought gas for. For three years in a row since they started announcing best overall low price out there by $0.14 a gallon or $0.16 a gallon across the country, now you're going to and that's not every station every day everywhere but on average with all those data points we're it and I think that kind of publicity helps us as well. Mark Becks : And then just the last question on geographical differences, it looks like you called out the Midwest and the South areas as the strongest obviously, a lot of moving pieces there, with the Chinese New Year as a help, but then the port shutdowns, which on our math comes out to 60 basis points roughly. Maybe just what you are seeing, elaborate a little bit geography, and then maybe the Northeast? I know we have seen some pretty severe weather here as of late? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Well look I think you summed up or re-summed up on the port strike in the Lunar New Year switch -- I think the big deal is weather has played a role although it did last year as well, but relative to New York, the Northeast as an example the four weeks that complies February the first two weeks were mid positive say normal after weeks were mid negative single-digit that's a huge swing but other areas did just fine and the Texas region got hammered in the last week with weather but overall we're -- it's been, we've done okay. Operator : Your next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : A couple quick ones, on the credit card, I know you not going to share a lot of details. Is there -- besides probably some savings just from some slower interchange fees or credit card fees, is there any elevators, such that if there are certain volumes met, you could see further benefits down the road? Or is this the lower fees, you will see a benefit upfront? And then from there, just how much business you do? Richard Galanti : As you're asking I'm looking at my wall behind me and there's a handwritten note from many years ago when our securities counsel is sitting here and quickly somebody's asking a question he wrote we have no comment beyond the release and then the reality is that there's lots of buttons that you push on these agreements there's all aspects of it at the end of the day whatever our current arrangement as we look at it whatever our current arrangement is with our current provider both what we pay what we receive to offset some of that what our member using that co-brand cardholder is rewarded with a premise of how much is that to start with where we think it can go to at the end of the day we can whatever that bucket of money is it can go towards lowering merchant fees raising rewards or using some other place in our company and we'll figure it out there's we think that's it's an exciting bucket and we'll do a lot with it but just like I've told people in the past if we can save the dollar on buying a product better whether it's detergent or coffee or anything or due to packaging or raw materials cost or energy cost we're going to give $0.80-$0.90 back to the customer and rest assured there'll be whenever benefit x is a little bit of will accrue to our P&L and a lot of it will accrue to the member in some way shape or form but none of that can really be -- we can\u2019t really tell you until next year. Simeon Gutman : On membership, I know you don't say a lot on international versus U.S., but can you just speak directionally to whatever growth rate you are seeing in membership, whatever trend line has been occurring, how has that -- has it changed much? Is it the same in the U.S. versus international? Richard Galanti : It's higher international because we're newer we didn\u2019t save -- and I think I've shared in the past I mean if you take the total number of members divided by our total number of warehouses you've got roughly 59,000 to 60,000 member households per warehouse in Japan you've got a number that has it's a three digit number it's in the low hundreds you also have a lower renewal rate in those first few years so it tends to bounce out overtime but we operate overall in other countries on a membership fee as a higher percent of sales particularly in Asia. Simeon Gutman : But whatever prevailing growth rate there has been in membership in the U.S., up until second quarter or up until the first -- meaning, has that run rate stayed the same in the U.S.? Richard Galanti : Yes and a lot of it is dictated by new openings and again it's going to be dictated more by what I said in new member signups in the quarter were up 9%. There have been times when it\u2019s been almost flat but prior are down a little bit because a year earlier in that quarter you opened three units in Asia where you might have and again I talked about an average of roughly 60,000 member households per location. We had locations that will have new member signups as of opening day and that as of day mean during the 8 or 10 or 12 weeks prior to opening when their parking lot is kind of set and we have the flags and the tabling activities out front side you could have anywhere from 25,000 to 40,000 members signed up now 40% of them renew a year later but in terms of new members coming in and buying a membership and that really distorts that number. So I don\u2019t know how much meaning is that plus 9 is a function that as well but we always point that out. Simeon Gutman : And then just very quickly, can you just remind us of the e-commerce business, is there other member-only items or is there items someone can just -- who is not a member can just come on the website and purchase as well? Richard Galanti : In this crazy world there are some items that we have online where we've agreed not to show the price unless you are a member. Simeon Gutman : Not to show the price but the only person who is buying on your Web site is a member? Richard Galanti : Yes. Operator : And your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : I wanted to just touch on membership as well. Certainly, with consistent and strong traffic and you certainly are saving people money at the pump, how are you thinking about the value proposition of your membership currently in the U.S. and international? What may be the timeline in terms of you kind of reassessing what you think the value of the membership should be? Richard Galanti : I think round about what you're asking about when do we see this I think the possibility of our fee change historically that\u2019s really we think about last. We drive prices and value everyday in everything we do and I mean it you go to our budget meetings every four weeks you got a day and a half of that time or a third of time is merchants and we\u2019re figuring out how to improve the value and lower the price and raise the quality. And historically using U.S. and Canada as 80% of our business first of all and probably 80ish and a little different than that number pretty close in terms of percent of members you have -- we have done a fee increase about every five or six years the last time we did was very late '11 very early '12. So most of the calendar year of '12 those renewals been a first time in five or six years saw the increase from 50 to 55 and from 100 to 110 on the executive in the U.S. and Canada if history repeats itself five to six years from January of '12 will be January of '17 into January of '18. So that again based on history it doesn\u2019t mean we are going to do it or not going to do it. We've chosen generally the whole membership fees at whatever their prices are mostly of the countries impart because it's so darn strong to start with and why not continue to drive the business. And so again I think it's generally the last thing we look at but something we've looked at regularly over 30 years and I'm sure we'll look at it again at and when time tends right. Paul Trussell : And then just circling back to gas profitability and I know you have addressed this a few times on the call, but given the spread between the Street's forecast and the actual for 2Q, I just wanted to touch back on your comments around the third quarter. You mentioned that gas prices have started to trickle back up, but frankly, can you help us just kind of think about our expectations for the back half of the year? Should it be closer to a more normalized cadence around gasoline profitability or do you continue to see a little bit of tailwind, given the favorable mix? Richard Galanti : Well if you look at history when we each quarter for the last several years we\u2019ll share with people that gas helped us a little hurt us a little helped us a lot hurt us a lot. It's virtually all -- it's pretty much in proportion with the trend of gas prices per gallon. And so as you know in the constant to drive down has stopped and went up a little bit. So a lot of that party is now behind us for right now and but I can't really tell you what is going to be other than historically that\u2019s what it's been. Operator : Your next question is line Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : First question relates to the special dividend. I guess this is our first conference call since you announced the last one. What the prior special dividend that was around the time of tax policy change and many companies pursued that tack. As you take a bigger picture look now at capital allocation, understanding that you did accelerate the stock buyback a bit, how are you thinking about special dividends, perhaps as a recurring element of capital allocation? And any other light you want to shed on your decision to issue that one last week? Richard Galanti : Well, I mean we now have two data points instead of one we did it and you're right the motivation or one of the motivations could be really the one we did it was reading about in the Wall Street Journal everyday and just before people expected a dividend tax rates is automatically, so it make sense to be not only shareholder friendly but shareholder friendly a way that might help people as well if tax rates were going to change and we feel active about that. I think we appreciated the fact that it was perceived as being shareholder friendly, as you might expect both management and the Board wanted to be in that regard and it's not like we sat down and did this giant study exactly when how much and what should we do, I think we liked it the first time and it seems like our shareholders liked it the second time. And that\u2019s how we clearly worry about it and there a little on dependent of each other. I think that when we did the first one which was a little over $3 billion worth it was quite sizeable it was a time when I guess in retrospect we could have bought some more stock back it have been a smart thing to do given where it's at now. We want to -- we tend to do both and we tend to look at all things, first and foremost CapEx, how through we ramp-up CapEx and we\u2019ve done that. Second would be our regular dividend, what are we going to do with that every year again there is no guarantees, but in each of the last spring periods over the last nine years I think we\u2019ve raised it on average around 13.5%. We looked as you know premiere models and our models we are generating more cash than we can use in CapEx and so we\u2019ll continue to look at ways to the shareholders run rate. But there is no reason of thinking that will be two year sense we\u2019ll do another one, there is always a thing we will mostly. Matthew Fassler : It's interesting even though you're running with several billion dollars of cash on the balance sheet, you haven't gotten to the debt markets, which I understand is opportunistic. Should we think about the cash balance that you have today as something that you feel you need to be comfortable with or is that a number that you could whittle down over time? Richard Galanti : I think it is a number that you wrote down mind you, I am looking at quarter end and this number might be a shade different than the balance sheet number, but I think we had cash and short-term investments was across this number there, hold on a second, cash in short-term investments at the end of the quarter of 7.4 billion roughly and add a number that wasn\u2019t completely consolidated of like 7.2, but if you look at that roughly 7.4 number about 2.5 is really cash in the U.S. another 2.5-3 is real cash outside the U.S. where we\u2019re spending it frankly. In addition we announced last year that we brought back some of the cash in Canada. So, I think we can withheld the number down but some of its cash equivalent, if you think about from the time base close on Friday night, so the time they open on Monday morning all those debit and credit card receivables which could be upwards of a $1 billion, $1.5 billion, 1 billion plus that is cash equivalent, but is not cash. Matthew Fassler : And then just a very quick follow-up, we are seeing the LIFO creep up. I know it's only a couple basis points, but it's a nice change from year ago, when, I guess, you peaked out at around 8 basis points hit. Could you just talk about what the moving pieces are in driving that? And I know you feel like you are fully marked at the end of any given quarter, but if you had to place bets on which direction it would go for the rest of the year, it would be very helpful? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t know, gas has come up a little bit, although it's still below where it was at the beginning of the year, so that is still probably LIFO as of today it is LIFO creditable, I don\u2019t think it's going to be a big giant number either way, but it's a little bit of attraction at this point. Yes, you were right about it Matt, a point of that is some proteins are inflationary right now for not always is related and some other things we\u2019re just starting to see what beginnings of some deflationary pressure on items manufactured in the oil, plastic bags and alike, so some of that is starting to finally flow through so there will be some things that are inflationary and some that are deflationary. Operator : Your next question is line Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Market. Kelly Bania : I am not sure if it's too early to ask this, but just curious about the members that you brought in via the Living Social promotion several months ago just curious if you are tracking them? Are they following that typical spending pattern of a new member in terms of spending and frequency? Richard Galanti : I'm going to plead because I don\u2019t know the answer to that, but we hold that question for next quarter I promise we'll have some numbers. I know that we're tracking it and I just don\u2019t have the detail on it. I know that on average, they're a little younger. I don\u2019t know spend habits. Kelly Bania : Then just another one, you mentioned the Bay Area as I think a strong region either in the quarter or for the month. I know that's an area where you have more robust offering in organics and I was just curious if that's part of it? And maybe how plans are to kind of bring that more robust organic offering to some more clubs in the rest of the country? Richard Galanti : Well and that's probably a little piece of it. I think weather overall has helped. The West Coast is as bad as it's been in Texas and the Midwest and the East Coast it's been offsettingly good over on our side of the country. And I'm sure that's helped some. Clearly I think some of the merchandising efforts we've done on organic have helped. Part of that, we are doing it more in other parts of the country. Part of it is supply issues and it will still take time for that to grow. Operator : Your next question is from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : I want to get back to e-commerce and maybe the ancillary services ex-gas and just explore I know I think you said that the margins are great. Did you give us a number on how big e-commerce is? Richard Galanti : No, it's -- do you mean total size of e-commerce? Scott Mushkin : Yes. Richard Galanti : It's about 3% of our total. Scott Mushkin : 3% of your total sales? Richard Galanti : Yes on an annualized basis, I think last year was like 2.9 or something, 3 billion and growing at 20%. Scott Mushkin : 3 billion growing 20%-25%. And then from a gross margin perspective, I mean that how do we think about SG&A associated with that business? Is there much of it? I mean is it like fractional a couple percent? I mean how do we think of SG&A when you look -- I know a lot of the stuff just goes directly to the consumer about 60% of it. Is there really a lot of SG&A associated? Richard Galanti : No there's -- margins are let me just look here, margins are a shade lower not a lot and SG&A is a lot lower. Scott Mushkin : And then from a philosophical perspective -- everyone has always ragged on or not ragged on that's a bad way to say it, everyone's always -- some people have criticized Costco because they don't let enough flow through to shareholders. How do we think about that? I think the gross margins are what you are saying are a little bit lower. SG&A is a lot lower, so net-net we got much better operating profit in the e-commerce business. Is that okay with the Company or is that something that you would try to make look like the rest of the business? Richard Galanti : No I mean we're a retailer, there's different part of it. No, we're happy to make a little more there. We're still making first and foremost are we as competitive as we can be relative to others and we feel that we are very competitive. We are also recognizing that e-commerce is supported by the buying sites of the warehouses as we brought in line electronics and furniture and some of those bigger ticket categories that buying strength, how do you compensate -- how does e-commerce if you will compensate to that so it's all part of the same thing. The fact it's margins overall are a little lower than the warehouses I think it's indicative -- it's a function of that and we'll continue to do that. We work on strong profits in some of the other ancillary businesses but they also have different either cost associated with it or purchasing powers. Pharmacies of course you got pharmacist and pharmacy techs that make more than average hourly employees, so you got a higher cost structure there as well as all the regulatory and billing stuff going on in that business so we work on a higher margin to offset some of that and but we also work on a profitability number that's good so it's all part of the equation if you will. Scott Mushkin : So then just one last one. So I think you said you are up to 8,000 SKUs. One of the things we think benefits Costco hugely on the e-commerce is that you are basically letting me use your people to do the shopping for me. In other words like the fact that there isn't 2 million skews like there is on Walmart's site I think is a great attribute. So what's your thought about where the SKU count goes, kind of balancing Costco being a personal shopper versus wanting more maybe more SKUs? Where do you think it goes? Richard Galanti : I think it probably goes up a little bit but not a lot, the fact that it went from 4,000 to 8,000 or something in the last few years is a lot, but part of that was just trying to drive business adding some categories to get people -- for people to think of it as top of mind or near top of mind instead of not at all. If I have to think about and comment from very loyal shareholder and somebody who loves Costco with three kids at home three teenagers and said look I love Costco and I know when I go into a warehouse I know I'm going to get the 10 items I planned to get in the food and sundries area and the other 10 that I didn\u2019t plan to get but I know I'm going to come out with 20 I'm going to be sated I know I'm going to have great food samples I know we have three other things in nonfood area that I have no plan to get and I'm excited about that but I knew going in I was going to get three items or four items that I didn\u2019t plan on getting. So I don\u2019t know why when do I go to costco.com so part of our challenge in the last year on costco.com is not only driving sales of those bigger physical ticket bigger dollar ticket and physical ticket items that not everybody wants to shop home like furniture and big screen TVs and had a great price and in many cases write about service delivery and we're driving that business. But also how we just did it more regularly and whether it's take ups in other items for your office or home or some apparel items. As you know the 5.5 million KS restaurants that we sell every year which is a great value if you always joked if you really tall with short runs we can assort you because we don\u2019t sell all the sizes and collar combinations online we do. So trying to get different reasons to get you under the state more often is part of the equation here and nothing we're doing pretty job of doing that. I don\u2019t see and you said Richard you're taking again 15,000 one day I don\u2019t see it in my near future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Oliver Chen : I just had a bigger picture question about holiday. Did you have -- would you prioritize any major learnings from holiday in terms of where you might look to do things differently next year? And then on the core merchandising margins number, what should we look at as helpful drivers for that positively going forward? Or what kind of run rate might we expect there? Thank you. Richard Galanti : What's the second part of that question? Oliver Chen : The core merchandise margins. What are some of the positive drivers we should look for in terms of optimism on the core merchandise margins, whether it be inventory control. Or is the run rate at a slight negative kind of realistic for us to model? Richard Galanti : We didn\u2019t say we don\u2019t provide on the latter part we don\u2019t provide specific direction on that area. I remember several years ago when our margins were just down year-over-year every quarter for a couple of years and every quarter we'd say margins are fine. We can tweak them a little bit if we want and where we want to I think that sentence and that response is still there I think we continue to get excited by strong sales and strong loyalty and strong conversion to executive member. And all those things will continue to take front seat to a little margin improvement. But if we want to get a little bit we think we can while still being very competitive. In terms of what do we learn or not learn during the holiday. I think when we look back I think we did a pretty good job of planning for the port slowdowns and arguably it's probably easier to do a better job when you're managing fewer items. And so while we felt that we got hurt by a little bit I think we probably mitigated that hurt. Beyond that again I think we are comfortable when raw materials, prices, and bakery and food court and the alike go up that we're not going to change our prices and if it hurt our margin a little bit it hurts it we can get elsewhere. So I don\u2019t think this was given our strength we didn\u2019t they weren\u2019t a lot of things to necessary learn as it relates to did sales soften and we drive more sales by more mark down just something I think we thought we had came out of this season pretty good. And if anything continues to be aggressive in terms of price of the products the price points of products that our member wants great value or great items and we'll continue to drive the value proposition in upscale items. Oliver Chen : And inventories were nicely growing versus the sales, like underpinning sales. Is that a trend we should also model going forward in terms of the spread being neutral? Richard Galanti : Probably a little bit again I wouldn\u2019t read too much into one quarter. For a number of years here we've generally again taking FX gas out of it the four walls of warehouse inventories that on a non-FX diluted or increased basis. Generally speaking we've had sales greater than inventory per warehouse increases if sales were up 8 or 9 inventories were up five or six. I think my guess is Q2 was a little better than we thought but it not's going to drive a little bit but still trending in a positive ratio there. Oliver Chen : In our last question, you gave a lot of great details on the e-commerce and the evolution there. What about flexible store fulfillment and reserve and pick up and ship from store. Is that on the horizon? Is it something your customer appreciates and will that be a material driver of traffic? At some competitors, e-com contributes 100 basis points or more to comp. Richard Galanti : Well 23% of growth on 3 billion is like 60 or whatever 500 million. So that\u2019s like little under half a percent of comp to the company. First of all we don\u2019t do it right now with the exception of the 8 or 9 Costco business centers that we have that we both to delivered and order for pick up several things we\u2019re testing like Google and the cart are something enhancement, it's not like you can\u2019t call Costco, or online Costco and say I want to order this stuff and I\u2019ll come and pick it up. So, I don\u2019t know if our member appreciates it, I know there is a lot of effort out they are doing it, our first order business is get -- we just are installing the membership module which includes a lot of hooks to things, but I don\u2019t see us doing that certainly in the next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : One, have you seen any evidence that gas prices correlate either to customers' willingness to spend more on food, sundries, and hardlines in your stores or your ability to sign up more members at your Clubs when gas prices are either moving up or moving down? Richard Galanti : Well, it used to be when prices were moving up and it was the topic du jour every night on the -- from the consumer product and the consumer activist on the local news station, when were prices were skyrocketing is when we saw some real signups related to in that market. Conversely you see less of that right now, certainly we\u2019re seeing and the answer is I don\u2019t know completely, but certainly we\u2019re seeing more traffic to the gas stations, more and continued strong shopping frequency in the four walls of the warehouse and some of that\u2019s got to be related that but I couldn\u2019t tell you how much. Michael Lasser : And my second question is on the credit card. Can you give us a sense of what the private-label credit card penetration is in your Clubs? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t think we disclosed that, total credit card, in U.S. total credit card is about 40, debit is about 40, cash, check and other is about 20. Michael Lasser : But presumably a big portion is private label? Richard Galanti : Probably and certainly more than half but there are people that choose even using our credit thing, there are people that choose to get star reward points or drop the points on a different AMEX card than the Costco one. Our goal though is to certainly drive more of it and we have successfully historically and hope we can do that in the future to drive more of it to this top of the wallet card. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. There is no response form that line, we\u2019ll move to the next question. Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Nomura. Bob Drbul : Just have two questions for you. The first one is when you look at the impact of FX this quarter throughout the P&L, can you just help us understand a little better, like what we should expect both on MFI and on SG&A over the coming quarters as we look at the foreign exchange where we are today? And the second question is, with gas prices rising a bit over the past few weeks, are you adjusting the merchandise pricing that quickly to reflect the movement in gas, as you were opportunistic this quarter. With gas prices going up, will you change things as we go into the next few weeks, given the rising prices? Richard Galanti : The answer to last one is no and again I am not -- I can\u2019t tell you how exactly what, when, where and how, but did it give us a little bit of cover to be aggressive? Yes. Did it give us a lot? No, it gave us a lot of cover, but we choose not use it. So, I mean it's not like we\u2019re going to say, hey, let's take all this and go use it. So yes, as gas profits come down that was probably our improvement, it so happen in this quarter where is that pointed out all those other things, some of which we will continue doing it, you guys can figure out FX based on where the currencies of each country are. If it weakens a little bit relative to dollar from a year ago, it is a little more impactful, if it weakens little less, it's a less gradual but still with a negative front of it. Yes, interest income and others that little bit of a crapshoot. It goes both ways. Gas now is going to be less outsize profitable in the coming quarters and there is another reason hopefully that sales will continue to drive in the right direction. I think overall, I look at Q2 and taking all the good of gas out and the negatives and sort of other things some of that will go away in Q3, but if we can drive sales frequently we\u2019ll be fine. I am going to take two more calls. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Melich with Evercore ISI. Gregory Melich : Two questions, one is -- and I realize there's a lot of moving pieces, but if you were to look at gas and how much that helps EPS this quarter, could you give a range or if it was $0.10. And then sort of think about it going forward, if gas was steady, is that something you have to cycle, it comes back, or is it something that is a new plan? And then my other question was on gross margin. I think I heard you say that in ancillary, there was pharmacy and maybe something else where there was some margin expansion. Could you help explain that, if I heard that right? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Sure we're not going give specifics on gas it was very profitable a little bit of it could be an offset to other margins a lot of it is just outsized but then we also had a few other things that went the other way and so that outsize this was a little less outside. In terms of gross margin optical and hearing aids again just looking just like I say in the core gas was the big one but several other key businesses, ancillary businesses also had slightly improving margins year-over-year pharmacy optical and hearing aid. Gregory Melich : And what drove that? Was there a mix issue or --? Richard Galanti : I think some of it is driving sales a big chunk of it driving sales I think on hearing aids and I'm guess here because I don\u2019t know our success of purple signature which is a incredible value and quality I am told that the penetration that\u2019s huge generally we make more margin and save the customer more money on our private label. But I'm guessing it that way. Gregory Melich : And I guess just because it is linked a little bit, where are we now with inflation for the whole store? If you were to roll it together? Does it meet enough in electronics now and all that kind of stuff? Richard Galanti : Year-to-date we're about a 0.5% deflationary and that\u2019s a LIFO index for U.S. inventory, so what we're all like items cost update one of the fiscal year and one of these same items cost us on day 180 or so whatever this year and if day one it was 100.00 at the end of 24 weeks it was 0.995 so literally 0.5% you had a little bit of inflation in for sundries and apparel and domestics. You had deflation as you expect in majors you had deflation in gas and you had deflation in foods a little bit sundries are up a little food was down a little. Gregory Melich : That\u2019s tough. Richard Galanti : Not a lot of deflation. Operator : And your final question comes from line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory. Joe Feldman : Wanted to just ask about international for a moment, I think you have been in Spain now for about a year. Just was curious for a little update there, update on what you are thinking about new countries. I believe France was going to be next. And also just more generally, just store productivity. When you are opening internationally, are you still kind of achieving and exceeding the targets that you have set out? Richard Galanti : In Asia and Australia historically achieved and exceeded recognizing whenever you are in a new country. And as go back I use to depend as an example 15, 18 years ago 15 years. Our original plan there was over a unit a year for five years and just achieved breakeven at the end of your five I think we ended up opening six in five years and we achieved breakeven at the end of year four roughly. And a lot of that has do with you have got a 5 plus million plus a year net on central expense, buyers, and carry department. Small IT department you name it and then of course all the efficiencies are starting up memberships wide were doing great in Spain. We have one unit mind you sales wise we're under our plan but it's starting to finally grow nicely. I think now that we're here to say we've got two openings planned for the rent remaining part of this calendar year both of them are in the mid grid area and one in September and one is later that year. I think that both in the fall and again what we find even if it's a different city once we're there you start getting more local vendors willing to sell you because we're going be around and you get a little more play in the press. Yes we'll see but we feel good about going so far, France we\u2019re still at least a year away for opening I think when we first set down four or so years ago the view was is that Spain would take three to five years and France would take three to eight years and it is. So it is a long run out process of permitting and the whole appeals process over there by third-parties. Richard Galanti : Well thank you and I thank you for listening for an hour and a half. And have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO, you may begin your conference. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Britney. Good morning to everyone. Last night\u2019s press release presented our third quarter operating results for the 12 weeks ended May 10, 2015. Before I begin, please note that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. So to begin with, our 12-week third quarter fiscal 2015 operating results for the quarter, earnings per share came in at $1.17 a share, a 9% increase over last year\u2019s third quarter earnings results of $1.07 a share. Couple of factors that impacted our third quarter earnings comparison year-over-year. First, FX; as compared to a year ago, in the third quarter this year, the foreign currencies where we operate weakened versus the U.S. dollar, in fact in all countries, but primarily in Canada, Mexico, Korea and Japan, resulting in our foreign earnings in Q3 when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $33 million pre-tax or $0.06 a share than these earnings would have been had FX rates been flat year-over-year. Second item of note, IT modernization. As with the past many quarter, our major IT modernization efforts are ongoing and will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expense percentages through this fiscal year and certainly into next year, especially as new major systems are placed into service and depreciation on those being. And in Q3, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by an estimated $19 million pre-tax or 5 basis points without gas deflation and FX. A third note, LIFO. Last year in Q3, we recorded a $12 million pre-tax LIFO charge. This year in Q3, we had a $7 million pre-tax LIFO credit, which benefited Q3 this year by $0.01 a share. And last item of note, while we enjoyed the benefit of strong year-over-year gross [ph] profits in the first half of the fiscal year, both Q1 and Q2, in Q3 it was additive, but only by $0.01 a share, so pretty much back to normal this quarter although the next quarter will be a little bit of a tougher comparison. In terms of sales for the third quarter, total sales were up 1% and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure came in at down 1%. For the quarter, sales were negatively impacted as you all know by gasoline price deflation. That represented about 350 basis point negative impact and by weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar year-over-year. That impact was a little over 300 basis points. So excluding gas, the reported plus 1% U.S. comp number increase in Q3 would have been a plus 5% and the reported minus 6% international comp figure excluding gas and FX impacts would have been plus 7%. Such that the total company comps reported at minus 1% for the quarter excluding gas and FX would have been plus 6% for the company. One other item of note on sales, looking at some of the preliminary reports by analysts out there, it looks like the suggestion was that May might have gotten off to a weak start. That\u2019s not the case. The first couple of weeks of May are just fine. And in terms of new openings, after nine new locations in the first half of fiscal 2015, including the relocation of Wayne, New Jersey, we opened four locations in Q3, one in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, one in Merida, Mexico, which was a relocation, and one in Culiac\u00e1n, Mexico. And we also converted our existing Bedford Park, Illinois warehouse into a business center. So a net of two additional locations in the third quarter. All told, that puts our fiscal 2015 opening schedule so far through the third quarter at 10 net new locations. Next week kicks off a very buys fiscal fourth quarter expansion, which includes openings next week in Wichita, Kansas, Mobile, Alabama, and Rochester, New York. These are the first three of 14 planned new locations for the fourth quarter, including four additional new U.S. locations, one new location in each UK, Taiwan, Korea, and Mexico, and three new warehouses opening in Japan this August. We will most likely end the fiscal year with 24 net new openings and 687 Costcos worldwide. We had originally planned to be closer to 30 for the fiscal year. However, several of these have been pushed into early fiscal 2016 due to timing and construction issues. In fact, between September 1 and the end of the calendar year 2015 or the first four months of fiscal 2016, we expect to open somewhere between 15 and 18 new warehouses. So a very busy seven-month period ahead for us. Also this morning, I'll review with you our e-commerce activity, our membership trends and renewal rates, our recent common stock repurchase and dividend activities and of course additional discussion about margins, SG&A and other items in Q3. So for our third quarter results, in terms of sales, sales for this year\u2019s third quarter for the 12 weeks ended May 10 were $25.52 billion, up 1% from last year\u2019s third quarter results of $25.23 billion. On a reported comp basis, Q3 comps were down 1%, but up 6% excluding gas deflation and FX. For the quarter, our minus 1% reported comp was a combination of an average frequency increase of about 3.5% and an average transaction decrease of minus 4% for the quarter recognizing that that minus 4% is reported excluding FX and gas that 4% average transaction would have been plus 2.5%. In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region \u2013 excuse me, in terms of sales by geographic region for the U.S., the Midwest and California were the strongest. Internationally in local currencies Australia, Mexico and Taiwan posted the strongest results. In terms of merchandize categories sales performance for the quarter, in the third quarter, within food and sundries, overall low to mid singles, deli low reported, mid if you take the FX out. Deli and frozen were the relative standouts. For hardlines, the departments with the strongest results were hardware and garden. Consumer electronics comps were slightly positive, excluding FX. Within the low single-digit softlines comps men\u2019s apparel and housewares were the standouts, and in fresh foods meat and deli were the strongest. Now moving to the line items of the income statement, membership fees we came in at $584 million or 2.29% that\u2019s a 4% increase and a 7 basis points increase and a $23 million increase versus last year\u2019s third quarter. Again these numbers are impacted of course by FX. The $584 million number FX has been flat year-over-year at 4% dollar increase would have been 7%, up instead of 4% reporting. In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, 91% in the U.S. and Canada, and 88% worldwide and also continuing increased penetration of our executive membership. New member signups in the third quarter were slightly down year-over-year; this has to do essentially with timing of four openings in Asia last year, two in Japan, and two in Korea, which generate typically larger than normal sign-ups. In terms of number of members at Q3 end, Gold Star 33.2 million at Q3 end, which is up from 32.7 million 12 weeks earlier at Q2 end; primary business, the same at 7.0 million; business add-ons, the same at 3.5 million. So all told, we ended the quarter with 43.7 million member households up from 43.2 million and including extra cards 79.6 million at Q3 end versus 78.7 million just 12 weeks earlier. At May 10 Q3 end, paid executive members came in at 15.7 million, an increase of just about 250,000 since Q2 end or about 21,000 a week increase in the quarter. As I\u2019ve stated before executive members continue to grow, they are currently approximately 36% of our member base and approximately two-thirds of our sales. In terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned business continues strong rounding up to 95%, Gold Star around 90% and so total within the 91% and Worldwide 88%. Our reported gross margin for the quarter was up on a reported basis up 47 basis points from a 10.62% this last year up to 11.09% this year. And that 47 basis point increase is a plus 9 basis point increase without gas deflation. If you jot down a few numbers as I always ask you to do, we will have four columns. The first two columns will be first half of 2015 as reported. Second column will be first half of 2015 without gas deflation, and then Q3 2015 and Q3 2015 [ph] reported and without gas deflation for the third and fourth columns. The line items, first one would be core merchandizing, the first half reported we were up 2 basis points and the first half without gas deflation it was down 17 basis points. For Q3 reported was plus 23 and without gas deflation minus 10. Ancillary businesses plus 34 and plus 29 for the first half, and for the third quarter plus 23 reported and plus 15 without gas, 2% reward minus 3 and minus 1 and for the quarter minus 6 and minus 3. LIFO, plus 2 and plus 2 and for the quarter-on-quarter plus 7 and plus 7, other was plus 3 and plus 3 for the first half and zero and zero for the third quarter. Anyway for total, for the first half we were up 38 basis points and without gas deflation up 16 and reported for the third quarter we were up 47 and as I just mentioned plus 9 on a without gas deflation basis. Now again as you can see when these numbers, core merchandising gross margin was up 23 basis points year-over-year and down 10 without gas deflation, this is primarily a function of improved year-over-year gross margins within our ancillary businesses. The core gross margins in food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods as a percentage of their own sales were up 10 basis points year-over-year with food and sundries and softlines being up year-over-year and hardlines and fresh foods being down year-over-year, but the net of the four on their own sales was up 10 basis points, so a good margin performance in the quarter. Ancillary and other business grows margins were up 23 and 15 without gas deflation in the third quarter. We basically enjoyed fairly broad based strength within all of our ancillary businesses with year-over-year gross margin improvements in gas optical hearing aids and food courts, as well as proved year-over-year sales penetration within pharmacy commerce and travel, which all contributed to the ancillary gross margin improvement. The impact from sales to our executive membership represents a 6 basis point hit to the margin or 3 basis point hit without gas deflation. This is good, it is the 2% reward feature, which reduces sales and the fact is it is more members switched to executive member, we think that\u2019s good for us long term. LIFO as I mentioned $7 million pre-tax benefit this year, compared to $12 million pretax charge last year. For a $19 million or 7 basis point year-over-year positive earnings gross margin. As I\u2019ve said many times whether these numbers are up or down on LIFO it is really part of the margin in my view. Overall, we think margins are in good shape. Moving to reported SG&A, our SG&A percentages in Q3 year-over-year were higher by 25 basis points coming in at 10.1% of sales this year, compared to a 9.86% in last year\u2019s third quarter, but again better or lower by 10 basis points, excluding gas deflation. In terms of SG&A again, we will do the same four columns, first half 2015, both reported and without gas deflation and Q3 2015 both reported and without gas deflation. First is operations, we were plus 6, and plus means good or lower, plus 6 reported and plus 23 without gas deflation in the first half year-over-year. We were minus 16 and plus 14 without gas deflation, the plus 14. Central minus 6 and minus 4 for the first half and minus 10 and minus 6 for the third quarter reported without gas deflation. Stock compensation minus 8 and minus 7 in the first half and plus 1 and plus 2 for the third quarter. Quarterly adjustments were not an issue, it was zero all across the board. In total, we reported for the first half minus 8 basis points or higher by 8 basis points and when factor was better or lower by 12 basis points or plus 12, reported for the third quarter was minus 25 basis points or higher by 25, again lower or plus 10 basis point without gas deflation. The operations component again was a minus 16. Within operations, excluding gas deflation, pay roll and benefits represented 10 basis point of that year-over-year improvement. So good expense control on payroll and stuff. The benefits, our central expense was higher year-over-year in the third quarter by 10, 6 without deflation. Again IT monetization represented about 7 of that or 5 without gas deflation in FX, so that\u2019s a big chunk of that. Equity compensation little bit of a benefit there. That fluctuate is based on when people high their 25, 30 or 35 year tenures where some of those are accelerated as well as of course every October we do the annual grant. Next on the income statement line is pre-opening expense, no real big issues here. $16 million last year in the quarter $14 million this year. So, lower by \u2013 this expense item lower by $2 million. We had four openings in each of Q3 2014 and Q3 2015. All told, operating income for the third quarter came in at $821 million higher by $84 million or 11% from last year\u2019s operating income figure of $737 million. Below the operating income line interest expense came in at $31 million this year versus $25 million during last year\u2019s fiscal quarter. This increase is a result of the billion dollars of senior notes issued during the second quarter in conjunction with the recent $5 per share special dividend. Interest income in other was lower year-over-year by about $3 million coming in at $9 million this year versus $12 million a year ago in the quarter. Actual interest income for the quarter was lower by \u2013 a million of that $3 million was actual interest income. The other component is principally, which is about minus 2 million year-over-year, this principally relates to marking to market forward FX contracts used by our foreign operations, sometimes that\u2019s positive by a little, sometimes that\u2019s negative, pretty small negative this time. These swings are caused by the change in the U.S. dollar relative in those currencies. Overall, pretax income was higher by little over 10% year-over-year or higher by $75 million in the third quarter coming in from last year\u2019s $724 million in the quarter to this year\u2019s $799 million. In terms of income taxes, our company tax rate this quarter came in right at 35.0%; that compares to 33.9% last year in the third quarter. Compared to last year our effective tax rate has gone up due to lower year-over-year percentages of earnings coming from our foreign operations. This lower penetration is primarily due to foreign exchange, as well as strong U.S. gas profits compared to last year although they are only slightly stronger. Overall, reported net income of $516 million this year in the third quarter represented a 9% increase as compared to the $473 million net income figure last year in Q3. Now for a quick rundown of other usual topics. The balance sheet of course is included in this morning\u2019s press release, but a couple of balance sheet info items. Accounts payable as a percent of inventories reported was 100%, up from 99% a year ago. Payables of course in that number include construction payables, not just merchandize payables. If you look at just merchandize payables against inventories this year, it was also up 1%, a little better \u2013 at 90% this year versus 89% a year ago. Average inventories per warehouse were up on a reported basis about $180,000, coming in at $13.2 million per location versus $13.0 million a year ago, up about 1%, but again FX \u2013 without FX, inventory levels per warehouse if FX had been flat year-over-year would have been up about $570,000 or up about 4% per warehouse. This increase was pretty much spread over many departments, some of which had resulted from the increased flow of backlogged inventories from the West Coast port slowdown. That\u2019s pretty much behind us and we should see some \u2013 a little of that burn off. Overall, our inventories are just fine as I mentioned in the second quarter earnings report, midyear fiscal inventories came in as good as they ever have. In terms of CapEx, in the first quarter, we spent $555 million; in Q2, an additional $612 million; and in Q3, $421 million, so for a year-to-date total of CapEx of $1.6 billion. Given that a couple of units have been pushed into the fall, current estimate for CapEx this year is somewhere in the $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. That compares to last year\u2019s fiscal 2014 expenditures for the whole fiscal year of right at $2.0 billion. In terms of Costco Online, we continue to operate it in four countries \u2013 U.S., Canada, UK, and Mexico. For the third quarter, sales and profit were up nicely. Sales were up 18% in U.S. dollars for the quarter. And again excluding FX, our e-commerce business in local currencies, sales were up 21%. Next on the discussion list, expansion. As I mentioned, in terms of net new openings, we opened eight in Q1, none in Q2, two in Q3, and 14 anticipated for Q4 net. So that would be 24 net increase for the year. And as I mentioned, somewhere in the 15 to 18 more in the first four months of \u2013 the last four months of calendar 2015, which will be the first four months of fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2015, again, these 24 will represent about a little over a 3.5% unit increase, so probably about a 4% square footage increase. And at Q3 end, we ended with total square footage of 96.7 million square feet. In terms of common stock repurchases, in Q1, we started buying back a little again at $18 million in purchases in Q2, it was $92 million in purchase for that 12-week quarter and for the third quarter that 12-week quarter, we did $124 million in purchases having purchased about 839,000 shares. So, again, in terms of an annualized basis, we are doing more in Q3 than we had in the previous two quarters. Year-to-date, 234 million shares. In terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend per share increased with the May dividend payment from 35.5% to $0.40 a share for the quarter, 12.7% increase. This $1.60 a share annualized dividend represents the total cost to the company right at $700 million a year. This regular dividend of course was an addition to the $5 a share special dividend, which totaled $2.2 billion to our shareholders that was paid on February 27. It was announced in Q2, but paid in the beginning of Q3. Lastly, next week on Wednesday, June 3, after the market closes, we will announce our sales results for the month of May, the four weeks ending Sunday, May 31. As well, our fourth quarter scheduled earnings release will be Wednesday, September 30, after market close at 6 PM Pacific Time. The earnings conference call will occur the following morning. And with that, Britney, I will turn it back over to you for Q&A. Thank you. Operator : You are welcome. [Operator Instructions] Your first question does come from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. John Heinbockel : So, Richard, two questions about gross margin. Number one, so the guest benefit moderated, but you still had a pretty good performance out of ancillary, so were there some other non-gas ancillary departments that were particularly robust, really up quite a bit in gross? That is number one. And then two, if you look at sort of core merchandise right ex deflation, so you are still down there, I know you are making \u2013 I think you're making some investments. Can you talk about how you think about tying gasoline windfall or gasoline benefit or ancillary benefit to investments in price and is one of those the idea of pass along less meat inflation because you\u2019ve got some gas wind at your back? Richard Galanti : First of all, all the ancillary businesses were good this quarter. They generally have been good. I mean sometimes one is a little lower year-over-year but it hit all, we are up. Gas was a very small benefit year-over-year this quarter of gas profits versus the first two quarters as we mentioned in those first two quarters. And again that will cycle over the next three quarters when we had strong Q4 a year ago and strong Q1 and Q2 earlier this year, so those could be tougher comparisons. In terms of investing in price, I mean that\u2019s what we do. It\u2019s not a scientific function here. It\u2019s an art form and we are always going to be competitive. Frankly I can remember over the past several years when we talked about just when poultry prices were skyrocketing there were some fiscal years when just that one item was $30 million or $40 million of margin reduction year-over-year \u2013 you know, $0.05 or $0.06 a share to the company, when we had no gas impact. So we do what we do when we do it when it is the right thing to do for our company from a competitive standpoint. Certainly having strong gas profits makes it a little easier, but I wouldn't say \u2013 we don't use a certain percentage of \u2013 certainly don't use all of it, but certainly don't use some fixed percentage either. We do what we do each quarter in all of the competitive environment. I think I answered all your questions. Did I miss anything? John Heinbockel : Well, just curious about meat, meat in particular has been very inflationary. It is a big category for you. That strikes me that that is one where you may have delayed putting some pricing through. Richard Galanti : Yeah, well, but that\u2019s such a front and center category, when you see ads in the paper every week particularly holiday weekends for Memorial Day or July 4th or Christmas or Labor Day, you name it, and so we are always going to be tough on that. Historically when commodity prices are going up, we are the first to not have them go up as much and when they are coming down, we are going to go down as fast as we can. I think one thing that has helped offset it a little bit over the last few years is in this tough economy, we are the ones \u2013 I remember right after the economy got hammered in late 2008, there were some fiscal quarters and calendar years 2009 and 2010 where we were upwards of a third of all the prime meat sold in the United States when usually that was nothing or very little because it all goes to restaurants and hotels. So we have a customer that when prices come down we can sell it and that kind of stuff. And on organic, we can protect our margin a little bit because everybody else is trying to make more and we try to make fair. So all those things. By the way, the other comment \u2013 the question you asked earlier about the core being down 10, it is, recognizing core margin on core sales was up 10. The fact of the matter is all these things there is 12 buttons that you have to push in and this one pushes that one out as it relates to what is going on penetration wise, sales penetration wise. So again, we are never going to \u2013 we are going to do what we do competitively first and foremost and knock on wood at the end of the day, it comes out pretty good. John Heinbockel : All right. And then just lastly again on the topic of mix here, so if you think about KS, just remind us the margin spread and I know it will vary by item, but margin spread KS versus a branded product, KS penetration and then is the KS margin itself staying pretty flat over time as you get a benefit you pass it along or is KS margin actually getting a little bit better? Richard Galanti : Yeah, of core merchandise, Kirkland Signature is about a quarter of our sales and increasing. Hopefully it will continue to increase to some higher level. I would say again if I think back of some of the big volume items, paper goods, we have some KS on order, we have some KS items that are several hundred million dollars or more of sales a year. Some of the low hanging fruit originally was those are typically very competitive branded items where we can show a great savings and still make a better margin. It ranges all over the board. The difference between KS margin and branded margin could be sometimes as much as half a dozen percentage points and sometimes 1, 0 to 2. So \u2013 and really again, and probably that\u2019s price point driven, you know if the if the right margin and something was, I mean to get to some margin percentage was right 11.39 you can well bet it\u2019s going to be 10.99, but when it goes the other way, we\u2019re not going to go up past some percentage point because we're pretty disciplined in that. So overall, I don't think \u2013 if it\u2019s changed, it\u2019s changed very little because most of those, the big wide ones have been done so many years ago. So, now the only extra of that is just a little extra penetration, but I would say that's a declining, probably a slightly declining penetration because new stuff is all over the board in different items. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. Good morning Richard. One follow-up on gas, this quarter it looked like there was a slightly different dynamic at play where wholesale prices were rising different from the prior to, you got retail prices went up a bit \u2013 national prices, right I don't know how your prices trended, but you still eked out a little bit of a benefit, did you do anything different to manage it, did you typically lag, I guess the market, but where you more cognizant of the interplay between wholesale cost and retail prices this quarter? Richard Galanti : Nothing out of the ordinary, no. Simeon Gutman : Okay and then my follow-up is on investments in SG&A spending, I think we asked this once a quarter, regarding the timing in terms of when investments crest and when we should start to see those investments dwindle? Richard Galanti : In terms of IT? Simeon Gutman : Correct. Richard Galanti : Yeah, I think if I go back two and a half years ago, we felt that probably sometime in early 2016, maybe I\u2019m off by half a year or a year, so maybe still longer, but good news is the denominator in that calculation keeps getting higher to the sales denominator, but we're just starting to see some of those big projects and we've got several of them. The installed and that's when you start that amortization of those items. So we will still see it eke up a little bit over the next \u2013 certainly the next four quarters maybe six, it's hard to predict maybe it\u2019s seven, I don't know yet, but it\u2019s going as planned and part of the plan in a tongue-in-cheek way was whatever we think it\u2019s going to be, it\u2019s going to be a little more. Simeon Gutman : And when you said 2016 are you referring to calendar or fiscal? Richard Galanti : Well, I\u2019m referring to fiscal, but it could be a little longer than that, but if it is, it\u2019s coming down as, these are smaller in my view, smaller, they\u2019re going to be smaller year-over-year higher SG&A basis points than they have been, but you will have to wait and see guys. Things are going along, knocked on with the things we have installed so far, each time we install something we're getting better than the last installation, but as with this IT stuff it takes a little longer than we originally planned. Simeon Gutman : Okay thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Meredith Adler : Hi Meredith Adler from Barclays. Hi Richard, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of inflation in chicken and eggs because of avian flu? Richard Galanti : No I don't know completely, I do know that there was requirement in California in terms of something related to eggs that caused egg prices to come up and if you want to follow-up with me, I am happy to find out, I just don't know on the top of my head. Meredith Adler : Well then more theoretically, I do actually, it has to do with giving the birds, the hens bigger cages and that meant there was a shortage of supply, I learned that from another retailer yesterday, but what is your philosophy about chickens and rotisserie chicken pricing if you see a big increase are you going to do what you've done before, which is just maintain your retail price? Richard Galanti : Well I\u2019ll proceed, I can only tell you what history has shown us, is that when others were raising their chicken prices from 4.99 to 5.99 we were willing to \u2013 if eat if you will $30 million, $40 million a year in gross margin by keeping it at 4.99 and that's what we do for a living. Meredith Adler : Can you talk also just more generally about food inflation both in the U.S. and outside the U.S.? Richard Galanti : On the protein site it\u2019s been involved for various reasons, pork was volatile because of a virus that reduced the supply. The beef was, as I understand in an 18 month transition where grain prices when feed prices skyrocketed, certain part of that 18 month cycle of growing cattle was reduced as people, as farmers sent them to process sooner because it was too much, it cost too much to feed them. And so we are going through that cycle of limited inventory there and then there is also higher demand overseas, which has been muted a little bit by the stronger dollar. So, again it is just like predicting anything you never know what it is going to be until it gets there. When I look overall, looking just down the list of the most deflationary and inflationary items in the last month, you've got some beef items on there for sure and that's 8% to 20% range year-over-year. On the deflationary side, again it is all over the board there is some \u2013 nothing that stands out in terms of big trends. So, I think overall proteins are up a little more than they have been three and six months ago in terms of that expectation and the expectation, the, I will pick up comment from one of our senior buyers on the fresh foods, on the pork, beef, and poultry sidewise as they come down a little bit you can be assured that they will go back up and as they go up a little bit you can be sure they will come back down. So, again it is hit and missed, when I get back to my comment, I made earlier in this call, when prices are, when these types of prices are going up, we're going to try to hold off as long as we can and when they are going down, rest assured we are going to be the first out there lowering them, but it is a very competitive field out there. We are benefiting, I think a little bit with the increasing organic and fresh foods in general not necessarily protein, but I think that trend of benefiting from that will \u2013 should continue from the standpoint that there is more supply of organic out there. Meredith Adler : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah, good morning. This is Stephen at Cowen on for Oliver today, thanks for taking our questions. Looking at international, can you provide an update where you guys are versus your long-term potential, you know currently international is about 30% of your star base, could that get to 50% over time and then we understand you know France is the next country you guys are going to enter, any other new markets you are looking to consider? Richard Galanti : Well international is going to be most likely continue to grow if you think about it on a base of about 480 U.S. we are opening 12 or 14 year this year and about half in the US half International where that number of openings internationally on a smaller basis of total international right now is a lot bigger and that will continue and I think even the percentage of annual openings each year will continue to grow outside of the US as we, as that is limited. If anything I would probably was as our expectations five years ago that is probably more opening then we had anticipated so that is good news from the US but we will still but we will see still seeing more grow internationally, could it be 50-50 one day, probably, I'm not sure when but it will keep growing. Unidentified Analyst : Okay and then just and then I guess like specific we would like to get your views on the competitive environment, you know some of your traditional warehouse competitors are struggling and then conversely there is a lot of new grocery concepts that are emerging, how do you guys see the environment changing and then do you think there's an opportunity for Costco to eventually have a, you know like a new store concept or a modified store concept, thanks very much. Richard Galanti : Well it\u2019s always a competitive field, I mean there is some great supermarket changes out there both nationally and regionally, we still respect our direct competitors. I think, one of the good things about our concept from my view is that I look at organic, it started off small, it is still small relative by growing faster and there is certainly more supply of that out there and it\u2019s where we shine in terms of quality and value and I think that\u2019s nothing but a positive for us going forward at this point. I don't see us doing, you know many years ago we tried a smaller box size concept in the 72,000 foot range compared to the \u2013 probably back then the average Costco was in the 135, 140, we are building Costco\u2019s in the 155 range now, in terms of thousand square feet. I don't see us trying a smaller box anytime in the near future because we got plenty going on with the regular sized box. I mentioned on the call earlier we converted the Bedford, Illinois unit from a warehouse club to a business center, that\u2019s our 10th business center. I think the last five of those 10 business centers over the last four or so year \u2013 five years, we will probably open a couple of three of those a year going forward as they have started to perform better, but again we will see. That is pretty much what we have going on at this point and so far so good. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee. John Parker : Good morning. This is actually John Parker on for Chuck. I guess can we dig into the core margins by category a little bit and I mean it seems like the 10 basis point improvement as a percentage of owned sales is the best in a few quarters. So kind of what drove that performance I guess in the food and sundries and softlines categories? Richard Galanti : Yes, well, again food and sundries, softlines was bigger improvement year-over-year than food and sundries. In fact, I don't remember if it is because it was a weak comparison to last year. Foods has a much bigger penetration mind you. Food and sundries is our biggest core category. And there is nothing specific. Again I think that we feel that we are able to make a little more margin mostly by buying better and keeping a little of it but passing more of it on. When we look at our competitive [indiscernible] versus our direct competitors if anything the gap is improving, it is getting bigger a little bit, not a lot. So it is not like \u2013 and so in our view we are as if not more competitive while still showing some improvement in the core. But as many of you know who have known us for a long time, we could make a little more if we wanted to and sometimes if we need to and sometimes if we need to we don't because it\u2019s the right thing to do. So I think we feel at this point quite comfortable with where our margins have been and hopefully that will continue. John Parker : Got it. Thanks. And then just switching gears a little bit, can you provide an update on some of the digital initiatives you guys are doing like e-commerce, Tmall with Alibaba, Google Express and Instacart? Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, pretty much the same as a quarter ago. We are certainly testing in six markets with Google and probably a few other merchants with Google, the Google Express Shopping. Instacart has expanded to more cities with their announced capital raise a few months ago. And there's a couple of other smaller ones in some regional markets and so that is good. We are agnostic. We are working with all of them. We like to sell merchandize and we will see where it goes. In terms of Tmall, I think we've got about 160 items on there and it\u2019s doing quite well. We don't disclose numbers on it, it\u2019s still small of course. But I would say certainly significantly better than we expected to start with. And the good news is it\u2019s getting our name known over there and as more stuff is shipped in, and more to Kirkland Signature name than the Costco name frankly and that\u2019s good too. In terms of other digital initiatives, I know we did one thing in one of our smaller regional markets with Groupon, but relatively small, good results, but small impact, a small geographic impact and that is pretty much it at this point. We plan an e-commerce \u2013 again, we are currently in three \u2013 in four countries. In the next 12 months we will be in two more and probably a seventh, if you will, the third of three more will be probably a year and a half, two years out and so that is a business that is more profitable as a percent of sales than the core business and still relatively small. It\u2019s big, it\u2019s $3 billion plus, but I'm happy to say over the last probably 10 or so 2.5, 2.75 years, we\u2019ve seen year-over-year increases right around 20%, 18% to 20%, which is both \u2013 mostly comp, and so that\u2019s been pretty good for us. John Parker : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning, Richard. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You have been putting up such great traffic trends for so long, I think some of it has been due to the improvement in your fresh, rolling out more gas stations. How long can that continue? What is your expectation on the sustainability of the recent traffic performance? Richard Galanti : Well, you know, we cross our fingers and hope it will continue. I mean we are out there every day trying to get new items and new exciting stuff and lower some of our prices. And organics has helped, gas helps. We are still certainly as many new locations that can get gas gets it which is more than the company average and there is still several out there that existing locations that we are fighting hard to get gas stations or buying land next door or appealing the 12th appeal out there ourselves in one city I can think of. But at the end of the day, that is what we do. So fresh \u2013 in my view, fresh foods, gas, executive membership, opening in new geographic markets outside of United States, all those things are net positives. I remember when the economy kind of crashed in late 2008, I remember at the end of calendar 2009 when we had a full year of right around 4% maybe 4.1% or 4.2% frequency increases, I remember warning everybody that if it\u2019s zero in calendar 2010, that\u2019s a 2% compounded, which is better than our historical average so how can we sustain that? We are now six years of a little over 4% compounded. In my view, anything in and around that range we will continue to try to do, but there is no predicting it. Michael Lasser : And you are not \u2013 are you seeing any differences in the month-to-month like more variability\u2026? Richard Galanti : Where the variability has been of late is Easter fell two or three weeks different year-over-year so it is kind of like you need to look at an eight week average, the two-month average or eight- or nine-week average, not just a given week because the numbers are a little screwy trying to compare them when there's things like that. Same thing with Memorial Day, which is I think a week different. Michael Lasser : Okay. And then on the return of cash, you have been stepping up activity [indiscernible] in the market over the last couple of quarters. Should we expect that to continue? It sounds like you also like the special dividend, so how are you going to balance out the activity? Thank you so much. Richard Galanti : Well, I think what we\u2019ve said in the past is, is that, generally speaking, we generate more cash than we spend on ramped up CapEx, although ramped up CapEx will be our first and foremost directive. We do have a little debt to pay down. We are cognizant of the fact that I think as a board to be pro-shareholder and having done now, we have two data points for special dividends, but two points does not a trend make, but it worked pretty well and we will see what the future brings. I think in terms of stock buybacks, I think as I mentioned in the past, we will continue to buy sometimes on a regular basis, sometimes periodically, but we don\u2019t know \u2013 as long as we feel good about the long-term of our company, we don\u2019t know when we are going to be complete right or a little wrong and so if we buy over a longer period of time on a regular basis, we generally like that way to do it. And we certainly picked up in the last couple of quarters and there is no reason to change that. But let\u2019s see what tomorrow brings. Michael Lasser : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot. Good morning to you. First of all, any initial thoughts on the transition process as you move away from AmEx to your new credit card deal whether there is any friction in the process? And when do you think you will get visibility or maybe will get visibility on how the economics impact the offer in your financials? Richard Galanti : Right. Well, there is not a lot we could say at this point. Needless to say we are excited about it. I\u2019m not excited about the transition because there is work to be done, but we are getting through that. And there is really not a lot that we could be able to say about the new program other than needless to say we wouldn\u2019t have done this unless we found it was better for our members. And just like when we price goods, the old adage was for every dollar we save, we give $0.90 to the customer, that\u2019s not a fixed formula needless to say, but we are going to give most of it to the member and it\u2019s a lot and we will let you know next March or April. Matthew Fassler : That\u2019s very helpful. Second question, just thinking about the U.S. comp ex-gas that you reported and trying to square it with the monthly data that comes out, I know that the months don't align with the quarters necessarily. But I think you had two 7s and a 4 and the straight average of that would be around a 6 and you printed a 5. So what would account for the variability in the U.S. comp ex-gas that we saw for the quarter and the months that comprised most of it? Richard Galanti : Well, without even looking at it, it's two things. It\u2019s going to be rounding and it\u2019s going to be the months don\u2019t align with the quarters. Part of February was the end of Q2 and part of it was the beginning of Q3, the same thing with May. The first week of May was part of Q3 and the next three weeks are going to be part of Q4. I did mention earlier in the call because we did see a comment or two, I don\u2019t know if one of those was from you that there was some that suggested perhaps May was getting off to a weak start and that\u2019s not the case. Matthew Fassler : Got it. That is helpful. Finally, Spain, if you just give us some early thoughts on what you are seeing and just kind of lessons learned if you will going forward as you think about Europe more broadly? Richard Galanti : Well, basically as I\u2019ve said, but people have asked sales were a little less than we have planned, but growing nicely and membership sign-ups are just fine, probably a little stronger than our original plan and the renewals so far are good. So, recognizing, our first opening there was where we could open first in terms of timing that\u2019s Seville and we are excited about being there. Our next two openings which would be later this calendar year and early next calendar year will be two units in Madrid, which is a bigger market and so we are \u2013 it is again a little lower sales than originally planned, but membership sign-ups are good and actually a little better than planned, so we will be fine. Matthew Fassler : And cost of doing business and the whole cultural dynamic you are finding is in sync with what you expected? Richard Galanti : Yeah it is as expected. The good news is whatever the labor issues or policies we know that we have got great product and services and the best prices and people seem to like it and as it relates to any restrictions on labor or whatever or closing in some countries, in one country in Asia we have to close two Sundays a month as to other big boxes. So, the good news is it rains on everybody and we think all things being equal we\u2019ve got a good competitive stance. Matthew Fassler : Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, I wanted to follow up on the traffic question a little differently. So if I look at the trend, so last August traffic inflected by about 100 basis points to 150 basis points from the prior rolling average. If I look at the March, April period together, it looks like it decelerated back down to 3.5. So, I guess what do you attribute the acceleration and then recent deceleration to? And does it line up at all with sort of how your gallonage comps changed over that period as you had widened the gap out versus the market bringing price down more slowly? Richard Galanti : Yeah. If I knew the exact answer I would retire and just give that out on a consulting basis. A lot of \u2013 some of it I think has to do with gas when the prices fall dramatically, we get a lot more press, but then I remember when prices were very low we were getting bumps in gallonage like we had never seen before in the low double digits on a gallonage comp basis. So, there is no, nothing is that predictive. I think the last couple of months, I remember several weeks ago we were looking at a several week period and again frequency had come down like you say to the \u2013 from something above a 4 to something below, you know in the mid-to-high 3\u2019s and we say is this the beginning of that then the next week it was back up So, it is really not predictable, if you ask me six years ago and today is 4% sustainable, no, but we are going to keep working at it, one of the things that could help it go in positive directions adding gas stations to existing units not just in the U.S. and Canada, but elsewhere. We have a couple, two or three in Australia, one or two. I think three and a couple more coming. We are going to open about in a couple of other countries. Again it\u2019s a little relative to the whole pie, but its lots of little things, that\u2019s one of them. Fresh foods, I\u2019m convinced there is still going to be a driver going forward. Opening new warehouses and new markets that are much less saturated markets will help that number. So, I think all the executive membership penetration increasing will help that number. What won\u2019t help the number is that there is, you know it is a hard number to sustain and I am pleased to say that for six and a half years we have and we will see what tomorrow brings again and we feel pretty good about what we\u2019re doing and all those things would help. Chris Horvers : Absolutely, and I think we all agree like that 3.5% to 4% is sustainable. Did you see, what were gallonage comps? I think if you look back to past gas price drop, they are running sort of mid-single digits. They had I think revved up to about 15%. Had they come back down to closer to 5% in this most recent quarter? Richard Galanti : I honestly don\u2019t have that in front of me. We generally don\u2019t give that out we probably \u2013 it comes out occasionally when it went above 10, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s above 10, but it\u2019s certainly positive. I just don\u2019t know on the top of my head. Chris Horvers : Understood, understood. And then as you think about lapping the gas margin benefit in the upcoming quarters, I guess you don't guide, but you have a lot of positive things going on underneath in the margin structure, core margins. You are getting better payroll leverage than you had prior. So, I guess what\u2019s the degree of difficulty in terms of actually seeing margin expansion as you lap those, I guess two big quarters where you had 10s of basis points of gas benefit? Richard Galanti : You are talking about operating margins? Chris Horvers : Yes. Richard Galanti : Look we are up against \u2013 Q4 of last year was the first in a while outsized gasoline profitability, should be pretty good this quarter, but I don\u2019t know if we get all the way, I don\u2019t think we get all the way where we were last quarter and then as I mentioned in Q1 and Q2, they were outsized to some extent. Again Q3 it is not even a factor other than the factor is it is virtually nothing versus it was bigger in those three fiscal quarters. So that will be a tougher comparison. Mind you we\u2019ve also got hit by it seems like $0.04, $0.05, $0.06 a quarter on FX. At some point the dollar is going to slow down and shrink and maybe even reverse a little bit, I don\u2019t know when and if and when, maybe it\u2019s another year of FX weakness for us first and but at some point I think that impact will mitigate. So, the good news is that some of these outside gas quarters have been equally hit by outsize FX hits just because of the strong U.S. dollar, maybe there is a couple of quarters in there where you get both hits, but as long as we are \u2013 we are really worried about driving frequency, driving sales, the unit sales as well and having mid strong membership sign-ups in renewal rates and all those things are good. Again, we recognize that looking at some metrics there maybe a couple of tough comparisons in the next several quarters, but that\u2019s what we do. Chris Horvers : And then just one last follow-up. You have had 10 basis points to 20 basis points of payroll leverage these past couple of quarters despite a total reported comp that was hit 600 basis points, 700 basis points by FX and gas., so your leverage point seems a lot lower now, so should we expect that to continue as you go against the tougher gas margin comparisons? Thanks. Richard Galanti : By the way that 10 plus basis point has payroll end benefits and chunk of it has also been healthcare not this quarter, but in couple of recent quarters before this quarter with a little bit of workers comp benefit too. By the way what helps those numbers also has increased foreign expansion. There is a \u2013 just on benefits, which is primarily healthcare medical, dental, and vision in a large extent. They are U.S. versus other countries. In some countries there is 40 basis points to 60 basis points of delta just on that SG&A item because healthcare cost in the U.S. are so much higher than everywhere else. And then payroll, our 22 or just under 22 on an hour average in the U.S. we have comparable premiums above other retail in each country, but in some countries that comparable is $11 or $12 not $22. So, increasing penetrations of some of those countries help. So, we\u2019ve got some of those things helping us irrespective of everything else. I think, we focus on payroll and benefits, which is whatever 70% of SG&A, 60% plus of SG&A more than anything and if we can drive sales that helps a lot. And what also helps those numbers fortunately is increased penetration outside the United States. But in the last couple of quarters, we also benefited on healthcare in the United States as we started to see a few things we've changed like preferred provider networks, but still giving great coverage to our members \u2013 to our employees. Chris Horvers : Very helpful, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Good morning and thank you for, first of all, taking all those questions. I want to just follow up on comments you are making around international margin. We will find out more details in the 10-Q around the specific performance of Canada and international margins in this period versus the U.S. But just speaking broadly and historically, you\u2019ve had 150-basis point to 200-basis point favorable gap in your international markets versus the U.S. As we think about your continued expansion where there may be some impact with cannibalization as we think about your move into Europe, the relationship that you have with Alibaba, with Tmall or any other external factors regarding competitive changes or labor costs in some of these markets outside the U.S., how do you feel about the sustainability of these high 3% to 4.5% margins in those markets? Is that sustainable or do you think that will over time contract closer to the U.S.? Richard Galanti : You know, if I were a betting person, it's going to be higher than the U.S. I think what I have said in the past is, is that ultimately some of the highest profitable countries will come down a little, but still going to be higher than the U.S. There is just so many moving parts to that question in terms of what. I think when we go into a new country by definition we lose money for the first few years as we did in Japan many years ago. And then when we went from nine to 20 units in about a two-year period in Japan, we cannibalized the hell out of the existing units. We have now started to see that improve and we are going \u2013 the rest of this calendar year we will open four more in Japan and several more in the future. So I think that at least for the foreseeable future, we will see stronger profitability percentages outside of the U.S., but hopefully we can see the U.S. number improve a little too. But having an increased sales penetration outside the U.S., which has a higher than U.S. profitability should help a little. And again, that is why we say that statement at the beginning of this thing, whatever we say today we don't have to update tomorrow until we talk to you again in a quarter. But overall I think that those trends will continue but when we open a new country by definition, we get hit a little bit but it is a little bit on a much bigger company today too. Paul Trussell : Understood. And just regarding the store count and growth, I missed some of your comments and I apologize, but I know that \u2013 I think the new forecast for 24 \u2013 is for 24 store openings this year with some slipping into the first quarter. What was that \u2013 at this point in time, what would your crystal ball say around fiscal 2016 openings given this slippage? Would it still be around 30 store openings as you think about next year? Richard Galanti : I would say 30 or low 30s. What\u2019s going to happen just like this year, I think if I go back to the beginning of time, we are going to be in the 30 or the low 30s, inevitably 10 or 12 of those are in the last six weeks of the fiscal year. We are pushing for it, we are trying. Inevitably things happen whether it\u2019s cold weather or you have to wait for the ground to thaw out or some other roadblock with one of the permits to get open. And so there are lots of different reasons. But when we started, this was kind of our best guess stretch effort and inevitably a few fall out. I think a few more than we had planned fell out into next quarter, but it is a matter of months, it is not a matter of reducing something that fell out of bed completely. That happens less frequently. So I think the 30+ number this year came down to an actual 24 gives me a lot more confidence next year's 30, low 30 number is much more achievable. But if we do 15 to 18, if we only do 15 in the first four months that gives me pretty good confidence we can get to 30 for sure. But for sure is a guess until we get there next year. Paul Trussell : Understood. Thank you. Good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird. Peter Benedict : Hey, Richard, a couple of things. Just back to the sales to make sure I'm thinking about this correctly, your April sales release allows you to kind of calculate the 11 week sales growth number for the quarter was like up 0.8% and then the quarter full 12 weeks was up 1.1% so it seems pretty clear that that May started off at least on a pretty healthy note relative to how trends had been for the rest of the quarter. Is that the right way to look at it? Richard Galanti : Well, it\u2019s consistent with what I said at the beginning of the call about the first couple of weeks of May are just fine. Peter Benedict : Okay, good. The other \u2013 executive membership rollout, you are currently I think in four countries. Can you remind us how you are thinking about that, what would it take for you to kind of start introducing that into some other countries? Richard Galanti : We like the executive membership program. In our view, we need at least a core base of units to do it because you want to go out there and not \u2013 and while the 2% reward is certainly an important part of the executive membership program, so are many of the executive member services and other benefits. And we need more than a few units to do that. But we like it and if we could have it everywhere, one day we will. We want to be able a bit more true with more locations in a market. Certainly in the UK with something in the mid-20s and Mexico in the low to mid-30s number of units and certainly Canada and the U.S. With Japan, 20 going to 24, that \u2013 just looked at how many units we have and I'm not suggesting \u2013 I don't know if we have any plans currently to do it. Right now our plans are to get a bunch more openings in these countries and the country past those four with the most units right now is Japan and that trend will continue. So we will see. Peter Benedict : Okay. And then lastly, just the gas mix in the third quarter, what was it as a percentage of sales and what was it a year ago? Thank you. Richard Galanti : I believe it was about somewhere between 9and 10 for this quarter and I am guessing we are looking it up as we speak, but I'm guessing it\u2019s somewhere in the 11 range, maybe 12. 9 this year, 11 last year rounding. Peter Benedict : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Kelly Bania : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First just housekeeping, I don't know if I missed this, but can you talk about your membership fee income growth excluding the impact from FX? Richard Galanti : Sure. I think, again, dollars assuming flat FX was up 7% for the quarter, which is I think ends up 7 basis points, so overall a good number. I think again that\u2019s partly the fact that sign-ups are doing pretty good and partly rental rates continue to be good and partly conversions to executive member. When I look at all of those components, the one thing that continues to surprise me from a number of years ago, the number of new executive members, which is a combination of sign-ups and higher percentage of new sign-ups being to the executive member in those countries than it had been historically and conversions. So that\u2019s continuing to be probably a little bit number than I would have guessed. Anybody who has wanted it, already has it, but I think we are doing a better job of communicating to the member why it is a good deal. Kelly Bania : Got it. That is helpful. And then Richard, you mentioned organics a couple of times already. Just curious if you could talk about what the run rate is for that business at this point in terms of dollars that you are doing in organic foods and what the opportunity is? Really you mentioned supply maybe a little bit challenging, what are you doing to work around that? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, I think it was about six or nine months ago I had mentioned that, it was about $3 billion, up kind of a double in the past two years. I guess that at least it has a 4 in front of it now given just extrapolating that and probably the challenges are still out there although they are becoming less formidable because we like everybody else \u2013 there is more organic supply and producers doing it. And we are pretty good at getting out there and working with suppliers, both here and around the world to commit more to it, whether it\u2019s raising eggs or ground beef processing or produce, and so it is going to still \u2013 it should still drive sales and drive incremental sales. I have given a couple of anecdotal examples over the last couple of years, one of that was when we introduced organic fresh ground beef 80% of it was to existing members that like us, but never bought ground beef from us because they are organic ground beef buyers and so it had the benefit of incremental, mostly incremental business to us at a little better margin at a greater savings versus our competitors because it is organic. And so that will continue to be nice, but it is, I put it under that category of \u2013 the good news is it is a lot of different things and certainly that\u2019s one of them. Kelly Bania : Great, that is helpful. If I could just also ask about produce supply in the quarter. Some complaining about a tough growing season, maybe a little bit of impact from the ports, did you see any impact from that and if so, is it getting better now or just any color there? Richard Galanti : The remarks I always get from our fresh foods buyers are as soon as something good happens and something doesn\u2019t \u2013 something bad happens. The only impact in terms of sales from the port issue was exporting. We do a great business and Asia is an example and Australia, and while a lot of that fresh stuff is sent on \u2013 is air freighted anyway, whatever incremental was required was air freighted as well, so probably impacted margin a little bit to the negative and supply a little bit to the negative overseas. Other than that I know berries which is a big business for us, is very depended on what\u2019s going on with weather and crop and that was hit a little bit in the last couple of months, but notwithstanding that, our fresh margins were actually quite good in the last month or two. Kelly Bania : Okay, thanks. That is helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair. Mark Miller : Hi, Richard. I know the new member sign-ups were impacted by the club openings in Asia last year, but I guess a little bit bigger question, a bigger picture question, could you give us some insight into the portion of new member sign-ups that are coming from the younger demographic versus the long-term historical mix at Costco? Richard Galanti : I know it is more, I don\u2019t have the numbers completely in front of me and in our view it\u2019s two reasons it\u2019s organic and it\u2019s a couple of the things we did like living social, which was a lot more than that, but actually the gap between our average age members and the U.S. average age has actually been reduced a little bit. I think we\u2019ve historically been a couple of years older than the average U.S. and now it\u2019s a little bit less than that. So, all I can tell you is it\u2019s trending in the right direction. We are not terribly concerned about at this point, we are seeing younger people join us and certainly we know that some of the things that we are not doing like organic is a part of that. Mark Miller : Oh that\u2019s great because clearly Costco is getting business from other retailers that are hurt by e-commerce, but you would think that younger demographic, the millennial might be converting to e-commerce at a faster rate \u2013 so\u2026 Richard Galanti : They maybe, but not everybody is going to sit at home and do everything. I maybe in a small group here, but I actually enjoy going to Costco and I know a lot of people too. And it\u2019s kind of hard to get gas delivered to you. And if we can get you in the parking lot that helps. So, ultimately it\u2019s value. We recognize that convenience is value and we are not the best at some convenient side, so we\u2019re not going to the be company that delivers two different cereals to your doorstep at 7 AM, as long as you order by 10 PM the night before, soon by 3 AM in the morning probably. But we will sell to some of those people and more importantly there is a lot of reasons to come into Costco. So, we have a unique value proposition. I think we benefit while all \u2013 first of all we will get some of the e-commerce business in addition to the extent that all of us, every brick and mortar loses something to e-commerce incrementally, we probably will lose at least so far a little less incrementally, but we are also gaining incrementally on market share of other things. So, all those things help us, but I can tell you, we don\u2019t have our head in the sand, but we\u2019re not going to \u2013 we know there is certain things we can\u2019t do as well. But what we can do really well is value in terms of quality and the things that we saw and we will keep doing that. Mark Miller : Yeah, it\u2019s clearly working. Other question is the 2% reward impact in the fiscal third quarter, minus 3 basis points versus minus 1 basis point in the first half all ex-gas, I\u2019m assuming that FX may be partly contributing to that because of smaller penetration outside the US. But is there anything else that is causing that? Richard Galanti : That\u2019s it. No, mind you any basis point or two hit to that number means an increasing penetration to that group. Not only new executive members, but executive members shot more frequently and buy more. Mark Miller : Exactly. All right, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Nomura. Bob Drbul : Hi Richard, I just have one question. I think you said you are launching two new e-commerce sites in new countries in the next 12 months and one more the year after. Can you tell us what those countries are? Richard Galanti : I think they are two of the three Asia countries and \u2013 Korea and Taiwan I believe. Bob Drbul : And so where does that put you overall in terms of the total number of countries that you will be operating in on e-commerce? Richard Galanti : We are in nine countries, mind you one location in Spain and seven in Australia. So, we are nine countries, we currently are in four, so put us at six of nine, but a higher percentage that\u2019s six ninths of number of warehouses needless to say. Bob Drbul : Great. Thank you, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : Hey guys good morning. I wanted to ask about IT modernization. You obviously mentioned some of the costs that are involved. Can you just update us on the benefits that you are seeing now and where we are at in the process and timeline of the rollout? Richard Galanti : A little tongue in cheek, the biggest benefit is, is we haven\u2019t screwed it up. We probably felt that we should have been modernizing for a number of years. We were really good at keeping stuff cheap and band-aided and we also recognized that if we are going to trying to try to double our business in the next ten years and that\u2019s around, it is not a plan, it\u2019s just 7% compounded for 10 years is a double. But going into more countries and doing more things than we need better systems and because first of all we are going to outgrow, we were starting to see the seams of some of the existing systems. So, first and foremost it was a necessity. Secondly, as a very simple example, our membership system. There is two ways you can change your mailing address or your phone number or anything else or add-on or take of a business add-on member. You call it 800 number or you come into the membership desk. Soon you will be able to do that online, but I recognize we\u2019re not the first to do that, but there is still lot of things like that. We think that there is big savings in transportation management and a lot of little things like that membership thing, if you think about, if we\u2019ve got 40 plus million member households only a small percentage of us have to want to change their address or move or change of members on it or change of phone number and you can think about how many millions fewer of these can be done online instead of talking to somebody at Costco. We are seeing some benefits in the membership desk, but we are just rolling it out. So, I\u2019d say there is still more cost to benefit. The big benefits are to come when we get like the depot and transportation management systems, when we get the buyers on the new system, after I\u2019m sure a little bit of indigestion that\u2019s still a year and a half out that\u2019s kind of the culmination of other modules that are going into place soon. Let me just look here one other thing. You know in service so far, a new payroll system, which is not a big benefit, but it was a big necessity. The members in point of sales systems are new and there is some efficiencies in the point of sale. Both inefficiencies and enhancements to be able to do all the things we are doing with \u2013 we and other retailers are doing with security and things like that, data security. Pending again the big ones, the main accounting system will go in next, merchandising will shortly follow, and again the depot management system will be a little earlier than that I believe. But any big benefits from it will be at least a year out, maybe more. We are starting to see some little benefits from some of the things that we have done, but the big news is that it is working so far, costing more than we expected, taking a little longer than we expected, but it\u2019s working. Michael Montani : Great, thanks. And then to follow up on categories just for a minute in consumer electronics, you guys I think were up a little bit there, which is impressive given the West Coast port. So can you just give us some color on kind of TV units and ASP and just what is driving the strength? Richard Galanti : I don't have that in front of me. I think for the last few months, I mean TV sales have been up slightly on average in terms of dollars. My guess is \u2013 again, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but ASPs have probably come down a few percentage points. We tend to sell bigger ticket TVs and the newer ones, the bigger screens as an example. But if anything I\u2019d guess that the dollar number is in the low single digits, low to mid single digits and the ASP represents a low single to maybe upper middle-digit number and it fluctuates a little every month. I'm sorry, that\u2019s what I can recall. Michael Montani : Got it. Thanks. And the last question I had was just more conceptual, which is if you think about some of the competitive set and what they have been doing, one change that a competitor has done recently is rolling out by online, pickup in club and it seems to have made a material impact on their business. Can you just talk a little bit about the puts and takes that you guys would have from a labor model standpoint as well as cross-shop treasure hunt standpoint of potentially doing something like that? And the follow-up to that is another competitor has got a beta test this summer with $50 shipping. I understand there is Google Express and so forth, but should we expect any direct response to that or is it kind of wait and see and how you think through those two things? Richard Galanti : There is no current plan for any direct response to it. We do at our business centers deliver to businesses, not to homes. But again, what we are doing so far is working pretty well for us. Your one comment or suggestion about that the incremental buying when somebody is actually in-store, it is huge. We want them in store and when you order online, there is a cost and a convenience in terms of just ordering and picking up. We would like not to have to do that and so there are no plans right now given how we are performing. We always monitor what others are doing. There is a lot of things that others do from giving away memberships more freely or more discounted to advertising in newspapers. I am sure they work, but it is nothing that we want to do at this point. Michael Montani : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : Hi, guys. Thanks and thanks for letting it go so long. I will be quick. I just wanted a housekeeping item. I know you said the renewal rate was 91% in the U.S., Richard. Do you actually have the exact number? Do you know the exact number? I know, I think, it was like 90.7% last time; I was just trying to understand what the exact number is. Richard Galanti : It still rounds up to 91%. We try to just keep \u2013 it is about the same, maybe [indiscernible] \u2013 it is about the same. Scott Mushkin : Okay. Second question, when you do the tech and some of the updates, I know you said the membership desk and whatnot and obviously the ancillary businesses are going well, but the constant feedback we get from people, members, is, gosh, I didn't really realize Costco did travel or car buying programs or garage doors or some of the other stuff you guys do. I mean, is there \u2013 how do you envision maybe getting the word out better to the membership base over time? And then \u2013 that is my last question. Richard Galanti : I think that\u2019s a good point. Word of mouth is certainly something that we rely on a lot. I think we do a better job today even in the Costco Connection and again, our membership marketing department is starting to test a few things whether it\u2019s on different internet sites and what have you. But don't expect us to be paying to go advertise or market it anywhere. It\u2019s working fine for us. Clearly travel is one of the best-kept secrets out there. It is huge savings, incredible positive feedback from our members and I personally hear both from people like yourselves to friends where they say they had no idea and they couldn't believe how much they saved. So we are getting better at letting people know about that stuff, but we are not going to go crazy. It works for us the way we do it and the goal is to try to keep getting you in the door because when you are in the door you are going to buy a bunch of stuff and see those garage doors and air-conditioning units as well. Scott Mushkin : All right, perfect. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Cristina Fernandez with Telsey Advisory. Joe Feldman : Hey, guys, it\u2019s Joe Feldman on. Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to follow up again on the inventory. I know you commented that you did the physical inventory and everything was pretty clean. But again, this was the first quarter in like the past three or four where inventory growth did outpace sales growth and presumably some of that is the FX. But I guess I was wondering if you could talk about that a little bit, if there is any driver there, if there is any one area of the inventory that may be a little heavy? Richard Galanti : It really is across categories, maybe a little higher in some of those categories that come by boat, shipped from Asia. By the way when the slowdown was solved, that was just the beginning of a two or three month period of catching up backlog and so bringing in some seasonal items, not having some patio furniture as an example right after \u2013 we were fine through Christmas because we like other retailers were able to get some of that stuff in a little earlier than planned. So the good news is I think because we are in seasons early and out seasons early, we were all a little later, but we were just fine. I think \u2013 I am guessing again \u2013 we will wait and see until the fourth quarter end, but I am guessing you will see that trend reverse a little given ex-FX given that some of it had to do with that. We haven't seen any change in markdowns at all related to having a little extra inventory as these containers were catching up. Joe Feldman : Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys, and good luck with this quarter. Richard Galanti : Thanks, everyone, and have a good morning or afternoon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand today\u2019s call over to Richard Galanti. Please go ahead, sir. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Kayla. Good morning to everyone. Last night we reported operating results for the 16-week fourth quarter and 52-week fiscal year that ended August 30. These results are compared to the similar 16 and 52-week periods of fiscal 2014, which ended last year on August 31. Please note that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. To begin with our fourth quarter fiscal 2015 operating results, net sales for the fourth quarter came in at $35 billion, up 1% overall a year ago. Comp sales were down 1% on a reported basis, but were up 6% including the negative gas and FX impacts. Gas prices for the quarter were down 21% year-over-year, negatively impacting U.S. comp figures by little more than 3 percentage points, so a plus 6 U.S. comp, excluding gas price deflation. Foreign currencies overall were weaker relative to the dollar year-over-year in the fourth quarter, such that our reported international comps on a reported basis of minus 10% in Canada and a minus 7% international \u2013 in other international. Assuming flat year-over-year FX rates and excluding gas price deflation would have been plus 7% in Canada and plus 6% elsewhere internationally. For the quarter, earnings per share came in at $1.73, up $0.15, or 10% from last year\u2019s $1.58 figure. In terms of a year-over-year comparison \u2013 the EPS comparison, a few items of note, and the biggest item of note, FX. In Q4 year-over-year, the foreign currencies where we operate were weaker versus the U.S. dollar, resulting in our reported foreign earnings this year in Q4, being lower by about $53 million after-tax, or $0.12 a share than these earnings would have been had FX exchange rates have been flat year-over-year. Number two, income taxes. Our income taxes this year in Q4 included several discrete items that, in the aggregate, decreased our income tax line by $23 million, or about $0.05 a share. The largest component of the $23 million figure was a $17 million, or almost $0.04 a share income tax benefit that resulted from our decision to repatriate in the near future from Canada back to the U.S. $750 million Canadian, or about $560 million U.S. of cash balances. Third item of note, IT monetization. As discussed in the past several quarters, our major IT monetization efforts are ongoing and will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expense percentages through the next fiscal year and possibly beyond, especially as new major systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In the fourth quarter on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs have impacted SG&A by an estimated $22 million, or 6 basis points \u2013 4 basis points without deflation in FX or about $0.03 a share. And lastly, LIFO. Last year in the fourth quarter we recorded a pre-tax LIFO charge of $11 million pre-tax, or $0.02 a share. This year, we actually had a LIFO credit or a bring back of $14 million pre-tax, or $0.02 a share, lot of that had to do with gas deflation. In terms of new openings, for all of fiscal 2015, we opened 25 new locations, which included two relos, so a net of 23. 12 new in the U.S., three each in Mexico and Japan, and one each in Canada, UK, Taiwan, Korea, and Australia, which therefore ended fiscal 2015 a few weeks back with 23 net new warehouses and a total of 686 locations operating worldwide. For the current fiscal year 2016, our plans are to add up to 32 net new warehouses, including a few business centers in the U.S. 18 to 20 of the planned new locations will be in the United States with the remaining in international markets, including our second opening in Spain and our first opening planned for France. During the first fourth months of 2016 through calendar year end, we plan to open 13 of those up to 32 warehouses, including two relos of net of 11 and nine in the U.S., one each in Canada, Australia, Japan, and Spain, and then the two U.S. relos are in that 11 figure \u2013 in the 9 figure, sorry. Also, this morning I\u2019ll review with you our membership trends and related activities, our e-commerce activities, plenty of discussion on margins and SG&A and recent stock repurchase activities. Okay. So for first \u2013 fourth quarter results, sales, again, for the fourth quarter and the 16 weeks ended August 30, were $35 billion, up 1% from last year\u2019s $34.8 billion. On a reported basis, again, comps were down minus 1%. For the quarter just minus 1% reported comp figure was a combination of an average transaction decrease of about 4.5% for the quarter. And again, this included the detriment from FX of a little over 4%, and gasoline price deflation of a little over 2.5% impact. So as you can see, excluding the \u2013 these negative factors, comps overall were up 6%, and the transaction actually on an ex-gas and FX would have been slightly positive. And an average frequency increase of just under 4%, at about 3 and 3.25%. In terms of sales by geographic region, most U.S. regions registered low single-digit comp increases, again, that \u2013 these numbers include the impact of gas deflation of little over 3% in the U.S. with the Midwest, Texas, and California being the strongest. Internationally in local currencies, the strongest results in Australia, Mexico, Taiwan, and Spain, recognizing Spain only has one new unit \u2013 one unit. In terms of comp sales by merchandise categories for the quarter, for food and sundries, comps were mostly flat for the quarter, again, all these items \u2013 all these figures include about a 4% detriment from FX. The better-performing departments were deli, sundries and candy. Within Hardlines in the low single-digit range, better-performing departments were sporting goods, hardware, and automotive. Our consumer electronics were negative low single-digit year-over-year positive low single-digit ex-FX. For Softlines, comps were in the low single-digit range, better-performing departments included home furnishings and domestics. And within Fresh Foods, comps were in the low single-digit range as well with best results in deli, produce and meat. Moving on down the income statement to membership fees, on a reported basis, membership fees came in at $785 million, or 2.24% of sales, that\u2019s up $17 million, or 2% in dollar and up 3 basis points. Again, FX have big impact on these dollar figures on a \u2013 assuming flat year-over-year FX, the 2% dollar increase would have been up 6%. In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide. And strong \u2013 also, we\u2019re enjoying strong sign-ups both new and existing warehouses and continued strength in our executive member program. In terms of members at fiscal year end, we had $34.0 million gold star members, up from the most recent quarter of $33.2 million, primary business $7.1 million, up from $7.0 million. We continue to have business add-on members of $3.5 million, so all told member households, 44.6 million at fiscal year end, which is up from 43.7 million 16 weeks earlier. Including additional cards, total cardholders out there stood at 81.3 million in fiscal year end, up from 79.6 million in fiscal quarter ago. At fiscal year end, executive memberships were 16.1 million, which is an increase of about 400,000 members since Q3 end, so about 25,000 a week increase in the quarter. In terms of membership renewal rates, as I mentioned, they continue strong. Total came in at \u2013 rounds up to a 91, and for U.S. and Canada and total worldwide rounds up to an 88. Getting back to the income statement, our gross margin in the fourth quarter on a reported basis was higher year-over-year by 44 basis points coming in at 11.14% this year versus the year ago fourth quarter at 10.70%. Without the impact of gas price deflation, that increase would be up 15 basis points.  Now I ask you to jot down just two columns of numbers looking just at the fourth quarter here, both, the column one would be reported basis and column two would be without gas deflation. First line item would be core merchandise. On a reported basis, year-over-year up 17 basis points, ex-gas deflation down 8 basis points. Ancillary businesses reported plus 25 without gas plus 18, the 2% reward increasing sales penetration related to executive member sales and the 2% reward minus 5 reported and minus 2 ex-gas. LIFO, plus 7 and plus 7 and total the reported basis as I mentioned plus 44 basis points in ex-gas plus 15. Now reviewing these figures again the core merchandise component was up 17, but minus 8 without gas primarily a function of improved year-over-year gross margins within our gasoline and several other ancillary and warehouse businesses. The core merchandize gross margin, which I define as the main four departments, merchandise departments, food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods as a percentage of their own sales were actually up 13 basis points year-over-year; food and sundries, hardlines, softlines were up year-over-year and, while fresh foods was a little lower. Ancillary and other business gross margins were up as I mentioned in a chart there up 25 basis points plus 80 without gas. We enjoyed broad based strength across most of our ancillary businesses with year-over-year gross margin improvements in gas optical hearing aids as well as operating results and ecommerce business centers, travel and executive member services. And LIFO in the fourth quarter as I mentioned it year-over-year was a 4 basis point benefit or $40 million, compared to a 3 basis point detriment a year ago of $11 million. Our year-end inventory shrink results were in line with our all time best results and our inventory positions were at great shape. All in all gross margin of inventory is in good shape. Moving onto the SG&A. Our SG&A percentages year-over-year in the fourth quarter were higher or worse by 27 basis points coming in at right at 10.00% of sales this year, compared to 9.73% last year. Again taking out gas deflation essentially flat year-over-year higher or worse by 1 basis point. Again I\u2019ll ask you to jot down the two columns Q4 reported and Q4 ex-gas deflation in terms of operations reported minus 15 or higher by 15 basis points, without gas deflation plus 8 basis points or lower or better by 8. Central the minus 7 and minus 5, stock compensation at minus 5 and a minus 4. All told we came in on a reported basis higher by 27 basis points in SG&A and again ex-gas deflation minus 1 basis point. And looking at these figures of the operations component of the SG&A was higher again or worse by 15 and again excluding gas lower or better by 8, within operations ex-gas deflation core warehouse payroll and other operating expenses were better by 10 basis points and half of which was improvement in payroll percent. Central expense was higher or worse by 7 basis points year-over-year, 5 without gas with nearly all of that variance could be from an IT monetization efforts 6 and 5 basis points respectively without gas deflation. Lastly stock compensation expense represented again a minus 5 and minus 4 without gas, just we have over 4,000 people on our plan and that\u2019s done well as a compensation tool. Next on the income statement is pre-opening higher by $12 million coming in at $27 million this year versus $15 million a year ago. Last year in fourth quarter we had 10 openings, this year we had 13. Of the $12 million year-over-year incremental expense, which is about $0.02 a share little under half of it is due to incremental units 13 versus 10, the rest about $7 million of variance is simply increasing pre-opening expense associated with upcoming openings in the first several months of our new fiscal year versus the similar period of a year earlier. All told reported operating income in the quarter increased $65 million or 6% year-over-year to $1.156 billion this year. Below the operating income line reported interest expense was higher year-over-year coming in at $40 million this year from third - up from $35 million a year ago. This is mostly due to the interest expense on the billion dollar debt offering that was completed earlier this calendar year to fund a portion of the special dividend. Interest income and other was higher or better year-over-year by $10 million coming in at $40 million this year the fourth quarter versus $30 a year ago. Actual interest income for the quarter came in at $12 million, compared to $17 million a year ago so actually lower by 5. The other component of interest income and other was higher or better by $15 million primarily related to various FX related items [indiscernible] with the foreign countries when they\u2019re locking in some of their FX needs. Overall pretax income was up 6%, or $70 million this year versus last year. In terms of our tax rate, our company tax rate for the quarter came in lower than last year 32.7% this year versus 35.1% last year in the quarter. Again, we benefited from several discrete items in Q4 as I explained \u2013 discussed earlier in the call. Such that, overall net income was up 10%, or $70 million, coming in at $767 million this year in the fourth quarter versus last year fourth quarter net earnings of $697 million. For a quick rundown of other items, while the balance sheet is included in this morning\u2019s press release, a couple of quick balance sheet info items. Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter came in at $351 million and for the year $1.127 billion. Our accounts payable as a percent of inventories on a reported basis was essentially a 100%, 101% both last year and in this year fiscal year end. Ex non-merchandise payables mostly construction related would be that, both the last year in fourth quarter and in this year fourth quarter came in at 89%. In terms of inventory for warehouse, average inventory for warehouse was up 200,000, or 2% to $13 million in Q4 in this year, up from $12.8 million. That\u2019s \u2013 the actual number, again, excluding, assuming FX was flat year-over-year would have been 535,000, or up about 4.2%. The increase pretty much spread across many departments, and no real surprises there. Overall, our inventory is in good shape as I mentioned earlier. In terms of CapEx, in the fourth quarter, we spent $805 million and for all of 2015, the capital expenditures totaled $2.4 billion. Our estimate for fiscal 2016, CapEx is an increase from that $2.4 billion level somewhere in the high 2s, somewhere between $2.8 billion, $3 billion. This year-over-year increase in CapEx represents our plans for more openings this year versus last year. The increase spending for remodeling, expanding ancillary business operations, planned expansion of our cross-dock and distribution operations, and expenditures related to our ongoing IT spending for monetization efforts. In terms of Costco online, we\u2019re still operating Costco online in four countries; U.S., Canada, UK and Mexico. For the fiscal year, total e-commerce sales came in just under $3.5 billion, up a little over 20% for the year. Comp sales in e-commerce, again, were also up 20% for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. In terms of expansion, I talked earlier about up to 32 units, net of relos, we would expect 11 in Q1, three in Q2, seven in Q3, and 11 in Q4, Q4 being a little longer fiscal period 16 weeks versus 12 weeks than the others. In fiscal 2015, I mentioned on a net basis, we had 23 units on a base of 653, so about 3.5% square footage growth. This year assuming the 32 units on a base of 686, that would be just under 5% square footage growth. In terms of new locations by country, assuming that 30, 32 figure, about 18 in the U.S., Canada up three, two each in Japan and Australia, and one each in UK, Taiwan, Korea, Mexico, Spain and France. As of fourth quarter end, total square footage stood at 98.7 million square feet. In terms of common stock repurchases buybacks, for the fourth quarter, we spent $260 million on 1.836 million shares, at an average price of just under $142. On an annualized basis, that would be about $850 million, as an annualized run rate during the quarter. For the year, we spent $484 million at an average price of $142.87. In terms of dividends, our third quarterly dividend stands at $0.40 a share, or $1.60 a share annualized, that was up 12.5% from the prior quarterly rate that paid in the first two quarters of fiscal 2015. This year is $1.60 per share dividend, represents an annual cost to the company of about $700 million. And as you know, back in February, we did a special dividend of $5 per share, which was a total of $2.2 million special dividend paid out to shareholders. Lastly, before I turn it over to Kayla for Q&A, our fiscal 2016 first quarter schedule earnings release date for the 12-week first quarter ending on November 22, would be after market close on Tuesday December 8, with the earnings call the following morning on the 9th of December. With that, I\u2019ll open it up for questions and turn it back to Kayla. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Charles Grom from Sterne, Agee Credit. Charles Grom : Hey, good morning, Richard. Richard Galanti : Hi. Charles Grom : Just on the core margin performance in the quarter, I think you said, it was up 13 basis points. Could you delve into the performance by the four sub-categories? I know you said that food, hardlines and softlines were all up. Just curious, the \u2013 why the pressure on the fresh food side? Richard Galanti : Well I think the pressure on the fresh food side is us. We \u2013 when you\u2019ve got some inflation on some of the commodity items like eggs, you\u2019ve got a \u2013 we\u2019re not changing the price of a 16 pack of muffins or a slice of pizza or hotdog. So it has more to do with that and nothing really surprising there. If you look at each of those four categories, again overall, the gross margin as a percent of sale \u2013 their own sales year-over-year in the quarter was up 13. I think the range was in the low 20s on the high side and the mid-teens on that negative downside. So not \u2013 pretty much similar slightly above last year, no real big changes there. Charles Grom : Okay. Good. And then when you look to next year, just kind of switching gears a little bit when you switched to Visa from AmEx, can you shape out for us how the switch is going to work and be handled, and what you\u2019re planning to do with the interchange savings that you\u2019re going to generate? And also just looking back, how you handled it in Canada and any surprises on that front? Richard Galanti : No. I mean, things in Canada first of all went \u2013 have gone fine; a little different in Canada, because of certain Canadian issues. The portfolio was not purchased by the new issuer, so we had essentially you have people apply for it. That being said, they shop at Costco, they want that co-branded card, and it\u2019s just fine. You see a little bit of change in renewal rate when that happens, because of auto renewals. You\u2019ve got to re-sign people up and everything. But from an improvement in terms of additional moneys be it for us in terms of lower merchant fees, or our members in terms of a better rewards on the co-brand that\u2019s all that is planned. In the U.S., we\u2019re working through everything right now. The plan is for, again, the current contract ends on March \u2013 at the end of March next year, that could be in and around the month or two from there. The two parties AmEx and Citi continue to work towards that end. And we will expect to tell you more when we can. In terms of how it\u2019s going to be split between merchant fees and rewards, I think our \u2013 I think I have stated in the past, our philosophy is to, when we save money on product purchases, we want to give most of it back to the consumer to the customer. And we\u2019re looking at all kinds of opportunities to do that, so stay tuned. Charles Grom : Okay, fair enough. And just last question, August comps were obviously pretty good. Just wondering, with September almost closed here, any surprises on September sales for you guys? Richard Galanti : If I could tell you, I would. We\u2019ll wait until next week. Charles Grom : All right. Fair enough. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. Good morning, Richard. Quick question, I think you telegraphed this on the sales side, Labor Day, realizing it was in September both years. But this year, the quarter may not have caught the \u2013 I guess, the lead-up to it. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a big deal from a sales or earnings perspective, just quickly on that. Richard Galanti : More of just a sales perspective, given you\u2019re talking mid single, low single-digit numbers reported normalized and reported. We basically, in August, it was a \u2013 we feel a negative impact of about 1 percentage point. And there will be a corresponding improvement in September reported for the same reason, because of the \u2013 but four weeks versus five, so it\u2019s a little less of a positive, maybe 0.7% or 0.8% if our crystal ball is correct. So yes, the August numbers were impacted negatively a little and the September number will show little positive that we\u2019ll point that out in the release. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then the second question, on membership fees and potential increases. Just a question on the thought process, and I think in the past largely you\u2019ve done them to cover inflation. I\u2019m sure there has been inflation over the past five years in many areas. So can you talk about considerations and how you think about it? Are you surveying? Are you probing customers ahead of time to understand what\u2019s tolerable? And then taking into account that the landscape is evolving a little, you have some nontraditional online model, membership model. So how do you think about the right range to raise that? Richard Galanti : Well, I think we\u2019ve done $6, $5 increases over roughly 30 years, generally about every five or so years. We don\u2019t do a lot of polling. We look at it internally \u2013 have we improved the value of that membership to our member. In terms of the tolerability of it to the member, I know, our historical five in the case of the executive member last time five years ago $10 increase is a heck of a lot less than we see in other types of fees out there, be it fees for television, or your phones, or other services out there. So I firstly don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to ever be an issue. When is \u2013 we really haven\u2019t talked about it a lot, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll probably do at some point, but stay tuned. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Good morning, Richard. Wanted to just discuss assortment and fulfillment online, certainly across the industry, there has been a lot of competition and investments being made in fulfillment whether is Amazon or Jet.com, or some of the newer initiatives from Sam\u2019s Club. Could you just discuss some of your recent online sales trends and any updates that you could provide for us on upcoming enhancements around assortment or fulfillment online? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t think there\u2019s, I mean, in terms of \u2013 there are a few things I mentioned over the last few quarters on a topical basis, we certainly expanded to some extent the SKU selection and added what I would call more frequent \u2013 frequently purchased items, be it food and sundries or a few office needs everything from, again, sundry items to health and beauty aids, K-cups, few apparel items. And so we\u2019ve expanded that. We took certain key departments and brought them in line. So we are not competing with each other and providing, I think, little more excitement to that. We ship out of more than one depot. When we first started this for the first several years in the U.S., everything was shipped out of one depot in Southern California, which meant that, it might take a little longer to get to you and it cost us a little more in terms of delivery or the member. And as we have expanded, we\u2019ve improved that quite a bit as well, quite a bit for us. And we\u2019re pleased with the fact that sales for the last, gosh, the last two, three years, at least, have been on a year-over-year comp basis around 20%. So, we\u2019re doing it methodically. We\u2019re not going to go crazy out there. I think our mobile apps have improved and will continue to improve. And we like the value proposition we have. We\u2019re recognizing that we can\u2019t be everything to everybody, that\u2019s not what we do for a living, and but we have great value. We also like the fact that some of these other services are buying from us. Some of our top customers are some of those guys. So if we can\u2019t deliver that single unit of milk or cereal to your doorstep, someone that is may want to buy from us. Paul Trussell : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And you spoke about the impact to margins from an IT monetization standpoint. Could you just give us a little bit more detail about what some of the latest focus points have been in terms of system upgrade? And what we should be looking forward to you all tackling over the fiscal 2016 period? Richard Galanti : Well, going back, again, three years ago, we embarked on a pretty significant effort to really upgrade and monetize all our systems. Our systems were for the most part legacy systems, many of them written in-house. Many of them what I\u2019ll say were band-aided over the years and worked fine, but were arguably strained. Some of the systems that were included in that, that were not legacy were from outside suppliers that were not going to be supported going forward or had not been supported. And so we probably started a little later than we should have a few years ago. And we \u2013 and as I indicated over the last each quarter frankly, what we try to do is just show you really what the expense associated with those incremental efforts are. We\u2019ve installed a new membership system little under a year ago, I think, we installed a new point-of-sale system which is another deliverable if you will. There is a lot of small deliverables that I won\u2019t go into. We\u2019ve got several more over that are heading into the expense side and should be forthcoming over the next year to two years. The other thing I mentioned in terms of \u2013 I talk on the SG&A, on an incremental basis over the last few years, I think we\u2019re now up to something in the low teens, 12, 13 basis points, those twos, threes and fives that have added each year. And recognizing your denominator, your sales because our sales keep increasing, we\u2019re seeing all of the costs associated with it. I think we\u2019ll start to see benefits when we look out beyond 2016. Does it mean that this SG&A will not go up fewer basis points, we\u2019ll see, but we \u2013 there is a light at the end of the tunnel, sometimes it\u2019s long, some days it\u2019s a longer tunnel than others but we are starting to see some deliverables from it. So it\u2019s not a lot I can tell you about where the benefits are, there are clearly some benefits that we\u2019re going to see on the transportation side and some of the ancillary businesses like travel and other things. But the big switch over will be when buyers are buying on a new system a year or so down the road as well as the benefits in the transportation and other. But we don\u2019t want to put any dollars or basis points on those improvements. We had to do this if we want to double our size over a 10 or so year period starting couple of years ago with these expenses because we had a lot of systems that were really strained and this is going to set us up for the years to come. Paul Trussell : Much appreciated. Good luck. Operator : Our next question comes from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Oliver Chen : Hi, thanks a lot. Good morning, Richard. Regarding a bigger picture question, I was curious about your thoughts on what really sets you apart from other internet pure plays in terms of your supply chain and vertical integration and kind of this buying scale you have there? And then also international is a nice piece of the business just as we look at our models and talk to those part of the story, which countries do you have the most opportunity to increase share your store base versus maximum potential? Thank you. Richard Galanti : Sure. In terms of e-commerce, first we definitely chose \u2013 for us, we have a lot more items. We have 8,000 or 10,000 or so instead of 3,700 in store. That\u2019s a nit compared to everybody else out there that has hundreds of thousands, if not millions of items. I think what separates us is we\u2019ve got certainly we and others will have great quality merchandise. We\u2019ve got the best pricing overall. We work on margins that are at/or slightly below our reported total company margins but up there high singles, very low double digits. We will compare that to anybody out there. Again, we recognize we\u2019re not going to be selling single items to govern within an hour or four hours or overnight necessarily. But in a methodical way we think we are doing just fine and we think we have additional opportunities. And as I mentioned earlier, we are selling to a lot of these other guys that are wanting to deliver in certain unique ways. There is room for all of us. We\u2019ve got to keep, it\u2019s a big play out there in terms of market share and we think that we\u2019ll be able to take our share of that. Some little departments you lose a little, others you make a little, certainly we want people to still come into our warehouses. In terms of opportunities outside of \u2013 in terms of warehouse club growth opportunities, I think the first comment, for those of you on the call who have noticed for long time, the market potential keeps improving. I don\u2019t think we ever would have thought we had 60 or so locations in Canada, we never thought we\u2019d have more than 80, we now have more than that and we\u2019ll certainly be over 100 at some point in the next several years. In the U.S. we are expanding if you had asked me five years ago, when we are 80% U.S., 20% international, I would say five years hence or now it\u2019s probably 50/50 and going further South in terms of the percentage of openings in the U.S. We keep finding more opportunities here, so that\u2019s good news. In terms of our inventories, we think we\u2019ve certainly got a lot of potential in these three countries in Asia we are currently at. Bigger market of course is Japan, much bigger than Korea and Taiwan but we think we can go from the low-teens in each of Taiwan and Korea, double over the next 10 years but we\u2019ll see, so one at a time. Australia, we only have seven units in a country that\u2019s two-thirds or a little more of that population of Canada which has 80 or 90 and I\u2019m not suggesting we\u2019re going to have two-thirds of that anytime soon but we certainly can add a few there. Western Europe, we see \u2013 it\u2019s tough getting in with all the rules, regulations and permitting process but we are pretty interested to continue that process. Again, we\u2019ll open our second unit in Spain next month in Madrid and Getafe, a third unit \u2013 second in the Madrid area next calendar year and hopefully our first in France towards the end of the next fiscal year. So we think there is plenty opportunities. I think we feel comfortable that over the next five years we will continue to open 30-ish plus units a year and that we thought we would do that this year that just ended certainly in the high 20s, a few of those got delayed and that\u2019s life but we\u2019ve got a pipeline that\u2019s full. The international generally takes a lot longer for variety of reasons by country. And \u2013 but so we think that we\u2019ll continue to grow and do just fine in terms of that. Oliver Chen : Okay. And Richard, just a quick follow-up, there has been talk in terms of competitors in relation to how competitors are dealing with vendors. Could you just update us on your thoughts on your vendor relationships and any catalyst there given your buying scale and your leverage and your heritage, I was just curious on your thoughts. Thanks. Richard Galanti : I\u2019d like to think that the comment that we share internally and we talk to you guys about is that we are tough but fair. We are tough. We fight for member everyday and we \u2013 I\u2019d like to think that we do that as much if not more than anybody else. The good news about us in terms of our view of competitiveness is as we give the vast majority of any improvement back to the member and that in our view creates that moat that hopefully continues to get bigger. One of the challenges and opportunities we have is the \u2013 just the share size of our needs of various commodities, organics not long-staple cotton you name it. So we\u2019ve got a lot of efforts in that area that I think many of our competitors don\u2019t necessarily go to that level because they are dealing with vendors and lots of more items. And so I think we have some opportunities and challenges \u2013 but opportunities and challenges I think creates something special about us. I don\u2019t think anything is changed as we get bigger, we could be tougher but still fair and we work with our vendors. We think we have good relationships with them. We would assume that most of them would agree probably a few don\u2019t but we\u2019ll continue to be very transparent in how we deal with our vendors and we have very good relationships with many of them. Oliver Chen : Best regards. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Binder from Jefferies. Daniel Binder : Hi. Good morning. It\u2019s Dan Binder. My question had to do with ancillary margins, the last five quarters you\u2019ve had three quarters where ancillary margins were up about 15 basis points ex cash deflation and then two quarters where they were up substantially more than that. It happens to coincide with the declining gas prices and what I\u2019m trying to understand is how much of that gross margin improvement in ancillary is sustainable versus just being a function of the way gas was fluctuating during the quarter. Richard Galanti : Well, gas for I think most of the last five fiscal quarters on a year-over-year basis has helped a lot. But the other ancillary business continue to grow and whether it\u2019s optical or hearing aid or some of the other warehouse club businesses, all those things add up, travel you name it. So I think I hope it\u2019s sustainable, they are clearly gas \u2013 we have no illusion that some point in life gas prices go up and margin will be more normal relative to our history. Right now, it\u2019s good for our member in terms of low gas prices and good for us in terms of albeit a lower top line sales. It\u2019s been more profitable on a year-over-year basis. Daniel Binder : Okay. Then the other item I wanted to talk about was other income which I realized as a function of these FX contracts you talked about earlier in the call, always a challenge to model. I\u2019m just curious if FX rates were to stay roughly where they are today, how do you think that line item would look in Q1? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t know. All I can tell you is that, we look at it \u2013 we manage it in the sense that if you go to foreign country where some of their inventory purchases are paid for in dollars or euro sometimes but U.S. dollars is the bigger example, they will do \u2013 once they are comfortable with a price point that they\u2019re going to be able to convert at that level and sell goods in their local currency in their local country, they\u2019re going to choose to figure out how much of that they\u2019re going to lock in. Recognizing lock in just makes the control that price. If the local currency continues to weaken, that was good. If local currency strengthens relative to the U.S. dollar, they don\u2019t as much but we don\u2019t try to be completely writing away. So I think over the years in the last four or five years, that\u2019s a number that is probably ranged from plus or minus $15 million pretax, usually a little less than the number that we had this period where it\u2019s up about $15 million or so. But I would say it\u2019s \u2013 we just want to point it out because it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s going to be income statement. It\u2019s very hard to predict, I think by doing the way we do it, we\u2019re not going to ever have any giant surprise either way because of some drastic change in FX prices. Daniel Binder : And then the last item to share, repurchase picked up a bit this quarter, how you\u2019re thinking about it for this coming year? Richard Galanti : Well, we\u2019ll tell you each quarter it\u2019s part of our \u2013 what we do with our cash. As long as we feel good about our future, we\u2019re not going to ever be \u2013 we\u2019re going to buy on a regular basis, not try to take the market. I think the fact that we bought a little more this quarter as they start to come down a little bit but as I\u2019ve said in the past we buy a little more when it goes down and but we \u2013 I certainly feel comfortable about our future prospects as a company. So don\u2019t expect giant changes and how we\u2019ve been in the past. Certainly we trend in each quarter this year on an annualized basis upward and we are certainly comfortable at the current level. Daniel Binder : Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So, Richard, if you look at the three categories, the three broad departments, we saw some margin improvement. So two things, was there any common themes there in terms of maybe COGS doing a better job on your cost or KS mix, so any commonality there? And then if we kind of reached a point here because I assume the KS mix will continue to get better and how you buy that will continue to get better where there should be an upward drift in growth just secularly because there will be the elasticity of what you would choose to invest in, those merit right putting all of that back into the market price wise. Richard Galanti : I\u2019d like to think that we were that smart. Overall, we try to improve margins a little by lowering prices and I mean that sincerely and we\u2019re going to give most of that back to the customer to our member. As you know, we are pretty stubborn and intent on maintaining in a rising commodity standpoint prices on certain fresh food so we\u2019ve seen some impact there to the negative. I think you\u2019re right though as we continue to improve increased penetration of KS, that helps a little. Certainly as we\u2019ve had relative strength in departments over the last couple of years like Softlines and domestics and elsewhere in some of those items, we\u2019re going to improve that a little bit and that\u2019s of course outside of the ancillary and other businesses which in some cases were from higher margins as a starting point be it pharmacy or hearing aid center or optometry or whatever else. So but organics helps in a smaller way I mentioned in the past, not only organics relative to their substitute, the non-organic same products, organics sell at a higher price point but our view is that others while it may be competitive, we actually can be \u2013 we feel a more competitive framework and a little bit higher margin than on the underlying non-organic item. So it\u2019s really in our view a win-win for us challenge being getting more organic and that\u2019s not a challenge, that\u2019s challenge for us, of course, it\u2019s a challenge for everybody out there. So all those things help. I don\u2019t think we started the fiscal quarter and said let\u2019s see how we get an extra 10 or 15 or 20 basis points higher in a year-over-year. But we\u2019ll always try to improve a little as we know we have challenges elsewhere. John Heinbockel : And do you think and at least I\u2019ve noticed this particularly I think more in softlines, but do you think the quality of KS, it seems to continue to get better maybe at a faster pace even then it has in the recent past. Do you think that\u2019s fair, but the quality is getting better that\u2019s the investment not price point so much? Richard Galanti : Well, I think two things like on the softline side like apparel and everything we\u2019ve over the last year as we\u2019ve made a bigger effort in that area we took what sometimes would be a retail branded item at $200 or $300 for pair of slacks, that were $49.99, but when you go out by the same fabric and they could hopefully a very good quality item. And commit to a half a million or million units or so I think that helps. So we\u2019re always pushing the quality and the quantity and buying power of that and that quality value relationship continues to I think improve. John Heinbockel : Okay and then just lastly I don\u2019t think you guys have done a whole lot of data mining right with your membership base. Do you see that and does IT modernization allow you to do that. And then I\u2019m wondering when you think about sales sort of comp sales by comparable member I\u2019m just curious when you look going forward. Do you guys see a bigger opportunity to get and I\u2019m not saying the most loyal members maybe somebody a little bit below the top. To come in more frequently and that\u2019s a fresh food driver or more of an opportunity to get product and more items in the basket per trip. When you think about sustainability of comps by somebody\u2019s been member for well over three, five six years when do you see the bigger opportunity? Richard Galanti : Well, first and foremost we\u2019ve learned from doing virtually nothing to be a little more over minded about it I think there\u2019s a lot of low hanging fruit that we haven\u2019t done certainly there\u2019s more efforts in these areas in our membership marketing team on dotcom a little bit. But we don\u2019t do a lot with it, but we\u2019re doing a little more than we use to we must get I must get a call a week from some analytics company that wants to film stuff to do AB testing left or ketchup left or right of the mustard. We done I think a better job on our multi-vendor mailer in terms of that, but we have I think we have more opportunities that we\u2019ve even touched the surface on. But I\u2019m not suggesting that\u2019s going to be tomorrow afternoon. Marketing is definitely been told to try some new things and we haven\u2019t they generally work I do that more as something if things start to slow a little bit we have some opportunities there. But our first and foremost focus on just constantly driving quality and value on the products and services we sell. And that\u2019s we seem to have not figured out where the bottom of that is. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Drbul from Nomura Securities. Bob Drbul : Hi Richard good morning. I guess just have a couple of questions I think last quarter you had quantified the impact on the gas profit I think you said it benefit by a penny I was wondering if you could give us that same metric this quarter. And the second question I have is I think was some of the remodels that are going on. Could you just talk a little bit about category focus in the remodels and your expectation on what the returns in the comp uplifts we might see? Richard Galanti : Yep what was the first question I lost it. Bob Drbul : Gas profit\u2026 Richard Galanti : I think last quarter there was not a big impact it is a wash year-over-year it\u2019s more than a few cents, but not a heck of a lot we really don\u2019t talk about other than directionally, which way it helped us. Certainly I think four at least four of the last five fiscal quarters on a year-over-year basis it\u2019s been up, and more outsized the normal up. And the second question. Bob Drbul : Remodels, trend in remodels what would be the expectation that you see category focuses and how that might impact comp store sales as we sort of go through this? Richard Galanti : Sure, and keep in mind remodels I think of traditional retail stores remodeled they\u2019re doing a whole new front and new flooring and, new lighting fixtures I mean a lot of our remodels or everything. And we spend a lot of money on increasing refrigeration and frozen and in the fresh foods area that\u2019s to use as somebody mentioned earlier that\u2019s to use to be a driver of our business and certainly something we\u2019re pretty good at. We constantly try to figure out what locations that we don\u2019t have where we can put gas stations although we\u2019ve we\u2019re saturating that. There\u2019s certainly existing locations that are never going to have a gas station. But we still have a few out there and we\u2019re of course so that it\u2019s gas stations in the few other countries beyond just the US and Canada so there\u2019s little things like that. There\u2019s typically half a dozen or so units here where we\u2019re breaking out a wall buying some extra land perhaps. Adding 10 or 20,000 feet where it make sense and many times it make sense economically when there\u2019s some government incentives on solar that small dollar wise, but I\u2019m just coming out with some examples. So remodeling for us is just roughly sometimes improving and updating something, but lot of times just adding some more stuff, more feet of refrigeration is something that comes to mind in a bigger way over the last few years. Bob Drbul : And then just one question on the ancillary businesses. Can you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s happening in the photo business and trends in the quarter and sort of what the expectations are there? Richard Galanti : Well look you probably have our processing less photos than it use to it\u2019s actually about the businesses so profitability rises about flat year-over-year actual photos process is down. We\u2019ve and half of the business on a few other things with where everything from can this pictures to photo books to three four cartridges total cartridges and, but it\u2019s that\u2019s it\u2019s not a business that\u2019s going to come back tomorrow either. Of all the ancillary business is that one that it\u2019s big it\u2019s profitable it\u2019s not as profitable as it used to be, but it\u2019s and we\u2019ll continue to look in that space and see what we want to do. But we still have it and still we still try to figure out how to improve it. Bob Drbul : Thank you Richard. Operator : Our next question comes from Meredith Adler from Barclays. Meredith Adler : Hey Richard this is Meredith Adler. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about kind of what happened with the store openings this year, which I think met -- mixed your expectations I know some slipped into next year. But were there any common theme in that and when you look out the sort of nice number of openings from next year. Do you think that there\u2019s any risk based on what happened in fiscal 2015? Richard Galanti : Sure, there\u2019s always be risk I think prior to the fiscal 2015 for the few years leading up to that we actually got better on track of getting close to what we think is going to actually open. We put this is our original budget everything that if everything generally goes right. And we\u2019ve already and it\u2019s been green inked if you will it\u2019s been approved internally based on whatever permits and zoning issues and whatever all the issues are out there. We think we have it a decent chance of opening it we\u2019re going to put it in there recognizing inevitably there\u2019s always five or eight of those units that are budgeted four months 11 and 12 if not a few more that fiscal year maybe 10 units a year in that last month or two. And inevitably few of those fall out I think that we\u2019ll get closer than we did this year relative to our budget. Generally speaking it\u2019s not because we decided not to do a unit that we were going to do it. The only time that happens or virtually every time that happens is something, because something was became a big surprise and doing additional drilling we found something on the site that was a bigger issue. And that\u2019s by the way is generally not a risk, because when we do a site it\u2019s for virtually all of them nearly all of them we have to feel comfortable that we will be able to do it before we commit to it. Meredith Adler : Okay, so there wasn\u2019t any. Richard Galanti : I think we get closer. Meredith Adler : And there wasn\u2019t any common theme to the ones that didn\u2019t open this year or got delayed? Richard Galanti : No it\u2019s everyone\u2019s unique story, but it\u2019s just typical delays weather, zoning, other surprises that are unrelated to competition or anything else out there. Meredith Adler : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning thanks for taking my question. Can you give me more detail on the traffic trends on not only this quarter, but over the last few years. Are you seeing more of the growth comes from the middle of year of the membership base. Presumably the most frequent members are tapped out they can no long \u2013 they cannot grow the number of times they\u2019re going to Costco. So then most are coming from the mid tier berth of the membership population or is it more like the least attached members are getting a little bit more attached? Richard Galanti : Maybe people our membership and operations know little more than I do here I \u2013 and maybe there\u2019s some more opportunity. Overall overtime shops go up as people are making more each year as they\u2019re having family whatever those issues are. And so certainly an older member in terms how long they\u2019ve been a member and that increase several time. But it\u2019s a lot of things it\u2019s the merchandising, it\u2019s the frequency drivers like fresh foods or gas, it\u2019s that incremental shop, because somebody always that needs a maintenance prescription. They got to the age where they\u2019re going to come in a one extra time a year, because of their timing of their need for a cholesterol reducing drug or whatever. So it\u2019s a lot of little things plus a few of those things notable things like fresh foods and gas. It\u2019s also executive membership, it\u2019s also the co-branded card and rewards and it really is all of the above I don\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s different reasons clearly when we have new members whether it\u2019s was new millennial members or 20 years ago new gen whatever members. They buy less when they start they buy more over time I can\u2019t tell you what millennials are going to do relative to their predecessor age groups overall not just a Costco, but overall buying. If they have smaller houses and they drive a little less and they buy fewer sofas, that is that is not good for anybody, but at the end of the day we think we\u2019re getting our share. Michael Lasser : Okay, and my follow-up question is how do you notice or how do you observe your membership population responded to different types of promotions. And when I say promotions I\u2019m talking about pricing expense rewards through your card maybe the new merchandise offers. And can you give us what\u2019s being most say what\u2019s been most impactful and how is how the response is into drive up back it hasn\u2019t been to allowed you to side out more members. Thank you so much. Richard Galanti : Well first of all we\u2019re not going to share all the specifics, but at the end of the day it\u2019s a little bit of all of the above. We work every day to try to improve the value proposition to the member. We work every day to try to upsize and either where it make sense, because we do lot more things and more dollars in that basket. We maybe something like the multi-vendor mailer with the couponing that grew dramatically from what was originally a six or eight week summer item summer couponing booklet to 11 or so times a year for three plus weeks each. And over time we and our vendors figure out what works best and what starts to slow down. So those things keep getting tweaked. So again there\u2019s we focus on trying to improve the value we if we can get if we can sell you a bigger pack size of the greater value we\u2019re going to do that I think that\u2019s a catch too. We don\u2019t just want to increase the size of something 50% and sell off at the same price per ounce or price per number of units. We only want to raise it for the most probably we try to raise and only the quantity or the quantity when we feel lower the price per unit to the member and that\u2019s serves us well and serves them well. So it\u2019s that\u2019s our religion. Michael Lasser : Sure I\u2019m thinking more about the card does that have as much influence in the members purchase decision or frequency as pricing or coupons for example? Richard Galanti : Well, I don\u2019t know one has more or the other we know that the executive members shop a lot take a through \u2013 take a group of 100,000 members out of are similar in terms of shopping patterns and age groups, and 10 year as a member. And they\u2019re both growing those both of those groups are growing roughly the same rate each year. Get half of the convert to a executive member and you see a dramatic change in their buying habits, but that\u2019s no change that we have seen over the years that I think that surprises me personally is the continued penetration of that area. And maybe we\u2019ve got little better in store of doing that clearly loyalty programs worth whether it\u2019s our executive member program or a reward based program credit card. And one of the things that\u2019s long-term exciting for us is. We feel that we can continue even on our co-brand card, continue to improve the value proposition to our member, which hopefully gets them in here more often. But that\u2019s what we do every day. Michael Lasser : Sure. All right good luck with the upcoming year. Thank you so much. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Benedict from Robert Baird. Peter Benedict : Hey Richard, thanks for taking my question. A couple here. First of all, can you talk about the new member signup trends in the fourth quarter I didn\u2019t hear if you did mention that I apologize I know they were down slightly in the third quarter? Richard Galanti : They\u2019re actually up in the fourth quarter year-over-year a combination of decent member signups and the existing warehouses probably a few more international units in the quarter on a comparable year-over-year basis in the quarter. I think we\u2019re up a little over 2 million members in the quarter from the area in terms of new signups. Peter Benedict : Okay, great and then I mean you mentioned when you gave the regional color you said that Texas was good. But can you talk about maybe chance in some of the specific energy markets again like Houston maybe somewhere it\u2019s up in Alberta like and you\u2019ve seen any kind of moderation in traffic or ticket or what have you? Richard Galanti : I just don\u2019t have that amount of granularity in front of me. Peter Benedict : Okay and then the thought process behind repatriated cash from Canada why now and then you\u2019ve got $1.2 billion that comes during December any thoughts here to refinance that or payoff? Richard Galanti : At this point we\u2019ll probably pay it off point of the repatriation is Canada is a very profitable country so it\u2019s we\u2019ve built up cash balances at some point we determined on an ongoing basis we will determine whether we feel this to be permanently invested up there or not. And at such time we\u2019ll make that decision I think we\u2019ve done that twice. About a year ago we\u2019ve brought back a little over billion dollars. And in this case it was favorable from us a small favorable from a tax perspective. A year ago I think third to fourth quarter a year ago it was slightly unfavorable, but again we determined but small. We determined it was the right time to bring it back from a reinvestment standpoint. Peter Benedict : Okay fair enough and last question just on CapEx $2.8 billion or $3 billion this year from a double you did maybe a few years ago I understand you\u2019ve got some of the investment you\u2019re doing the higher store growth. Is that a level you think is one that we should assume hold for several years assuming you can open 30 plus stores per year or are some of the investments you\u2019re doing in IT and systems and distribution to those kind of taper off a bit maybe in the years to how you\u2019re thinking about that? Richard Galanti : I hope IT tapers of a little, but it\u2019s that\u2019s not the biggest piece of it. I think and certainly couple of those things it\u2019s going to be the $2.5 to $3 range as that $2.8 to $3.0 this year a $102 that likely to be $102 higher than the following year maybe I don\u2019t see that $2.8 to $3 going to $3.5 next year. So yeah something of the high 2s is probably a good guess through for next years. Peter Benedict : Yeah, okay that make sense thank you. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : Hey thanks for taking the question actually had some follow-ups and some of the questions were already been asked, but I want to get some clarity. So I think the Michael Lasser, was asking about the Visa card and I guess real specifically do you anticipate that card will actually drive membership growth Richard? Richard Galanti : Well we get there we\u2019ll let you know. Scott Mushkin : Okay, okay and then following up a little bit on John Heinbockel and his kind of the technology. When you\u2019re looking at your executive members do you guys have clarity to the data say okay how many are these executive members using our ancillary services what are they using and kind of what the penetration rates are? Richard Galanti : Yes absolutely, but we\u2019re not going to share with you what those are. Each ancillary business is a little different, some of them take a decade to really get some good footing. But they are all great values and yet another reason why somebody wants to be a member and we\u2019ll keep improving those values. So those are \u2013 whether it\u2019s KS, or organic, or commodities, or these items, these are all things I think that gives us a good competitive position. Scott Mushkin : And do you think there\u2019s an opportunity to drive additional ancillary business growth with your core members? Richard Galanti : Absolutely. Scott Mushkin : Okay, then\u2026 Richard Galanti : I would recommend that you try Costco Travel, you\u2019ll be amazed. Scott Mushkin : I\u2019m working right now at a Costco car buying program, so I hear that\u2019s wonderful as well. Richard Galanti : As well, I think, we\u2019re approaching 0.5 million car \u2013 new cars a year on that. And there\u2019s a reason, we use our buying power to get our members a great savings on cars. Scott Mushkin : And when you think about getting a little bit more involved in technology and relationship with your customers is one area that you think could be a level that could be thrown? Richard Galanti : I\u2019m sorry, say that again? Scott Mushkin : When you\u2019re looking at data mining, knowing your customers a little bit better, marketing a little bit more aggressively, I think, you mentioned at the beginning as a scenario that would get a focus do you think? Richard Galanti : At some point, we kind of little self deprecating when we talk about that. At the end of the day, there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to do a lot of that stuff. We kind of look at it in the 80-20 rule, we\u2019re doing a little of it, which you\u2019re getting some benefits. There will be plenty of opportunities to do some of that in the future. But we \u2013 our main focus is on driving value and a lot of those other things take care of themselves. And certainly Craig Jelinek as our CEO has told people, an e-commerce people and membership marketing, try some things and they\u2019re trying some things, and we\u2019ll keep go in that direction. Scott Mushkin : Perfect. And I had just one last kind of follow-up, this is when Bob was talking about the remodels, I\u2019m trying to understand that our local Costco is under remodel in the fresh department. And as you look at 2016 and 2017, is that the focus of the remodels, are you expecting to do more of them, and it\u2019s just focused on fresh, it seem like that\u2019s where the focus. I just wanted to get clarity and is it going up kind of year-over-year? Richard Galanti : I think as a general rule, it has been going up. But it\u2019s up, it\u2019s a big number. And I don\u2019t know if it keeps going up from there. I know the one across the street here, we again added 10,000 feet or 15,000 feet. We expanded greatly the walk-in coolers for customers and produce and dairy. When you\u2019re doing in some of these units $200 million, $250 million, $300 million, you can drive some true incremental good sales by not only expanding the \u2013 everything in terms of the traffic patterns ingress in and outside of the warehouse. But adding some of these things like refrigeration, fresh foods, and they\u2019ll still continue to be a big number. Scott Mushkin : And so you\u2019re doing more fresh remodels, fresh drives traffic, is the focus in that fresh area on organic, or just general, or is it related towards organics? Richard Galanti : Well, I think in terms of CapEx related, it\u2019s everything. Our organics is just a piece of that. Scott Mushkin : All right. Perfect. Thank you so much. Really enjoyed the answers. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. Gone over an hour, and I still have a couple of questions. So, one of the follow-up on gas, what was the average gas price in the quarter versus last and if you could give us the gallon as well, that would be great? Richard Galanti : The average price in Q4 was 365 a year ago and 288 this current fourth quarter, so down 21.2%. Greg Melich : Right. And if that\u2019s the case, I guess, going back to gas profitably understanding it\u2019s been a tailwind. I guess, is that incremental drop even from last quarter that\u2019s really allowed the profitability to boost up again. Is that \u2013 are we thinking about that right? Richard Galanti : Actually the price was \u2013 from a quarter ago, the price was up about $0.20 a gallon. But it\u2019s \u2013 I think, there\u2019s a little bit of new normal, it\u2019s not just how it is year-over-year, it\u2019s when it\u2019s low, it\u2019s better from a profitability standpoint, and it\u2019s relative to competition. I mean, gas buddy has continued to say that we\u2019re the lowest price out there nationally, and I think we\u2019re still pretty good at being very competitive that we get a lot of good kudos for that. Greg Melich : So basically you can keep your competitive advantage, but the penny profit might be better than it used to be the way the market is? Richard Galanti : Yes. I think in \u2013 when prices are low, we make more than we used on average per gallon or per gas station, and that\u2019s good. Greg Melich : Right. And then the second question was going back to membership fee income, I think, you said it was 6% if we exclude FX? Richard Galanti : Yes. Greg Melich : I believe that\u2019s a 100 or maybe 200 bps below the trend in the last year or two. Is that just fewer openings last year, or I think last quarter you mentioned sign-ups per club was actually negative, but it was a comparison issue, just help us understand how that\u2026? Richard Galanti : I think, overall it\u2019s just fine. There is a little bit in Canada of the auto renewal issue when we switch over and we\u2019ll see that again a year hence over the next year, starting next year, that\u2019s a small piece of it. I don\u2019t think beyond that there\u2019s a whole lot there in that regard. There\u2019s always going to be the timing, because when membership fee dollar increases, we use deferred accounting for it. And so that makes it a little more squishy number, but overall the number was in line with what we felt was pretty good. Greg Melich : And with the auto renewal effect, I guess, I\u2019ll sneak a third one in. If I remember correctly, AmEx is roughly 40% of the tender in the stores. So to think of the magnitude that have in Canada when you did the changeover, what was AmEx\u2026? Richard Galanti : Well, there\u2019s one big difference in Canada, the portfolio was not purchased. While I can\u2019t guarantee, it will be purchased, the contract states it should be, and we\u2019ll keep towards that, our Citi and AmEx are working towards that end. That\u2019s a different scenario in terms of auto renewal. Up there, you basically have to re-sign people up, they have to apply for credit. They get their \u2013 they get authorized. They have to re-sign up for auto renewal. I don\u2019t expect that to be an issue in the U.S. Greg Melich : Got it. And the tender there is roughly the same as here at 40%? Richard Galanti : I think it was a little less, but remind you the market share of our provider up there historically had a lower market share there relative to Canada than they do in the U.S., have a stronger market share down here. Greg Melich : Okay, got it. Great. Thank you. Richard Galanti : Yes. Why don\u2019t we take one more question? Operator : Our final question comes from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thank you so much for keeping the flame burning just for another moment. First question relates to Spain and just curious on your learnings from your first Spain opening and how you expect your continental European stores to differ from your other international markets based on what you saw from that first unit? Richard Galanti : Well, like any first unit with maybe the exception of Australia, which was off the charts high to start with, you learn a lot. You learn what sells and doesn\u2019t sell. I think, if I recall from when we first opened in Saville year-and-half, two years ago. We had a less \u2013 we had stronger non-food than we would have expected and not as strong fresh food. Usually in a few market you got stronger fresh food. This given us great success in countries like Korea and Taiwan and Japan. We have to remind ourselves that Korea and Taiwan, they were not very good for several years. You start off with slower sales in most countries other than Australia and when you first entered \u2013 when we first entered the market, and that was consistent, probably the worst economy we started was in Spain, but we\u2019re seeing some traction. Membership sign-ups are just fine, and membership renewals have been just fine. But it\u2019s \u2013 one data point does not a story make here. Madrid is certainly is a much bigger market than Saville, and we\u2019ve got again one unit coming next month and a second one in around Madrid coming, I believe next spring, certainly, sometime in the mid of the calendar year. So that will be more telling in our view than anything we\u2019ve seen so far. Matthew Fassler : Great. Richard Galanti : We continue to be very confident that we got a good model that works, and we\u2019re patient as well. Matthew Fassler : A quick second question. On the online and e-commerce piece, Instacart, I know, is a particularly prominent partnership among the ones that you\u2019ve got, and it\u2019s a concept that from a \u2013 in terms of the number of retailers who is doing business with and how long that\u2019s hung in, seems to be gaining some traction. Any sense as to how that relationship has evolved, in particular, how the economics look for you relative to some of the alternatives? Richard Galanti : Well, again, we\u2019re not going to disclose any specifics, we have a good working relationship with Instacart with \u2013 certainly with Google Shopping Express as well, and Instacart is in more cities, and anybody you know out there that wants to buy from us, you call us. Matthew Fassler : Fair enough. And then finally, I think Greg \u2013 one element of Greg\u2019s questions might not have gotten answered was gallon comps. You talked a bit about the gas prices. But I remember, when gas prices first started coming under pressure, gallon comps surged into double digits, are you still seeing that with that prices down here today? Richard Galanti : I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s double-digits, but it\u2019s certainly positive. Matthew Fassler : Got it, okay. Richard Galanti : And we generally have that out sometimes in a moment of weakness I share it with you guys. But the comps have continued to go in the right direction in terms of gallon. Matthew Fassler : Thank you so much. Richard Galanti : Okay. Thank you, everyone. Have a good day.",

Operator : Good morning. My name is Brandy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO, sir, you may begin your conference. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Brandy, and good morning to everyone. This morning\u2019s press release reviews our first quarter of fiscal 2016 operating results for the 12-weeks ended November 22. Before I begin, please note that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. To begin with our 12-week first quarter of fiscal 2016, for the quarter, our reported earnings per share came in at $1.09, $0.03 below last year\u2019s reported figure of $1.12. There are several items of note, six to be exact, that impacted this year over year comparison of Q1 earnings. First, FX in the first quarter, the foreign currencies where we operate were weaker year over year versus the US dollar, primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea, such that foreign earnings in Q1 when converted into US dollars for reporting purposes were lower by approximately $42 million, or $0.10 a share, than those earnings would have been had FX exchange rates been flat year over year. The big weaknesses started about a year ago, while I certainly don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow and there\u2019s been continued weakness, certainly the biggest impacts looks like the last four quarters. One of the benefits, of course, is purchasing land and building units in some of these countries was little cheaper over the last year. Number two, stock compensation expense was $36 million higher year over year in the first quarter or $0.05 a share. We have over 4,600 people who receive restricted stock units. For many of them, it is a significant part of their annual compensation. These grants are made annually each October in our fiscal first quarter. While these grants typically vest over a five-year period, accelerated vesting occurs when a recipient reaches 25, 30 and 35 years of employment with the company. So factors driving this $36 million increase included additional levels of accelerated vesting given the rising number of employees achieving long tenure with the company. This, by the way, is most impactful each Q1, given our October RSU grant cycle. Two, appreciation in our stock price and of course the larger number of employees in the plants. I\u2019d like to note that because of the significant price appreciation in our stock this past year, this year\u2019s annual RSU grant, which occurred in late October, was reduced by an average of 12%. That is the number of RSUs granted to each recipient. So while there was a $36 million year over year increase in Q1, in the upcoming second, third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year, the anticipated year over year increases are estimated to be about a third of this dollar amount in each of the fiscal quarters. So $0.01 to $0.02 earnings year over year impact each quarter in second, third and fourth quarters versus the $0.05 a share impact in Q1. Third point I\u2019d like to note, there are two SG&A items that together negatively impacted this year\u2019s Q1 earnings. In the first quarter, we recorded a $22 million charge related to two non-recurring legal and regulatory matters. The $22 million figure represented an 8 basis point to SG&A and impacted our first quarter earnings per share by $0.04. Point number four, IT modernization, as discussed in each of the past many quarters over a couple of years now, our major IT modernization efforts continue to impact our SG&A expense percentages, especially as new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In the first quarter, on an incremental year over year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by an estimated $20 million pre-tax, or 7 basis points, 6 basis points without gas deflation which is about $0.03 hit to earnings in the quarter versus last year. Point number five, last year in the first quarter, we did call out that we had a $17 million benefit to gross margin related to a non-recurring legal settlement. So that benefited last year\u2019s first quarter by $0.03 a share. And lastly, point number six, our cobranded credit card transition in the US. As you know, when we transition into a new cobranded credit card relationship in the US next year, as we wind down our current relationship, new cobrand signups have greatly slowed and in fact are for now ceased. The short term negative impact related to moneys we earn for new cobrand signups. Year over year in Q1, this represented a $15 million or $0.02 per share hit to our earnings. This will continue to be a small negative impact to earnings in Q2 and Q3 and possibly into Q4 based on timing, at which time I\u2019ll be able to better outline how the new relationships should directionally impact our future results and the future rewards to our members under the new cobranded credit card program. I look forward to sharing more information at that time. So six items of note, adding it up, it\u2019s about $0.27 of impact to our year over year earnings comparison. I know many of these things you may have in your numbers; I know some of them you don\u2019t. Turning to our first quarter sales, in terms of sales for the quarter, our 12-week reported comp sales figure for Q1 showed a minus 1% decrease, plus 2% in the US, minus 9% in Canada and minus 5% in other international. As we stated in our release, if you take out the two big impacts of gas price deflation year over year and the impact of negative FX, the plus 2% reported US comp would have been a plus 6% in the first quarter, the minus 9% in Canada would have been a plus 9% and the minus 5% other international would have been a plus 7%, such that the minus 1% reported comp would have been a plus 6%. And as we reported last Wednesday in our November sales results for the 4-week month ended November 29, our comp sales increase excluding the impact of FX and gas was similar to the 12-week first fiscal quarter, with total company comp increase of 6% and again ex gas and FX in the US of plus 6%, in Canada a plus 8%, in other international a plus 7%. In terms of opening activities and plans, we opened 13 new locations in Q1, including two relos, for a net of 11 new warehouses during the quarter which ended November 22. That included seven in the US, one in Canada, one in Australia our 8th in that country, one in Japan, our 24th in Japan, and our second in Spain, just outside of Madrid, in Getafe. That\u2019s our second unit in Spain. Two relocations were in Woodland Hills, California and Teterboro, New Jersey. In the second quarter, we had two new business centers planned to open, one each in Westminster, California and in Hackensack, New Jersey. And for all of fiscal 2016, we have a current plan to open up 32 net new locations. That could come down a little bit based on timing as we get into the second half of the year, a few may be delayed, but that\u2019s our current plan. Of those, assuming we\u2019re able to do all 32, 22 of them would be in the US, three in Canada, two each in Japan and Australia, and one each in the UK, Taiwan and Spain. Later in the call, I\u2019ll review with you our e-commerce activities, our membership trends, additional discussion about gross margin and SG&A in Q1 and recent stock purchase activities. Again, very briefly, sales for the quarter in reported were up 1.3% to $26.6 billion, up from $26.3 billion a year ago. Again, on a comp basis, reported number was down 1%, but ex gas and FX was up 6%. For the quarter, our minus 1% reported comp sales results were a combination of an average transaction size down 4% for the quarter. Again, taking out gas and FX, it would be up 3% excluding those items and an average shopping frequency of about 3.5% for the quarter. In terms of sales comparison by geography, geographically for Q1, the better operating performing regions in the US were all three regions in California and the Midwest as well. Internationally, in local currencies, the better performing countries were Australia, Taiwan, Mexico and Canada. In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, during the quarter, which we look at September, October and November, excluding FX and gas, within food and sundries, which were up in the mid single digits year over year, sundries, [meat] [ph] deli and spirits were the relative standouts. Our hard lines sales were up in the mid to high single digits for the quarter. Majors are electronics came in positive first quarter in the low double digit range. In addition to electronics, better performing departments included hardware and garden and patio. Within the mid single digit soft line comps, domestics, women\u2019s apparel and home furnishings were standouts. And in fresh foods where our comp sales were in the mid to high single digits, produce was at the top of the four sub-categories. Moving down to line items on the income statement, membership fees, in the first quarter membership fees were up 2% \u2013 2 basis points up $11 million, coming in at $593 million versus $582 million a year ago. Again without FX, the dollars would have been up 6%. I noticed in several of the preliminary notes from some of the sell-side analysts out there, they had expressed some questions about the strength in membership and I might point out a couple of things. In addition to being up 6% ex FX, on a cash basis, there was about another percentage point higher than these numbers as well anecdotally a year ago we did a couple of things outside with social media which we didn\u2019t do, small impact year over year, but something versus nothing. In terms of membership, we continue to benefit from good signups in existing and new locations, continued increasing penetration of our $110 a year executive membership and strong renewal rates, averaging up to 91% in the US and Canada and averaging up to 88% worldwide. Our new membership signups in Q1 year over year company-wide were up 7%. In terms of members at Q1 end, gold star came in quarter end at 34.7 million, up from 34.0 million at year-end. Primary business, 7.2 million at quarter end versus 7.1 million a quarter ago. Business add-on remained at 3.5 million. So total memberships, 45.4 million at quarter end, up from 44.6 million and including extra cards, 82.7 million cards out there versus 81.3 million 12-weeks earlier. At Q1 end, paid executive memberships came in at 16.4 million, which was an increase of 307,000 or 26,000 new executive members increase each week in the 12-week fiscal first quarter. As you know, executive members are over a third of our member base and over two-thirds of our sales in those countries where executive membership is available. In terms of renewal rates, in the US and Canada, at quarter end, we were at 90.6%, rounded up to 90.6%. We rounded down to 90.5% at the end of Q1, that\u2019s the impact that I mentioned a quarter ago in Canada with having to re-signup the members with a new credit card program, a de novo program. That was a small impact. I think there was [indiscernible] in the US, perhaps based on what I said earlier. Total worldwide remained at 87.8% at quarter end and at fiscal year end. Going down to gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the quarter was up 26 basis points, coming in at 11.29%, up from 11.03%. As you know, gas deflation is a big impact to these figures, so I\u2019ll give you a couple of numbers, I\u2019ll ask you to write down the normal four columns. For all of fiscal 2015, columns one and two would be reported and then without gas deflation and then two columns for Q1 [indiscernible] reported without gas deflation. And of course, these basis points figures are the year over year change from a year ago. Merchandise core reported was plus 11 basis points for all of fiscal 2015, but without gas deflation was minus 12 basis points year over year. For Q1, it was plus 24 basis points and minus 3 basis points. Ancillary businesses, for the year, plus 29 basis points and plus 23 basis points. For the quarter, plus 11 basis points and plus 4 basis points. The 2% reward, minus 4 basis points and minus 2 basis points. And for the quarter, minus 3 basis points and minus 1 basis points. LIFO for all of last year was at a 5 basis point pick up both for reported and without deflation and for the quarter was plus 1 basis point and plus 1 basis point. Other, for the whole of last year, plus 2 basis points reported and plus 1 basis point without gas deflation. And this year that nonrecurring legal settlement impacted \u2013 benefit in gross margin a year ago such that it was minus 7 basis points reported and minus 7 basis points without gas deflation. End of those columns for all of fiscal 2015 reported gross margin was up 43 basis points, but up 15 basis points ex gas deflation. This year Q1 reported up 26 basis points, but without gas deflation minus 6 basis points, with minus 7 basis points of that minus basis points be the one-time benefit a year ago. So again, overall, those are the numbers. In terms of the core gross margins which is the core business, food and sundries, hard lines, soft lines and fresh foods, as a percent of their own sales, they were positive year over year in Q1 by 13 basis points and they were higher year over year across all four of these merchandise categories, with both hard lines and soft lines showing stronger year over year improvement than the year over year improvement in food and sundries and fresh foods. But nonetheless, all four were positive year over year. Ancillary and other business gross margin was up 11 on a reported basis, up 4 without gas deflation in the quarter. Many of these businesses, gas, pharmacy, food [indiscernible] all showed higher year over year gross margins as a percent of their own sales. Offsetting this a little was slightly lower e-commerce gross margins, but overall positive there. The 2% reward was higher year over year due to higher sales penetrations for executive members. This impacted gross margin in Q1 by 3 basis points to the negative, 1 basis point to the negative ex gas. LIFO, last year at Q1, we had a $2 million credit representing slight deflation in the US inventory pools and a credit of $5 million this year, also relatively small, but in that pick up of a basis point year over year in terms of that recovery. Lastly, I mentioned, the quarterly adjustment, a 7 basis point hit in terms of the comparison benefiting a non-recurring benefit last year versus nothing this year. So overall, gross margins excluding gas were down 6 basis points year over year, but up 1 basis point excluding that one-year charge, that non-recurring benefit from last year. Moving on to SG&A, our SG&A percentages Q1 over Q1 were higher by 28 basis points, coming in at 10.54% this year versus 10.26% last year. But excluding gas deflation, were lower or better by 2 basis points. I\u2019ll go into some details and you\u2019ll see that the core expense components of that actually were pretty good. So again four columns, columns one and two would be fiscal 2015 year reported and without gas deflation and then columns three and four would be Q1 2016 reported and without gas deflation. First line item, core operations, minus 6 reported and plus 16 without deflation for all of last year on a year over year basis. In Q1, 0 and plus 26. Central, minus 7 and minus 5 for the year and minus 8 and minus 6 for the quarter. Stock compensation, minus 5 and 4 for the year and minus 12 and minus 10 for the quarter. Quarterly adjustments, nothing last year in columns one and two. This year, minus 8 and minus 8, that represents that $22 million item that I mentioned early on. So total, last year for the year over year we reported SG&A up or minus 18 basis points. And without gas deflation, better or lower, so plus 7 basis points. This year, higher by 28, so minus 28 basis points in the quarter reported and without deflation plus 2. Within operations, again without deflation, showed plus 26 or lower by 26. Within that, our core warehouse payroll was better year over year in the mid to high single digits, benefits were lower or better in the high single digits and the combination of other expenses, a variety of them, were better by or lower by 10 basis points year over year. So again, it\u2019s kind of the core control of our operating expenses were all in pretty good shape this quarter. Central expense was higher year over year by minus 8 or minus 6 basis points without gas. As I mentioned earlier in the call, increased IT spending related to modernization showed higher year over year costs of 7 basis points, 6 without gas deflation. I already mentioned earlier the stock compensation which was 12 basis points or 10 basis points without deflation. I also mentioned that again because of certainly the stock price increase, but also importantly the fact that there is more employees hitting 25 and in some cases 30, in a few cases 35 [indiscernible] the total impact for the year, more than half of it based on our estimates is the impact in Q1 with about a third or less of that amount in each of the coming three quarters year over year, so still it\u2019s going to be higher year over year, but not as high that increase was in Q1. Finally, quarterly adjustments, again related to the $22 million non-recurring legal and regulatory items that I discussed, so overall good expense control, there\u2019s plenty of things and hopefully I\u2019ve been able to elaborate to shed some light on the components of that. Moving down the income statement, pre-opening expense was higher by $11 million or 4 basis points higher. We had nine openings last year, including one relocation; 13 this year including two. There\u2019s other pre-opening items in terms of countries and some other things, but overall no big surprises there. Our total reported operating income in Q1 was down $3 million from $770 million last year to $767 million this year. Below operating income, reported interest expense in Q1 came in at $33 million versus $26 million a year ago, so lower by $7 million. Interest income itself was lower year over year by about $4 million and the other component was lower by $3 million year over year, that\u2019s primarily related to various FX related transactions. Sometime that\u2019s a positive, sometimes that\u2019s a negative, never that meaningful for the year in its entirety generally. Overall, reported pretax income was down 2% versus last year, coming in at $762 million, down from $779 million pre-tax a year ago. Again, several items impact the year over year earnings comparison which I discussed earlier in the call. In terms of tax rate, our corporate tax rate this quarter was up about a percentage point, coming in at 36.1% compared to last year\u2019s first quarter rate of 35.2%. The higher tax rate year over year resulted from a few discrete items going to the increasing tax rate not reducing it and to a little extent lower earnings penetration from our foreign country operations where tax rates are generally lower than our income tax rates for the United States. Now, for a quick rundown of other topics, the balance sheet as in the recent past is included in today\u2019s press. I\u2019ll point out a couple of items. Depreciation and amortization for Q1 came in at $271 million. Accounts payable as a percent of inventory on a reported basis was pretty much the same year over year, last year it was 101%, this year 100%. Taking out non-merchandise payables, last year in non-merchandise payables as a percent of inventories was 92%, this year at quarter end it was 90%. Average inventory per warehouse on a reported basis was up a little over 3% or $524,000 to $14.9 million. Again, ex FX, it would have been up about 6.5% or $960,000, assuming flat FX. About $250,000 million is electronics and what we call majors and about $160,000 is apparel, both built up inventory heading into the Thanksgiving week, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. As you could have extrapolated from our number, our November reporting, where we reported the four weeks of November, the 12-week first quarter and the 13-week retail reporting calendar [454] the implication there of course was that the last week which is really the first week of Q2, which is Thanksgiving week, was pretty strong. The balance of the departments have been selling well, like hardware, housewares and toys, so really no issues in inventory levels going into the last few weeks before calendar year end. We\u2019re in pretty good shape. In terms of CapEx, in Q1, we spent a little over $700 million and our estimate for the year is to be \u2013 most likely CapEx would be high $2 billions, say $2.8 billion and $3 billion. This compares to CapEx last fiscal year of $2.4 billion. In terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend continues at $0.40 a share, or $1.60 annualized. This represents a total annual cost to the company of around $700 million. In terms of stock buybacks, in Q1, we bought back a total of 898,000 shares for $130 million at an average price of $144.88. Next topic, Costco online, we\u2019re now in five countries, having launched Korea November 10. We\u2019re in the US, Canada, UK, Mexico and Korea. For the first quarter, sales and profits were up over last year. Q1 e-commerce total sales were up 15% on a comp basis, a total and comp basis, up 19% on a comp basis excluding FX. And again, it represents a little over 3% of our sales. We\u2019ve been asked a lot of how, again, the week of Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you name it, e-commerce sales were quite strong, up 28% and up over 30% in local currencies. New initiatives, again, it was few years ago that we re-platformed the site. We\u2019ve continued to improve our mobile apps and there\u2019s room to [indiscernible] efforts with our inline efforts. We\u2019ve added a few categories like apparel, hard line, KS items. We\u2019ve greatly improved timing of shipments by shipping out more than just one depot across the country. And again, we\u2019ll expect to see e-commerce and other international markets in the future. In terms of some of the others out there that are buying from us, we continue to provide merchandise for sale on the Google Shopping Express. This is now being offered in six markets, Bay Area has recently been expanded, LA, Manhattan, and more recently Chicago, DC and Boston. We\u2019ve increased our offerings in categories and currently testing fresh foods available in a limited group in each of the San Francisco and LA markets. We\u2019re also providing merchandise to Instacart now in 16 markets throughout the United States, Boxt in three markets and we\u2019re also doing some business with Jet.com in the three cities where they have their distribution centers. Outside of here, Alibaba Tmall, we currently offer just over 200 SKUs on the Tmall site, with a heavy emphasis on Kirkland Signature items. It\u2019s going well and we\u2019re certainly building some recognition for the cost going to Kirkland Signature names. We had a very successful Singles\u2019 Day on Alibaba Tmall receiving over 300,000 orders. Next on discussion, expansion, again, last year opened net new units of 23, so about 3.5% square footage growth. This year, again, plans for up to 32 units. If we achieve that, it\u2019d be about 5% square footage growth and I already mentioned where those would be. Also as of Q1 end, some of you want to know what our square footage is, at Q1 end, it stood at 1,547,000 square feet. Lastly, our second quarter fiscal 2016 scheduled earnings release, that will be for the 12-weeks ending February 14, will be after the market closes on Wednesday, March 2, with earnings the following morning on Thursday, March 3. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Brandy and be happy to open it up for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee. Charles Grom : First question, a lot of moving parts with some of the one-time items, I know you guys don\u2019t give guidance anymore, but I\u2019d be curious how the quarter overall performed relative to the expectations that you would have budgeted back in August? Richard Galanti : We beat them. Charles Grom : You beat them? Okay. Second question, when you look at new member sign-ups, how has the trend been by age group? I\u2019m curious your ability to attract younger customers given the success of Prime and other programs out there. Have you guys started to look at the signups by age group, et cetera? Richard Galanti : We have and I don\u2019t have the most current month\u2019s detail, but from a month ago budget meeting, we\u2019re getting \u2013 first of all, the average age of a Costco member has come down. I think a few years ago, we were about four years older than the average in the US, now we\u2019re a little under two years older. About a third of our new signups in recent months have been millennials and albeit I\u2019ll make it a point and provide a little more color on that each quarterly earnings release. Charles Grom : The last question for me just on the gross margin, it\u2019s the first time in a long time that all four categories have been positive. Just curious if you could provide a little color maybe by category what\u2019s driving that? Richard Galanti : I think the one that\u2019s historically in the last many quarters, that\u2019s always the one that\u2019s a little volatile and volatile is mostly defined as down year over year is fresh foods. And that has to do with the fact that commodity prices have increased, we maintained prices. No doubt, things like rotisserie chickens and the like. And I think there\u2019s been a little bit of deflation in some of those categories and some meat, but also our volumes are particularly strong. When you got a low double digit comp in produce as an example, that\u2019s going to help you, because its sales are strong, availability of products is good and spoilage is less. So those are the types of things that help you in fresh foods. I think the strength in electronics has probably helped us. Those are the things that come to mind. I don\u2019t have \u2013 organics is helping. Organics, as I mentioned before, it\u2019s kind of a win-win for us. We get for us a fuller margin, a more fair margin within the confines of what we limit ourselves to and it in our view creates even a greater competitive mode given that\u2019s where sometimes retailers will try to make [war] [ph]. Charles Grom : And your organic penetration stands at what at the current time? Richard Galanti : Organic, $4 billion plus, it\u2019s still growing very strongly, but I don\u2019t have the detail in front of me. Sorry. Charles Grom : Okay, great. Thank you. Richard Galanti : One other point on the soft lines, our apparel has been pretty strong too in terms of apparel basics. And so that\u2019s generally a full margin business. Operator : And your next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : Richard, a question on the fresh food deflation and I guess maybe it behaves a little bit differently by category. But if you think about meat and dairy in particular, is that less of a benefit to you margin-wise and more of a volume benefit just because you pass the declining prices through more quickly than most of your competitors by design and so it\u2019s probably more of a help to volume than margin or no? Richard Galanti : Yes, it\u2019s more of a help to volume. If anything, we\u2019ll bring price down and we\u2019ll always err to the low side. So if we have a calculated margin that\u2019s making the numbers up, but $8.15 a pound is going to be $7.99, so you have all those things working towards that. John Heinbockel : The price elasticity on that is pretty high? Richard Galanti : Price on strip steaks or items like that, yes. When you could hit another dollar a pound, if you will, lower or a few dollars a pound on some items that drive business. And needless to say you\u2019ve been in Costco and talk about massing out big good-looking stuff, that\u2019s fresh foods is where we shine. John Heinbockel : You said e-commerce growth was down a little bit. Is that purely mix? Richard Galanti : There\u2019s been no comment, nothing that was called out specifically why that is and that\u2019s so I\u2019d assume it\u2019s mix. John Heinbockel : And lastly, the leverage that you\u2019ve gotten in core operations was better than we\u2019ve seen in a couple of quarters. It\u2019s pretty broad-based. Is there anything you\u2019re doing differently whether it\u2019s managing labor, benefit design that would have \u2013 because comp wasn\u2019t that different versus prior quarters. So is it something you\u2019re doing internally to manage those items? Richard Galanti : I wish we knew more here, but I mean, everything we do every day and I\u2019m not trying to be cute here, but certainly we continue to focus on things like basics like overtime hours, every four weeks when we have an all-hands budget meeting here, each of the 16 or so senior VPs or country managers of operations get up and talk about things that they\u2019ve done in their region to be more efficient. And I think that pays off. We have focus items that they talk about each month; they talk about other things, working with buyers to create more seamless movement. All those things we really spend a lot of time on. One of the things that I think benefited us are assumptions for healthcare cost, notably US where it\u2019s most expensive and it\u2019s most inflationary, we\u2019ve done a little better job of that. It was little over a year ago that we made a few changes in the plan in terms of primary caregivers primarily within the plan, and that changed a little behavior, not that big of an impact to the employee, but a better management of that. So I think we\u2019re still getting a little benefit of that there. But it\u2019s in the core payroll as well and I think that\u2019s a combination of lots of little things like I mentioned. Operator : Your next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Curious if you can help diagnose the consumer, I know we saw some volatility in your monthly comps and there\u2019s been some unevenness in other parts of retail. You gave us some good color in November, but what do you think is going on? Does spending appear back to normal? I don\u2019t know if it was just a temporary hiccup? Richard Galanti : I remember, it\u2019s October when we said one month does not make a trend. And then the first couple of weeks of November weren\u2019t terribly exciting and then it got more exciting. And middle of November and late November, it was quite a bit stronger than the first part of November. So again, I think we weren\u2019t really concerned when it was \u2013 when frequency was a three instead of a four, but overall comps continue to be well, our markdowns are in good shape, even though inventories a little higher, and so I think we still feel cautiously optimistic and certainly confident about what we\u2019re doing right now. I think if you\u2019d ask me what surprised me in the last month versus the last couple of months, electronic has finally turned and that\u2019s I think a function of people coming in, pricing keeps coming down. I think our fresh foods has been great. The fact that many times I\u2019m explaining the fresh foods year over year margins are down a little, they were up a little. That\u2019s all good. So I think that reflects well on us. I can\u2019t speak to the consumer outside of that though. Simeon Gutman : So other than electronics, the complexion of what consumers are spending on looks back to normal, back to the old cadence? Richard Galanti : Yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean anything for tomorrow. But what\u2019s nice when I look at the November results which I have in front of me, underlying in the US which is the big piece here, so it does take \u2013 relates the FX issue. Soft lines was low double digits, fresh notwithstanding some deflation and the average sale in meat was good. Yes, and so I hope it will continue, stay tuned. Simeon Gutman : And just a follow-up gross margin because I guess the printed number is the highest number since our model goes back to 2003. And you mentioned the four core categories were good and I think you attributed somewhat to mix. But big picture, the mix of product, that will probably keep benefiting you. Can you give us a sense on the leverage with suppliers? How much of that side of the coin is helping you as well? Richard Galanti : I haven\u2019t heard anybody talking about major changes in leverage. We are \u2013 I think if you ask our suppliers generally, we are typically front and center with them. When freight rates have come down as you might expect some suppliers are reluctant to \u2013 they are waiting for us to call them back to offer that. Global sourcing I think is helping us competitively a little bit. So overall I think we\u2019re still tough. I mean, there have been some suggestions out there that some retailers going back to manufacturers to insist on extra moneys. When we read that and hear that, we hear it from as you might expect and we have to understand that there\u2019s some people out there that sell all of this and we share things each way. You\u2019re going to find \u2013 we\u2019re going to go back and make sure we get our share of that. So I think we continue to be tough; I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any change in that. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Can you describe what you\u2019re doing to prepare for the transition to VISA? And as you make that transition, how are you going to inform your existing members and new potential members of the switch? Richard Galanti : I\u2019m glad a lot of that\u2019s in the operations and membership marketing areas. There\u2019s a lot going on, needless to say, between our company and the new issuer Citi that\u2019s going to be coming out. Citi and American Express are currently discussing what they need to be doing in terms of that transition. And again, contractually there\u2019s not a lot we can say at this point, but rest assured it\u2019s going to take several weeks to transition, but the assumption is that the existing members with the existing cobranded card will be getting new cards in the mail on or about the time of the actual transition. And it will be hopefully as seamless as possible to them. Once we\u2019re allowed to communicate to our members about the new program, which again contractually we can\u2019t do that until that time, as you would expect like anything we do, we\u2019re going to let everybody know and put it in big letters. Michael Lasser : Should we factor into our models a potential disruption from the transition? Will there be a period of when you take both VISA and American Express for a period of time? Richard Galanti : There may be, again that\u2019s still influx. There are some possibilities of that. But whether there\u2019s an exact transition, a binary transition or an overlap period of time, I don\u2019t really see a lot of disruption on that side. As you might expect, it\u2019s a royal pain to do this, but it\u2019s what we do. You\u2019ve got teams of people in operations that are working with our people in membership marketing and they are working with the new outside provider to make it as seamless as possible to have the communication out there both in store, via email, via letter. And so I think it\u2019s going to go a lot better than one might think. It\u2019s just a lot of work to be done. Michael Lasser : Coming back to the topic of traffic, three out of the last four months traffic has been a little slower than the 4% you had been seeing consistently before that period. Are you just running into a point where there\u2019s now either limitations on how frequently some of your members, some of your most loyal members can shop or limitations on the throughput that some of the stores are having based on the level of traffic that you\u2019re already seeing in those locations? Richard Galanti : I think in terms of the level of throughout, we keep doing a better job of that. We keep \u2013 in my view, in my own calculations, we keep raising the number of amount of annual volume a warehouse can do. Certainly, there will be somebody in line saying God, why did I come on Saturday afternoon, but at the end of the day that\u2019s not an issue. Look, I remember in calendar 2009, for calendar 2009, the first year after the bad economy hit, we had a frequency number of around 4. And I was reminding people that if calendar 2010 was zero, that compounded number of plus 2 for those two years would have been better than our average over the prior 20 years. And now we\u2019ve enjoyed seven years, calendar 2009 through calendar 2015 that have been slightly above 4 on average on a compounded basis. So at some point, it has to come down a little bit. We feel very good about where it is. We can\u2019t look at any specific factor to say this is why it used to be a 4, in the last couple of months it\u2019s been a 3.5. We feel very good about where it is. Operator : Your next question is from Robbie Holmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Holmes : Richard, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about partnering with Instacart and Google and maybe how that\u2019s going versus your expectations. And also, can you remind us how the membership is impacted by that if it were to roll out nationally? How does membership fee get accounted for in that? And then I have a follow-up question. Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, each one is a little different. I believe with Google, you have to be a Costco member to go through the Google Shopping Express network. So it doesn\u2019t impact membership at all, perhaps it gets a few members because there are some people that aren\u2019t going to come in, but now they can get some things delivered to them. With respect to Instacart, I believe it\u2019s the Instacart memberships and of course they buy multiple memberships. Net-net, it might be a slight decline [Technical Difficulty] all trying to grow their businesses. So I think starting from the point that many out there were concerned, everything is going to go this way and what\u2019s going to happen to all this brick-and-mortar. In our case, we see some changes. The net increase in some of these is that there is a slight improvement in total comp, recognizing you\u2019ve got a few more visits that are delivered. But it\u2019s still a very small thing. And so there\u2019s not a lot of knowledge I can give you beyond that. Robert Holmes : Just the other question was on with the success in fresh food and organic and everything, are you seeing space allocation grow to that area? And if so, where is it mostly been coming from and is there a maximum [Technical Difficulty]. Richard Galanti : [Technical Difficulty] refrigerator and frozen, putting in more vertical stand-up coolers versus the coffin coolers in the deli and cheese areas. So we\u2019re getting more out of our space. We\u2019ve added space. My guess is that there\u2019s less incremental space that we can do, but we\u2019re still doing it to some extent. And the other thing is that\u2019s an area where we can benefit by turning it faster as well. So a lot of our expansion was to enable us to turn it fast, not only more square footage or more lineal footage outdoors that are more vertical cases, but have more merchandise out there, better presented and easier to grab. And I think we\u2019ve done a great job in that area. Robert Holmes : Lastly, the CapEx I think you\u2019re saying is going to be up like $0.5 billion or so versus last year. Can you remind us what that extra $0.5 billion compared to last year is for? Richard Galanti : Sure. Roughly eight or 10 more locations, roughly a few more extensive locations internationally. There is all that other stuff I talked about where we\u2019re adding \u2013 still adding a few gas stations, still adding a few hearing aid centers. Depots, our infrastructure which is we think a big competitive and profitable advantage to us. 84%, 85% of our goods now go through our cross-dock operations where the average life of the majority of that inventory is less than a half a dozen hours. So we\u2019ve got a lot there. I believe IT is \u2013 I don\u2019t have it here. I think that will be \u2013 year over year it\u2019s going to be $60 million to $80 million. I don\u2019t have it in front of me. I\u2019m sorry. But that\u2019s a piece of it as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JP Morgan. Christopher Horvers : So Richard, I understand your comments on the MFI growth and the underlying trend being very strong. But as you look at the MFI ex FX, it seemed to have slowed off a strong four quarter trend that you saw through the third quarter of last year. So how much of this is social media offers? Are we lapping some big international openings as well? Basically trying to understand what the right underlying trend in MFI growth is. Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t see a big concern there. Some of this is social media. And I know anecdotally one thing we did was living social thing a year ago which was very good. We\u2019ve not done that again at the corresponding time this year. I\u2019ve not seen any comments from our membership marketing people when we reviewed the quarter with them of any concerns. There maybe a little timing with openings, international openings, but again we don\u2019t see any big trend there that concerns us in terms of trend change. Christopher Horvers : No trend change? Okay, understood. And then can you help us think about the gas? I know you get this question a lot, but you had some nice gas benefits last year. In the next quarter, you\u2019re going to lap I think what was an even stronger quarter, the second quarter a year ago. So maybe anything on how much gas was a net benefit or a net detriment on a year to year basis, quantitative hopefully, but any qualitative comments just to help as we think about this upcoming quarter? Richard Galanti : We\u2019ll tell each quarter, but in Q1, again, one would have thought, one includes you guys and me, that gas profitability would have fallen down a little bit, still very good, historic relative to our history, but versus very strong numbers of Q1 a year ago. We had pretty good numbers this time. I think year over year it was within $0.01 of profitability, flat to down less than $0.01 year over year. I think we also had a very strong Q2 profitability that may be tough to match, but we\u2019re early in the quarter. And Q1 surprised me, I can only be surprised there, but if it does come in a little bit, we\u2019ll certainly share with you if it\u2019s more than a penny or two delta. Christopher Horvers : So a tougher compare but you were surprised to the upside on this case and taking that all into account maybe it\u2019s not as bad as people fear out there? Richard Galanti : Right. Again when I say surprise to the upside, we are still down year over year a shade, but again last year was pretty strong and Q2 was even stronger. We\u2019ll see how this quarter goes. In fact, if gas prices and oil prices drip down a little bit, that generally bodes well for us. But again, I\u2019m not suggesting it can be as low as last year, we\u2019ll see. Christopher Horvers : And just one last question on the traffic side, I know you said you don\u2019t really see a change in the box in the consumer. Does the fact that November was largely driven in the back half of the month concern you at all or is that just an indication of the consumer continuing to wait for the deals that come around Black Friday? Richard Galanti : If I knew I\u2019d be doing something else, we actually looked at it as a positive. We were starting to get a little concerned is it\u2019s slowing down a little bit. I think the fact that we don\u2019t put as much emphasis on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, it still did well. But we\u2019ve got a lot of people coming in earlier that week for crazy numbers of pumpkin pies and the like, all those things can help us. The fact that electronics was strong was a surprise to us. So I don\u2019t think we look at it that way at all. Operator : Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : I apologize for any background noise. I am in the airport. But I wanted to just go back first to your color that you provided on margins just to make sure that I captured some of the details that you listed out. When it comes to gross margins to start, I believe you spoke to the actual core of four categories up once again 13 basis points, similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. You noted that ex the cycling of the one-time benefit from last year, gross margins would have been up an additional 7 basis points. And regarding the inventory levels, you stated that you feel pretty comfortable with those levels just given how strong the first week of the second quarter was. Is that a fair representation of your color on gross margins and how should we think about that going forward? Richard Galanti : Yes, but mind you the 7 basis point is a one-time item. The 13 is the core business, it\u2019s not like this 13 becomes 20. Paul Trussell : Correct, on the core, absolutely. Richard Galanti : Yes, we feel pretty good about that. Paul Trussell : And then regarding just SG&A again, just for my clarification, making sure my table is clear. Stock compensation, you mentioned was up meaningfully year-over-year, $36 million I believe you said. So about a $0.05 hit or so on a go-forward basis. That will only be about a third of the hit in the next few quarters? Richard Galanti : What I\u2019m trying to convey is that because of timing, our annual grant to everybody is in late October, because more and more of the recipients, particularly the recipients like myself who has been here 32 years, almost, so you\u2019ve got accelerated vesting. So the entire hit is now not spread over 5 years. So really that\u2019s a timing issue; that\u2019s going to help you a little in the future. But the fact of the matter is because it\u2019s October, we\u2019ve got a big hit in October or Q1, so just taking in the math of what we \u2013 if you think about it, the actual hit to P&L this year is a function of those grants that have been made over the last five years and then [indiscernible] adjusted when it vests faster than that accelerated based on tenure. So not only do you have more people on the plan today than you had \u2013 as a piece from five years ago gets fully extinguished and you\u2019re adding a new piece, A, this new piece has many more people from five years ago; it has a stock price per share a lot higher; and you\u2019ve got the vesting. The vesting in my view being one of the key ones. And so the way it hits, just simple math is that $36 million year over year change is more than half of our expected year over year increase in that line item. So if it was half, in each of the next three quarters, it\u2019d be about a third of 50% in each of those quarters. It\u2019s not quite there, but instead of being $36 million, it\u2019s going to be in the $10 million to $13 million range or $8 million to $13 million range each period. Paul Trussell : And then the legal hit, is that fully contained into this particular quarter? And then also on the IT modernization, how should we think about the cadence of those expenses going forward relative to what we saw in 1Q? Richard Galanti : In terms of the $22 million, again, it\u2019s a couple of items that we\u2019re still in the process of. That\u2019s our best guess of the impact. We don\u2019t think there is going to be any big surprises there. If anything, you try to be reasonable and conservative. Outside of that, in terms of IT modernization, it\u2019s a little bit of a broken record here, but there is light at the end of this tunnel incrementally, and I\u2019m hopeful that sometime next year we will see that flatten out and come down. But we got a lot going on there. And again, it\u2019s part of our operations. It will come down as a percent of sales at some point in the future or come down certainly relative to the type of increases we\u2019ve seen. But it\u2019s necessary and we\u2019re starting to see some deliverables finally. Paul Trussell : Last for me is just on the international side. Canada and international segment have been able to have a reasonable spread versus the US in margins. I believe some of that\u2019s due to a little bit maybe less competition, maybe a little bit less labor costs. As you continue to grow the business and expand into new markets, how do you think about the margins in those segments going forward? Can it maintain a little bit of a reasonable spread versus the US? Richard Galanti : I think all things being equal Canada is going to continue to be more profitable than the US and some of these other countries are going to continue to be even more profitable than that, not all, but some of them. We have no illusion that some of the ones that are really outsized profitable come down a little overtime, but Canada is mature, still growing a little in terms of new units, still growing nicely in terms of local currency comps and it\u2019s nice that we\u2019re the only club in town. That being said, we\u2019re still are own toughest competitor. We have a little extra margin there, not a lot. We have a lot lower healthcare cost as a percent of sales. So there is other things that help us up there, not just little extra gross margin. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : The question I have, Richard, you called out electronics as a point of strength. Could you comment specifically on the TV category? And to what extent some of the new innovations in TVs are helping drive better electronic sales? And a follow-on to that is as the holiday season has gotten underway, what type of price promotions you\u2019ve seen throughout the sector on TVs? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t have the quarter in front of me, but for the four weeks of November reporting which would be through the Sunday after Thanksgiving, those four weeks ended then, within majors which was up again ex FX in the mid teens for the month, I think I said it was in the low double digits for the quarter. TVs for the month were up both in dollars and sales in the mid 20s. So it\u2019s quite strong. That maybe because last year was a little weak. I don\u2019t know; I don\u2019t have that in front of me. But it certainly was strong. I think there is a little bit more promotions; cell phones are strong; tablets are strong \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, tablets have come down a little bit, but phones are strong and those are the big things. Video games are strong, again all those other strongs or little weakers are dwarfed by television sales within electronics. I think the technology, the 4K is helping, but the prices are coming down as well. I was there across the street yesterday and you\u2019ve got smaller flat screens with great quality less than $200. You got bigger TVs less than $1,000. You got as well the giant HD 4K whatever under $3,000 and under $2,000, depending on the size and some of the new technology. So I think all those things are helping us a little bit on that category. I pointed out also because it\u2019s one of those we continue to get asked about as .com continues to take market share in electronics and the impacts to other brick and mortars over the last few years. I think Best Buy has been a little better on TVs as well, but certainly this has been a standout for us of late. Brian Nagel : And one follow-up question. I know you addressed this in your prepared comments too, but the inventory growth in the quarter, so if you look at it on a year-on-year sequential basis, it did tick higher here in fiscal Q1. What explains that? Richard Galanti : The two biggest components of that $900,000 ex FX number year over year is electronics which is about $25,000 and that\u2019s planned [in new and find] as expressed in these sales numbers. And apparel and again we are out there in mass and these are basics, I mean, we\u2019re not going to be left over with lot of red and green Christmas dresses, because that\u2019s not what we sell. I mean, we\u2019re doing fine. We feel we have no concerns about our inventories, our markdowns, something I know we\u2019ve learned years ago the cheapest markdown is the first markdown and the quicker you get rid of stuffs that that had problems and our markdowns overall have been nothing to be concerned about. Operator : And your next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : My first question just want to get a little more clarity around this transitional period as you have to cease signups for the card, you talked about it in terms of EPS impact on the quarter that you just reported and some residual impact over the next couple quarters. As we think about where this shows up in the P&L, is there any discernible impact on the top line? And if you could kind of dimensionalize the impact on the member fees as well just to understand where we would model for that to happen? Richard Galanti : We don\u2019t have any new cobrand cards being signed up right now. So that\u2019s impactful a little bit to the membership line, not a lot. 99% of \u2013 that\u2019s going to go to sales. Everybody who has a cobrand card currently is still using it. So there is no impact there. Again, what I tried to do recognizing that $1.09 reported figure was going to raise some questions, we just looked at what are the things that we can really look at. Given that our sales continue to be strong, we\u2019re not really looking at that line to see how much sales do we estimate we\u2019re losing. I assume we\u2019re losing, in theory, you\u2019re losing a sale for somebody that signed up as a member that can\u2019t sign up for the cobrand card. They are still buying from us, they don\u2019t have the cobrand card, they don\u2019t have that reward. They\u2019re probably using some other Amex reward card, recognizing at its current strength, Amex is about 40% of our sales. There are still 60% of people that aren\u2019t using Amex, whether they\u2019re using debit or a very old house card from \u2013 we don\u2019t own it, some years ago or another Amex card. So we don\u2019t see a big impact there. Is it greater than zero, the negative impact, of course, but again given where our sales numbers have been, this is something that there is specific pieces that moneys earned for new signups in the equation and so we pointed that out. Matthew Fassler : Second question, you talked about the seasonality of stock comp expense and the bulge you saw this quarter. Just to confirm what you talked about we saw this past Q1 and what you talked about for the rest of the year. It seems to be seasonally a lot like what you had last year even though it\u2019s a bit different from what you had over the prior few years. Is that an accurate way to think about it? Richard Galanti : Yes. By the way, comp is \u2013 it is part of our comp and it is part of SG&A. We have always pride ourselves for many years we never changed the number of shares. So as the stock compounded at 19% a year, that piece of 3,000 or 4,000 people\u2019s compensation improved dramatically. As you may recall a couple of years ago we reduced the number per recipient at whatever level that was by I think 15% and again we just did it again in the grant that just happened, notwithstanding you\u2019re still seeing this big increase because of just how that works. Matthew Fassler : And just another quick follow-up on the demographic piece. You gave us a couple of interesting numbers. A couple different ways to come at that question I guess, is the average age of a new member changing for you? Has that been moving in one direction? You talked about it relative to the national average and presumably that couldn\u2019t happen without the average age coming down. But without knowing what the national average has done at our fingertips, kind of hard to know. And then also, members in multifamily dwellings versus single family, if you think about millennials staying in that kind of environment and multifamily in general gaining share from single family. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re able to look at it that way. Any sense of how you\u2019re faring with that cohort? Richard Galanti : I haven\u2019t seen anything that\u2019s presented to me that way. I\u2019ve said a couple of times in the last many months when people talk about millennials, I think the good news is we\u2019re getting more of them and things like organic certainly help, social media helps a little bit, but millennials is going to be an issue for the total pie in general if people move home after college for a period of time, if they move into a smaller place, if they get married later and if they have fewer kids. It\u2019s going to rain on all of us, so we\u2019re certainly having increasing the share we get on those people who will help, but we\u2019re going to keep driving value. And given the flexibility of the types of things we can continue to sell, we\u2019ll see where it goes. But we have not looked at that. If we start looking at that, I\u2019d be scared. Operator : Your next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Steven Zaccone : This is Steven Zaccone on for Oliver Chen. Thanks for taking our questions. Just two quick questions. As you look to the remainder of 2016, are there any areas of the assortment that you have an opportunity for improvement in your view? And then secondly, we just had a quick question regarding the E. coli situation. Have you seen any traffic disruption from the headlines? It does appear that you have the situation contained but just curious have you seen any traffic disruptions? Richard Galanti : On the latter, no. That was contained pretty quickly and the information was communicated pretty quickly. And I believe that the last possible episode related to Costco of someone being fallen ill was November 1, so we\u2019re trying to pass that. Thankfully nobody was extremely hurt. There were a couple, there\u2019s a few that did go to hospital and I understand that they\u2019re all doing better now. So nothing new as it relates to that. And in terms of the other question in terms of what\u2019s new, again it\u2019s more of the same. I can\u2019t give you anything specific at the top of mind. Organics continues. At KS, we\u2019re doing a few more things, but that\u2019s steady as we go. Operator : Your next question is from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Just wanted to ask another question on the transition to Citi. As we get closer to that transition in the spring, just curious how you feel about it? Sounds like there is a lot of preparations involved. And maybe you can just remind us what\u2019s different about this in the US versus what you did in Canada a couple years ago? And maybe what you learned in that transition process? Richard Galanti : Well, it just takes time. I think the big difference is in Canada the new issuer was not able \u2013 did not purchase the portfolio from American Express and therefore it\u2019s what referred to as a de novo program where our customers, members have to sign up and reapply for credit. And so that\u2019s a little more disruptive. Now, it\u2019s a MasterCard up there and so there are many people out there that have a MasterCard in his or her wallet already. So it\u2019s not something they use. And then in terms of auto renewals, part of our renewal rate is the fact that you have some members that do auto renewal, which as you might expect statistically has a slightly higher renewal rate because it\u2019s auto. And the assumption here in the US is that the portfolio will be \u2013 the transition will include the purchase of the portfolio and I think the language which we\u2019ve used in the past is that that\u2019s what we anticipate because there is always a chance that something can happen, but we\u2019re working towards that end as you would expect the issuers out there. So again, recognizing that Canada is 10% of our company and the US is 70%, so these are bigger numbers. I would guess that if you look at the $15 million I pointed out as it related to just revenues we get for signing up new cobrand cards, even if the same percentages occurred up there, it wouldn\u2019t either be worth calling out in terms of the company as a whole. So it\u2019s just going to take some time. I\u2019m just trying to share with you what I can at this point. Nothing big is going to happen, we\u2019ll get through it, and we\u2019re very excited about the next many years under a great program. Kelly Bania : Any color you can provide on what percent of members do use the auto renewal and anything else we should think about just modeling? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t have that at my fingertips, but I probably would \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t share that. As many as possible would be the answer. It makes it easier for the customer and certainly it gives them a reason to more likely renew. Kelly Bania : And then, just another question. You mentioned I think two new business centers planned for this year. I was just curious if you could talk about how those are working? Any relative profitability versus a typical club and just what you think about that format going forward? Richard Galanti : First and foremost, we\u2019re opening regular warehouse clubs. For a number of years, we had anywhere from I think six to eight business centers that were doing okay, slightly profitable, but not setting the world on fire. There were a lot of changes that was made to it a couple of years ago and they are growing nicely. They are more profitable than they had been. And it\u2019s another avenue, it\u2019s going to be a lot smaller footprint in terms of how many units we have than a regular warehouse, regular Costco warehouses, but we\u2019re doing this just like we\u2019ve done everything pretty methodically. On a base of 10 or so, we\u2019re going to open a couple. And so it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve discovered something that we\u2019re going to go from 10 to 20 overnight in one year. So yes, it\u2019s good and it\u2019s a positive business for us and it certainly is a focus on the business member. We also from time to time identify items in the business center that makes sense to sell in all of our locations. So we think it\u2019s a positive. Some of the examples also is where we\u2019ve taken an old Costco which is smaller footprint, perhaps not as well located for our general population member, as we\u2019re relocating an old unit, we will convert that other one in that city into a business center. So that\u2019s been helpful to us as well. We did that in South Atlanta; we did that in Chicago I think in Bedford Park. I believe the New Jersey location is a relocation where Hackensack went to Teterboro. So I mentioned that we opened a new one in Teterboro that\u2019s a re-lo of Hackensack which is now over that several month period is being converted into a business center. So we think it\u2019s good. When asked what\u2019s driving our earnings growth and what\u2019s driving our whatever, I\u2019ve always said it\u2019s a lot of little things and this would be one of them. Operator : Your next question is from Meredith Adler with Barclays. Meredith Adler : I have one quick question. Can you just remind me of the timing of the new credit card? Richard Galanti : Our current relationship expires March 31 and there is a window of few months there post that this could extend. So it will be sometime between April and December is my best guess at this point. Meredith Adler : And then you guys are still working very hard on your technology modernization. Can you talk about whether you\u2019ve been pleased with the timing of everything and whether all the new systems have been rolled out smoothly? Technology is notoriously late, but how is it going for you guys? Richard Galanti : Smoothly would be an overstatement. I mean, I think in the beginning of time when we talked about this starting about three or four years ago, we said this is our best guess and I have jokingly said whatever you think it\u2019s going to do it\u2019s going to take twice as long and cost twice as much. Anybody that\u2019s gone through it, I think generally experiences that. We are experiencing some level of that as well. That being said, we\u2019ve got everybody\u2019s supportive of it. The deliverables that we have had, sometimes they\u2019ve taken longer, they\u2019ve cost more. We\u2019ve learned from what we didn\u2019t know. As we find out, we do a better job on the next thing. And so again overall I think it\u2019s costing a little more than we thought, it\u2019s taking a little longer, but we\u2019re getting some deliverables. Over the last year, like the new membership system, a new point-of-sale system, a big roll out of really the foundation of our accounting system will be at the beginning of the new fiscal year. So we got a lot going on, but we\u2019re getting through it. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t quote about it because we know it\u2019s tough and it takes long time, but we\u2019re getting there. Operator : Your next question is from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky : Richard, can you give us a little bit of color or some range on how many stores might be opened this year? You said 32 on the top end. How low could that be and where would you expect some of the shortfalls to be? Richard Galanti : 32 is my best guess. If I had to guess what\u2019s the low end, 27 or 28, that just simply means \u2013 under 27 example, that means five in the latter half of the year in the original budget that\u2019s skewed out a little bit. Right now, I\u2019m looking, we\u2019ve got seven new units coming in Q3 in this plan and 15 in Q4 with about half of those, probably eight of those in August. So I\u2019m sure a few of those is going to slip. Okay, some of those have slipped out because this number was 35. So I\u2019m guessing 28 to 32, again it\u2019s a fluid number. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve lost any, but I know a couple of them we\u2019ve already delayed, might be a year delay for zoning issues. One example there, again we found some things underground that original core testing didn\u2019t find. So you\u2019re always going to find some things out there like that. Chuck Cerankosky : Can you talk a little bit about a competitive behavior that you\u2019re seeing out there whether it\u2019s a reaction of a more conventional stores to what you\u2019ve been doing? There\u2019s not many retailers out their showing the comps that Costco is. Are you seeing any reaction in your channel and outside your channel and especially as you enter some new countries? Richard Galanti : Overall, no. I mean, we are \u2013 and I\u2019ve said this many times, we are our own toughest competitor and I mean that, in our industry, notably Sams and to little extent BJs, but certainly many locations where we compete head to head. We\u2019re in their locations literally every week and I would assume they are in our locations every week. And we feel good about the competitive posture there. I think it helps our average volumes are dramatically higher and that allows you to do a lot of things and I think the nature of our member. So I don\u2019t think we see any big changes there other than where we keep doing pretty good. As it relates to traditional competitors, regionally we look at all kinds of things. In the Northeast, we look at companies like Wegmans, which is a great supermarket retailer that are opening more units. That\u2019s in our view our customer, high end customer particularly in the quality of fresh foods, although our fresh foods numbers are pretty good. So I think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job. We\u2019re helped by the fact that we can choose to do things like women\u2019s athletic wear, active wear where we could literally create $100 million of sales on full margin items that didn\u2019t exist a few years ago. And I think our global sourcing initiatives and things that gives us we believe an edge on things like produce, but you can\u2019t do it if you don\u2019t do the kind of volumes we do. So I think we\u2019ve got some good advantages out there and we are, I think, one of the best and not resting on our laurels. So in terms of .com, again, we\u2019re pretty methodical about it. Some of the things we\u2019re doing are helping, albeit from a [Technical Difficulty] lot of ways and I think we\u2019re getting better at that too. Operator : Your next question is from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : I just wanted Richard to get your thoughts here and maybe have the numbers even, what the penetration rate for e-commerce and services like rental cars and travel services and that type, insurance services, what the penetration rate is among your members? And if you have, has it been growing? Richard Galanti : They\u2019re growing nicely. We do not give out that information. They\u2019re all pretty good businesses. They\u2019ve all grown slowly overtime. Travel is doing very well. Things like car rentals, I can tell you I visited some shareholders recently on some proxy issues and during that I was just giving an example though of our rental car business which has grown dramatically in the last year to well over 2 million rentals a year and a lot of that is online. And in two different meetings, individuals who prided themselves on knowing how to get the best deal on car rentals went online during the meeting and were able to save of the same car from the same [Technical Difficulty] try it and we got to do a better job of communicating that. So those businesses are growing. They are all generally small percentages of the total, so I think that creates more opportunity for us. I think I read recently where if we were a car dealer, we\u2019d be the second largest car dealer in the country based on the number of new cars purchased by our members through the Costco auto program. All those are additional reasons to be a member. They\u2019re all very profitable and growing. And if they\u2019re very profitable, it means we\u2019re going to keep getting even better values. So it\u2019s all good. Scott Mushkin : And your e-commerce penetration rate, do you have that or is that something you don\u2019t want to talk about either? Richard Galanti : E-commerce, in terms of \u2013 what do you mean by penetration? Scott Mushkin : What percentage of the members are using your e-commerce offer? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t have that in front of me. It\u2019s probably not as much as it should be and it\u2019ll keep growing. And I\u2019m not trying to be cute, I just don\u2019t have that number in front of me. Scott Mushkin : And when we\u2019re looking at these things and we\u2019re looking at frequency, I would guess that these are outside your frequency, they don\u2019t get counted, is that true? Richard Galanti : Correct. Our frequency is front end transactions at the warehouse. So it doesn\u2019t include gas, pharmacy, optical. If you shopped at front end, no matter where else you shop, it\u2019s just one transaction. So if you shop just at the gas station, it\u2019s not a transaction in terms of our shopping frequency. Scott Mushkin : And the e-commerce is not ringing up as transactions either? Frequency? It\u2019s transactions but not frequency. Richard Galanti : E-commerce is like a warehouse, so that is adding up. That is 3% of our business. So even if it\u2019s growing at 3 times at 20-plus percent versus 7%, it\u2019s de minimis to that number. Why don\u2019t we take two more questions? Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Drbul. Robert Drbul : I just had two quick questions. On the credit card, the $0.02 hit this quarter, is that expected to be something similar over the next few quarters in terms of the impact? I guess the question is when you start to get to the new relationship, will there be additional marketing expense that you would also incur in addition to what is impacting the business today? Richard Galanti : In terms of the first piece of that question, yes, I don\u2019t know if it round to $0.01 or $0.03, but call it $0.02 is the guess. And it\u2019s a guess. At the time of transition, their money is baked into the deal, so I don\u2019t see any big impact to that hitting our numbers. Robert Drbul : And you mentioned the Alibaba Singles Day. Can you just give us any insight in how you\u2019re looking at China and essentially what you\u2019re learning so far from that relationship? Richard Galanti : We\u2019ve been asked about China for 20 years in about every two or three years, it used to Jeff and Jim and our head of international, Jim Murphy, and now of course it\u2019s Craig and Jeff and our international Jim Murphy and a few others in real estate. And we keep looking. At some point, we\u2019ll probably open a couple of units. But we haven\u2019t pulled that trigger yet to actually go forth. I would say it\u2019s probable in the next five years, but we got a lot going on. And for 20 years, we\u2019ve never been terribly concerned about we got to get there now. So this gets our name down a little bit, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve strategically sat down and said, hey, let\u2019s get our name down for a few years and then go. The Alibaba team all thing happened because they came to us and we did depreciate how many Kirkland Signature items were selling on their site before we sold them directly and at a better value. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Binder with Jefferies. Daniel Binder : You mentioned earlier in the call there was some of these one-time items that we were aware of, some that we were not. Just in terms of things like legal and regulatory, is there anything that we should anticipate in Q2 based on what you know today that we should be factoring in? Richard Galanti : No. Daniel Binder : You mentioned a little contribution from international which contributed to the tax rate difference. I was just curious, is that related to start up costs in areas like Spain, just higher losses associated with that or is it something... Richard Galanti : Not at all. What I was talking about is if you have $100 in Canada earned and year over year in the quarter the Canadian dollar relative to US dollar is down 15%, we bring it down at $85 of income, not $100 of income. And Canada being marginal tax rate, federal tax rate I believe is 26% currently versus actually off a little bit versus 39% in the US. In some other countries, it\u2019s actually a little lower or higher, but generally speaking, I believe the US versus in the nine countries you are, our affected US tax rate \u2013 our earnings in the US is quite a bit higher than anywhere else. So it\u2019s the penetration of foreign earnings to total earnings, it\u2019s that simple. Daniel Binder : So we had an opportunity to visit your Getafe club in Spain. It was pretty impressive. I think one of the areas that was surprising was the amount of local sourcing you\u2019re doing especially in areas like fresh and we heard about some of the export activities with local vendors. I was just curious if you could expand a little bit on what that opportunity looks like when you \u2013 not just for Spain, but other countries you\u2019re operating in. How much you\u2019re doing in terms of cross-border type sourcing for other clubs and whether it\u2019s the US or Japan, et cetera, it seemed like it was growing. Richard Galanti : First and foremost, the big thing is multinational vendors getting the \u2013 a lot of times, even with multinational vendors you\u2019ve got two or three or four geographic world regions. And I remember when we went into Australia and now we have eight units instead of one or two or three a few years ago, still with only eight, there is divisions of multinationals that aren\u2019t prepared quite to sell us, make available certain things and certainly sell us at global pricing. That can only change when they get us involved and again since we have that meeting here every four weeks, the budget meeting, that\u2019s when that happens. So I think a focus on that has helped us. As it relates to going into these markets, to the extent there are items in those countries that helps us both ways and I think that\u2019s, if you will, I think we do a good job of that. Those are all small little things that help long term. I\u2019ll give you an example back in Japan a few years ago, I forget the name of the \u2013 there\u2019s a very well known what\u2019s considered a very premium tea that\u2019s a Japanese branded product, that they initially were reluctant to sell us when we entered Japan, even as we had ten or so units. Once we worked with them to provide a cobranded Kirkland Signature by that brand name, not only in Japan but it sells very well in Eastern Canada and long the West Coast and California, all those things are net positives and not only afforded us an ability to have a premium item with a decent margin and a new item in these other markets where we\u2019re strong, that market potential allowed us I think to procure items faster in some of those countries. So it\u2019s a win-win. But these are small, again that is a small example. Richard Galanti : Thank you very much. We\u2019re around today if you have any further questions. Have a good day.",

Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker) Operator : Good morning. My name is Brittney and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 Earnings Call and February Sales Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. Thank you. Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO, you may begin your conference. Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Brittney. Good morning to everyone. I'll start by stating that our discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. That these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. So last night's press release reported our second quarter and first half fiscal 2016 operating results for the 12 and 24 week periods ended February 14 as well as our monthly sales results for four week reporting month of February which ended this past Sunday, February 28. For the quarter, reported earnings came in at $1.24 a share compared to last year's second quarter earnings per share of $1.35. Note that last year's earnings were positively impacted by two discreet income tax items that together benefited last year's second quarter earnings by $43 million or $0.10 a share, and that, excluding these two items, earnings for the second quarter last year would have been $1.25 a share. Among the factors that impacted our second quarter year-over-year earnings comparison, foreign exchange FX as compared to a year ago. During the quarter the foreign currencies where we operate continue to weaken versus the U.S. dollar in all countries but primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea, resulting in our foreign earnings in the second quarter when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $32 million or $0.07 a share and if exchange rates had been flat year-over-year. Second item of comparison is our co-branded credit card transition in the U.S. that relates to that. As you know we're transitioning to a new co-branded credit card relationship in the U.S. this year as we wind down our current relationship. New co-branded credit card's signup stopped several months ago. The short-term negative earnings impact to the loss co-branded credit card signups was $18 million pre-tax or a $0.03 per share hit to the second quarter. Recall that the earnings impact was $15 million pre-tax or $0.02 a share last fiscal quarter, and it will continue to impact earnings in Q3 and a little even into the first month of Q4. As of today, we expect to have the new co-branded Visa cards in the hands of our members in May with a go-live transition date in June. While I can't give you any specifics regarding the new card, contractually I can't do that yet. I do look forward to sharing more details with you at that time. Third item, IT modernization. Our major IT modernization efforts continue to impact SG&A expense percentages especially as depreciation begins on the new systems that are now being placed into service. In the second quarter on an incremental year-over-year basis these costs impacted SG&A by about $10 million or an estimated 3 basis points \u2013 2 basis points without the gas deflation, which was about $ 0.01 a share. There is a light at the end of this tunnel with the SG&A headwinds. Based on our current estimates we expect the year-over-year basis point impact to SG&A is likely to be just a couple of additional basis points in fiscal year 2017, and then flatten out, hopefully a little better than flattening out over the next couple of years after that. Stock compensation expense was higher year-over-year, second quarter by $14 million or $0.02 a share. And lastly in terms of the year-over-year comparison LIFO. Last year in the second quarter we recorded a pre-tax LIFO credit of $4 million. This year in the second quarter, with deflation being a little more impactful than in the past couple months, we had a LIFO pre-tax credit of $15 million resulting in a year-over-year delta of $11 million or $0.02 a share. Now turning to our second quarter sales. Reported sales were up 3% and our 12 week reported comp sales figure was up 1%. For the quarter, sales negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation to the tune of 80 basis points. And by weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar by minus 340 basis points. Such that excluding gas deflation, the reported plus 3% U.S. comp for the second quarter would have been a plus 4%. The reported Canadian comp of a minus 7% in the second quarter would be a plus 10%, excluding both gas deflation and assuming flat FX rates year-over-year. And the report minus 3% international comp figure for the quarter, excluding gas and FX, would have been a plus 6%. Total comps again reported 1% for the quarter, and excluding gas and FX would have been up 5. For the four-week month of February, which again ended this past Sunday, reported comps came in flat at 0%. That consisted of a plus 2% comp on a reported basis in the U.S., minus 2% reported in Canada and a minus 8% other international. As we discussed last month, the calendar shift of Super Bowl moved sales out of January reporting period into February. We estimated that this shift benefited our U.S. sales for the month of February by about 0.75% and the total company by about 0.5%. Sales were negatively impacted by again gas deflation which started to head down again during the month. About 180 basis point negative impact to the number and also by weakening FX currency \u2013 foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar to the tune of 250 basis points. Excluding gas deflation in the U.S., the reported plus 2% U.S. comp for February would have been a plus 4%. Excluding gas deflation and FX, in February minus 2% comp in Canada would have been a plus 10%. And the reported minus 8% international comp would have been flat year-over-year ex gas and FX. Total company comps reported, again zero for the month would have been a plus 4% excluding gas and FX. I might mention that the other international normalized number in other words ex gas and FX was zero. Mostly related to the time of the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays. We don't think that will be an issue after the timing of that. Final comment on deflation. Beyond gasoline price deflation that we've always pointed out each month, we have seen a little additional deflation across many merchandise categories such that sales have been impacted a bit by \u2013 a little bit more in the past couple of months. In terms of new openings. Our opening activities and plans, we opened 13 new units in Q1. Including two relos, so a net of 11 new locations in the first quarter. In Q2 we opened one new business center in Westminster, California. For all of fiscal 2016 we're still on a target to do 30 net new locations, 21 of which will be in the U.S., three in Canada, two in Japan, and one each in the U.K., Taiwan, Australia and Spain. Also this morning I'll review with you our e-commerce activities, membership trends and renewal information, additional discussion, of course, on margins and SG&A, and a couple of other items of note. Okay. In terms of the second quarter results, sales for the quarter were $27.57 billion up 3% from last year. On a reported comp basis, Q2 comps were up 1% for the quarter, up 5% ex gas and FX. For the quarter, our plus 1% reported comp was a combination of an average transaction decrease of minus 2.5% and an average shopping frequency increase of just over 3%. Now in terms of the minus 2.5% average transaction decrease, again, taking FX and gas out of that number, that minus 2.5% would have been a positive number that would be just under plus 2%. In terms of sales comparisons geographically, in the U.S., the Midwest, Texas and California regions were strongest. Internationally in Q2 in local currencies better performing countries were Mexico, Canada, Australia and Taiwan. In terms of merchandising categories for the quarter \u2013 for the second quarter within food and sundries, overall flattish. Meat, deli and sundries were the leaders. Tobacco, negative in low-double digits as we continue to eliminate tobacco SKUs from various locations. For hardlines, overall in the mid-single digit range. Departments with the strongest results were consumer electronics which was up in the low- to mid-teens, sporting goods, lawn and garden and tires. Within the low- to mid-single digit softlines, domestics and apparel were the standouts. And in fresh foods, comp sales were in the low-single digit range with produce showing the best results among the four main fresh foods categories. Lastly, as we mentioned during the December and January sales calls, in the U.S., we're seeing deflation in the low-single digit range for foods, sundries and fresh foods, and now, again, a little bit more on the non-food side as well. In terms of February, traffic was up a little over 3.5%, while the average transaction was down a little under 4%; about 3.75%. Again, gas, as I mentioned earlier, fell again a little more dramatically in February. The average sale price year-over-year in gas was down 21% for the month, which is a bigger decline year-over-year than we saw in the quarter overall. In terms of geographic regions, again, for February, Texas, Southeast and the Midwest regions were strongest. And internationally in local currencies, Mexico and Canada were at the top. From a merchandise category standpoint ex-FX, all categories, food, sundries, hardlines, softlines, fresh foods were in the mid-single digit range for February reporting period. Again, a little deflation impacting these. And it's a little deflation, but it's more than we have seen historically of recent history. Moving down the line items of the income statement, membership fees, we came in for this fiscal year at $603 million, up 4% or $21 million from $582 million a year ago and up 2 basis points as a percent of sales. Again, that $21 million increase and 4% dollar increase, if you assumed flat FX, the $21 million would have been a $40 million increase, and the 4% increase ex FX would have been a 7% increase. And in terms of membership, renewal rates remain strong; 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% rounded up in worldwide. Continuing increasing penetration in the Executive Member I think helps that. New membership sign ups in Q2 company-wide were up 4%. I will point out last month, the early part of February and into the second week of February, for 12 days we ran a new membership promotion on LivingSocial. Recall that we also ran a membership promotion with LivingSocial about 18 months ago. Like that one, it went well and we don't do it too often, and we don't want to get people used to it, but it was a good result. In terms of new members at Q2 end, Gold Star members at Q2 end was 35.4 million up from 34.7 million at Q1 end 12 weeks earlier. Business primary remained at 7.2 million. Business add-ons remained at 3.5 million. So all total, at Q2 end, we were at 46.1 million versus 45.4 million at Q1 end. And total cardholders would be 84.0 million, up from 82.7 million. As of the end of the second quarter, paid Executive Memberships totaled 16.6 million of our members, an increase of 214,000 over the 12-week month, or 18,000 a week increase in the quarter. As I've mentioned before, Executive Members are a little more than a third of membership base and two-thirds of our sales results. In terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned, they continue to be strong. Business in U.S. and Canada was at 94.5%, the same as it was a quarter ago. Gold Star was 89.7%, the same as a quarter ago. Total U.S. and Canada, 90.5%, same as a quarter ago. Worldwide at 87.7%, down a tick from 87.8% at Q1 end. And a little bit of rounding, and then as you know. In all new markets we generally have in the first year lower renewal rates, and that second year and the first year of renewals. I've mentioned in the last couple months that in Canada when we did the credit card conversion, which is a little different than the one we're doing here, it was what was referred to as a de novo thing where everybody had to sign up for a new credit card and apply, and what have you. And so your renewal rates related to auto renewals, which by definition are high, it comes down a little. That will be anniversaried after next quarter. So, we saw a little tick down in Canada this quarter year-over-year as we had in the last couple quarters as well. There should be one more quarter of that, again, not terribly meaningful but we've been asked. Going down the gross margin line, our gross margin in the second quarter was higher year-over-year on reported basis by 17 basis points. As always, we'll jot down four columns of numbers with six line items. The first two columns are Q1 2016 and Q1 2016. The columns would be reported, column one. Column two would be without gas deflation. Then we'd have Q2 2016, two columns reported and without gas deflation. Reading across, core merchandise in Q1 on a reported basis was up 24 basis points. Ex gas deflation was down 3 basis points year-over-year. For Q2 2016, reported was plus 5 basis points, and without deflation minus 3 basis points. Ancillary, plus 11 basis points and plus 4 basis points in the first quarter year-over-year. Plus 9 basis points and plus 7 basis points in Q2. 2% Reward, minus 3 basis points and minus 1 basis point. Q2, minus 1 basis points and zero. LIFO, plus 1 basis point and plus 1 basis point. And in Q2, plus 4 basis points and plus 4 basis points. Other was minus seven and minus seven a year ago. And not an issue, zero and zero in Q2. Such that total reported year-over-year in Q1, we were up 26 basis points in gross margin. Without gas deflation, down 6 basis points. And in Q2 we were up 17 basis points and up 8 basis points ex gas deflation. As you can see the core component of gross margin was higher by 5 basis points. 3 basis points excluding gas deflation in the quarter. Core gross margins, food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods as a percentage of their own sales were positive year-over-year in Q1 by 11 basis points, with food, sundries and hardlines showing higher year-over-year gross margins as a percent of their own sales. While softlines and fresh foods are a little lower year-over-year as a percent of sales. But again, the net of those four major categories as a percent of their own sales was up year-over-year in the quarter by 11 basis points. Ancillary and other business gross margins were up 9 basis points, 7 basis points without gas. Both \u2013 in terms of ancillary businesses, our gas business, our food courts, our hearing aid centers, our tire shops and our mini labs all showed higher gross margins year-over-year as a percentage of their own sales. Again, Executive Membership not an issue without deflation, a zero impact year-over-year. And again, LIFO, a 4 basis point benefit to the gross margin year-over-year. Moving to reported SG&A. Our SG&A percentage in Q2 was higher or worse year-over-year by 34 basis points on a reported basis and higher or up by 27 basis points ex deflation. Let me again give you these tabular numbers and then I'll give you some text around those. Again, the four columns would be report Q1. The first two columns would be Q1 2016 year-over-year reported and without gas and deflation, and Q2 reported without gas. Those would be the four columns. First line item, operations would be zero basis points in Q1 reported and plus 26 basis points without gas deflation, the plus meaning lower or better. In Q2 minus 22 basis points and minus 16 basis points. Central minus 8 basis points and minus 6 basis points in Q1. In Q2 minus 8 basis points and minus 7 basis points. Stock expense minus 12 basis points and minus 10 basis points in Q1. In Q2, minus 4 basis points and minus 4 basis points. And quarterly adjustments or unusual items, minus 8 basis points and minus 8 basis points in Q1. And no unusual items to point out, zero and zero in Q2. Such that in Q1 year-over-year on a reported basis, SG&A was a minus 28 basis points or higher by 28 basis points. And Q1 ex-gas it was better or lower by 2 basis points, so a plus 2 basis points. In Q2 it was minus 34 basis points as I mentioned and minus 27 basis points ex-gas deflation, so higher by 27 basis points. Now core operations, again component, the minus 22 basis points. Again, minus 16 ex-gas, ex the impact of gas deflation. Of that minus 16 basis points, payroll was about minus 2 basis points. Benefits and workers comp were minus 8 basis points, with the remaining minus 6 basis points being a variety of items including bank fees, depreciation, and various other items. Again, I think a few of those things relate to a very slight change in sales increases. And a couple things just going 1 basis point in the wrong direction. I'll also point out that within the benefits and workers comp, about \u2013 one thing that stood out, is just in January we had what was referred to as high cost claims for employee benefits, medical claims. Typically it averages over the last two years \u2013 this is U.S. \u2013 about $6 million or $7 million. A year ago it was a little lower than that, it was about $3.5 million. This year, it was about $13 million. So nothing unusual other than what we refer to as high cost claims, anything over $100,000 but it just spiked and that's a few basis points there. But again, that will come and go in both directions. In terms of central expense, higher year-over-year in Q2 by 8 basis points, 7 basis points without gas. As I mentioned earlier, IT was 3 basis points of that or 2 basis points without gas deflation. In addition we had several one-time items which in total represented about $9 million. Again, we always have a few one-time things that go either way. We had three items that together totaled $9 million. But they are what they are and it didn't impact our SG&A. And lastly, the stock compensation expense was 4 basis points. Now before I move on from SG&A, I do want to mention one additional expense headwind that is just starting. In March every three years, we review our pay scales and in fact our entire employee agreement. We always review top of scale and historically increase the top of scale every year in March where the roughly 60%, 65% of our employees that are at top of scale already. In addition, this year we're also changing the starting level or entry level hourly wages. This is the first change to the entry level wages in nine years. Since 2007 our entry level wage in U.S. and Canada was $11.50 or $12 an hour. Effective this month in the U.S. and Canada, we're increasing our starting wages from $11.50 and $12 to $13 and $13.50. So up a dollar and a half. We estimate that this will cost us about $ 0.01 a share in Q3 year-over-year, and about $0.02 a share in each of the next three fiscal quarters. Again, it's part of what we do and as \u2013 there are a few warehouses that we've already started people at a higher level. Simply markets like Bay Area or some limited markets like that. At the end of the day it will be about the numbers that I mentioned in terms of the impact to our earnings. Next on the income statement is pre-opening expense. Pretty much the same year-over-year. $9 million last year and $10 million this year. Last year we had no actual openings in the quarter but a lot of that relates to openings that are just getting ready to occur or just occurred, as well as one opening this year. All told, operating income in Q2 came in at $856 million, down 2% from a year ago's $877 million. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense in Q2 came in at $31 million. That's up $4 million from last year's $27 million. The increase is primarily due to interest on the $1 billion debt offering that was completed in Q3 last year related to our one-time special dividend that we did back in February a year ago. Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $4 million, coming in at $20 million last year and only $16 million this year. Actual interest income for the quarter was lower year-over-year by about $8 million, primarily a factor of less cash on hand this year as compared to a year earlier. This is a result again of two things. We had a $1.2 billion debt payoff last December as well as we used about $1 billion of our cash towards paying that $5 a share special dividend last February 27, a year ago. Overall pre-tax income was lower by 3% or $29 million in Q2, going from $870 million a year ago to $841 million. In terms of income taxes, we got a little help there. Our company income tax rate this quarter came in right at 34%, up from a little over 30% a year ago in the quarter. The income tax line on this year's Q2 benefited from a few positive discrete items resulting in the 34% rate. Our normalized rate would have been a shade over 35%. While last year's income tax line benefited from, as I mentioned \u2013 we mentioned earlier, a $43 million benefit primarily relating to our $5 special cash dividend. Overall reported net income of $598 million last year in Q2 compares to $546 million of net income this year in Q2 on a reported basis. All right. Run down of a few other items. A balance sheet is included in this morning's press release. A couple of things I always point out on this call. Depreciation and amortization for Q2 totaled $285 million for the quarter, and $556 million year-to-date. Our AP ratio, accounts payable as a percent of payables, last year in Q2 on a reported basis it was 97%, and this year 5 percentage points lower at 92%. That includes construction and other payables. So if you just looked at merchandise payables as a percent of inventories it would be 87% a year ago, and 4% lower or at 83% this year. Last year being higher by 4% or 5% a year is actually the anomaly. A couple of factors, part of it was last year's West Coast port slowdowns. You had a lot less inventory a year ago on some big ticket low turn items like electronics. Just that one department was $120 million-plus of higher inventory and only a few million dollars of higher accounts payable. And then gas payables again was $20 million or $30 million to the wrong side of this AP calculation as we try to keep our tanks a little full, more full, when prices decline. So again, that's running the business, and nothing per se exceptional there. In terms of average inventory per warehouse. Pretty much flat year-over-year coming in just $6,000 higher this year, an average inventory per warehouse of $12.761 million up from $12.755 million a year ago. Ex-FX year-over-year inventory levels per warehouse were up more than the $6,000, they were up $286,000 or up 2%. But that again, on a normalized basis I think is one of the smaller increases we've seen year-over-year in that. Overall, inventory is in good shape. Not only in good shape, we just completed mid-year or our mid-year physical inventories and it's our best shrink results ever by 1 basis point plus. So again, I think it's indicative of running a clean shop there. In terms of CapEx, in Q1 we spent $715 million, in Q2 we spent approximately $650 million more. We were still on track this year for fiscal 2016 CapEx to be in the range of $2.8 billion-plus. Maybe as high as $3 billion but $2.8 billion to $3 billion, that compares to $2.4 billion CapEx in fiscal 2015. Next, Costco e-commerce, Costco online. We're now in six countries, having recently opened in Korea and Taiwan. We're also of course in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico. For Q2, sales and profits were up over last year. Our total sales were up 19% in the quarter, up 22% ex-FX and on a comp basis, up 18% reported and up 21% ex-FX. So continued good results in terms of growing our e-commerce efforts. In terms of expansion, fiscal 2016 again we opened ahead of 11 units in Q1. One new unit in Q2. So 12 through midyear. We plan seven net openings in Q3, nine openings including two relos. So seven net. And in Q4 we are on task to do 11. So that would give us the 30 total for the fiscal year. If you go back a year ago in fiscal 2015 we added 23 net new units on a base of what was then \u2013 beginning basis 653. So about 3.5% square footage growth. This year assuming we get to the 30, that will be about 4.5% square footage growth. Again the new locations by country if we do the 30, 21 in U.S., three in Canada, one in the U.K. and three into Asia. One in Taiwan and two in Japan. One more in Australia and one more in Spain. At Q2 end, total square footage stood at 100.7 million square feet. Next in terms of stock buybacks in Q1 as I mentioned a quarter ago, we spent about $130 million buying 898,000 shares back, so an average price of just under $145 a share. In Q2 we spent $80 million on 531,000 shares, so an average price at just over $150 a share. During the first five weeks of the past quarter, very little stock was repurchased. In fact, of the total $80 million, $3 million of the $80 million was purchased in the first five weeks, and the remainder, the vast majority was in the last seven weeks. And that's purely a function of how we do it. We look at kind of a matrix pricing. As it goes up a little, we buy a little less, when it comes down a little, we buy a little more. As long as we feel comfortable about our runway, I think we'll continue do that. In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.40 a share, so $1.60 annualized, which on an annual basis is about a $700 million number. That's the quick and dirty of how Q2 went. I'll turn it back to Brittney now and be happy to answer any questions. Brittney? Operator : Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hey, Richard, I know you have this data; I don't know if you, how deeply you dig into it, but if you look at traffic in the U.S. by your different customer segments, and particularly your most loyal customers, right, so are the most loyal customers generally fresh food customers? Is that a good part of the basket? And do you think \u2013 is it possible that a little bit of the moderation in traffic is are you maxing out with your truly best customers? It's just kind of hard to grow frequency with that group? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, I'd have to look into it. I don't know. My guess would be that our more frequent customers are bimodal. They're the ones that you mentioned that would \u2013 are shopping for frequency as families on a regular basis, and certainly food is a meaningful part of that. That's in my view, one of the two or three main factors that get people in the door on a more frequent basis. We also have small business members who are buying a lot of things, not necessarily fresh foods, but obviously some restaurants and community stores will buy some of that. But in terms of maxing out, I've said it before, I continue to be surprised how many more Executive Members we're getting even up on the existing longer-tenured members. And so we \u2013 look, we've got to keep doing what we're doing in terms of being good merchants and constantly improving the value. And there's always saturation in everything you do. We're pretty good at figuring out ways to offset that. In the last year or two, certainly organics has helped. Not only bringing in arguably some newer perhaps younger members, but taking existing members who love Costco but there are certain things they didn't buy at Costco because they're an organic family. So I think we'll keep coming up with stuff. But I don't \u2013 I would bet that logically that makes a little sense, but I bet you it's not that big of a factor, that concern. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Do you think the \u2013 are your best customers, do you think they're shopping three, four times a month or more frequently than that? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : I'm sorry, who? John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Your best customers, right, in terms of shopping frequency. Do you think they're up to three, four times a month or even more? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I'd say three or four times a month. I think you \u2013 look, you have some customers shopping twice a week. A core of are small business. I have a friend that shops six times a week. That's what he tells me, and I run into him a lot, and I scratch my head why. So, but no, jokes aside, arguably when there's a family that's getting to shop four times a week, are they on that curve of incremental frequency increases that would be \u2013 it's going to be harder and harder to do. But again, we're pretty good at figuring out a reason why they need to come back. And... John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC : All right. Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : And we're getting more \u2013 we feel good about the fact that in the last couple years, our average members' age which a half a dozen years ago was about a four-year \u2013 they were four years older than the U.S. population, that's now just under two. So it's going \u2013 that's going in the right direction for a lot of reasons. The fact that we keep adding some gas stations is driving frequency. I remember years ago, I've heard for 30 years, now that this thing is maxing out, fresh foods or gas stations, whatever it is, we keep figuring out new things. And I feel good about some of the things we're doing in a lot of the non-foods categories. Fresh foods never ceases to amaze me, and we'll keep going. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC : All right. And then just lastly, you talked about two of the categories were up in gross, two were down. So just maybe a little more color on the ones up versus down? How much \u2013 mix a factor. I guess I thought fresh food might, just because of deflation and a little bit of delayed pass through. I guess maybe you pass through that a little more quickly? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, we do that \u2013 by the way, one thing that Bob here reminded me of. Another issue in terms of a year-over-year comparison, or as some of you like to talk to the two-year stack. It was a year ago when gas fell dramatically in a big way and we had a couple of months there, we had a 5.5% frequency for a couple of months. So, I think some of it's the deflation that we're seeing now a little bit, but some of it's that year-over-year comparison when we had some pretty nice numbers there. Now I'm hopeful that we'll find out in the next couple months once we \u2013 not that we've anniversaried that. John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Joshua M. Siber - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. This is Joshua Siber on for Simeon. If gas prices stay low, do you expect to see traffic slow as that competitive advantage starts to diminish? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Again, in theory, it should be less of a factor helping sales because we're not on the news every night. We love it every year when GasBuddy comes out. Now, three or four years in a row since they started it they we're the lowest price nationally on average. I think we still get positive feedback from that. So yes, I mean at the end of the day, is it better when we had \u2013 is it better than when we had, gas was going down a buck year-over-year or over a couple months and it's on the news every night. Sure, that helps us a little more. But we still find people that are just signing up and can't believe our gas prices. Again, it's a net positive. It's less of a positive than it was in the first year, the second year and the third year. Joshua M. Siber - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And a follow up to John's question. I don't know if you have this in front of you, but would you be able to compare traffic and ticket growth across demographic groups? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : I don't have \u2013 I know that our membership and marketing people looked at that and I've seen it, but I don't know if want to go that \u2013 I don't have it in front of me so I can't answer that question. Joshua M. Siber - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Last one for me, then. If you could talk about the dynamics between the credit card transition and a potential membership price increase in terms of timing? Well, there's no real dynamic. It looks like we're on task, as you know. Just last week, I believe, American Express and Citi announced the agreement to purchase the portfolio. And in which I believe we're on track to issue \u2013 Citi's on track to issue cards to the existing millions of members that have the current co-branded card in May with a transition date likely in early June. But, again, that could slow up a week or two, too, we'll see. And in terms of transition, there's not a lot contractually that we can do until then. And, of course, when the cardholders are being sent those cards by Citi, they'll be getting information from Citi. And I think that will start that process of making our members aware of what the new card brings to them and then we'll go from there. Look, we're excited about getting it done. It is a big transition in a sense that there's millions of members that have the current card and they'll get the new card in the mail. We're excited about the value proposition to our members and we think it will be a net positive long term. Like anything, when we can save money, we want to give most of it to our members, and this will be like that, as well. We'll get a little benefit from it. As it relates to the fee increase, we really haven't made any decisions which would be consistent with the six times we did it in the past. History has shown that if you just dot it out chronologically, it's about e five to six years. The last time we did it was in January of 2012. So five years would be January of 2017 and six years would be a year later. I can only tell you that, logic would dictate we certainly wouldn't do anything during the transition. We've got enough going on this year, mid-year when we're doing this credit card transition. And so all those align to a possible answer. At the end of the day, I don't know when we'll do it. I can tell you that we feel as comfortable today as ever about the loyalty of our members and we feel as comfortable as ever today that we feel that we've improved the value on that membership way more than the likely increases that you've seen in the past. So stay tuned. Joshua M. Siber - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, Richard. Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yep. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. So I want to follow up on the potential membership fee increases. While last time you raised the Executive Membership price in addition to Gold Star, but I believe \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong. That was the first time you had ever done it. So can you walk us through how you thought about that last time? And maybe reflect on how \u2013 what that could possibly mean for the next potential increase? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, I think the bigger issue is for about I think it's 10 or 12 or so years we had the Executive Membership out there. The Executive Membership from its inception was $100. And our view at the time was let's build it. And in theory every time \u2013 if you think about it when we originally did the Exec, I think the Gold Star was $45. And so there was a $55 delta if you will. And $55 assuming a 2% reward break-even if you will between do I stay a regular member, become an executive was $27. An incremental $2,750 of annual purchases. And as the $45 went to $50 and to $55 that delta became less, so in theory another bucket of \u2013 I think it was 2 million-plus million additional members that fell into that bucket of being above break-even than below break-even. And so we wanted to grow it. As we decided to raise it almost five years ago, four-plus years ago, not only from $50 to $55 but the $100 to $110, I think felt that we've gotten a lot of that benefit. And certainly there's a lot more benefit incrementally than $10 and so we felt comfortable doing that. That's how we got there. How we get to next one, stay tuned. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. And then just reflecting back on the traffic I think, ex the Super Bowl, still three plus traffic comp. Do you think that much has changed in terms of the behavior of the consumer within the box in terms of maybe are you seeing it in different mix, buying less discretionary items, less sort of trade up within the category or any commentary there that you can talk about the consumer and how they're behaving in the store. Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, in terms of discretionary, some of our stronger categories are not foods. And so that flies in the face of that concern. Did we see a little bit of \u2013 a little less strong numbers in some of those higher ticket categories in parts of Texas or Canada or \u2013 well, Canada was strong notwithstanding that. Or I guess North Dakota (41:04) I don't know about North Dakota. I know Texas it was a little different even though Texas overall was fine. I know that when I talked to our head of International, because of the strong dollar they saw a little bit of \u2013 a little weakening of that strength in the bigger ticket discretionary items. But overall we've had our best percentage dollar increases in electronics and statistically in TVs the last couple of months in a few years. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, thank you. My question was around membership as well. You obviously have a good retention rate and then presumably in existing clubs you have members that sign up to help fill the gap. I'm just curious if you can give us some metrics around comp membership growth, how that looks in the U.S. and then how that looks on international? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, first of all, any new market even when we went into New Orleans where we had been in Louisiana before a couple years ago. You're going to see a year hence when you have your first class of renewals, it's going be a number quite a bit lower than our company average. I think in the U.S. we typically see numbers in that first full year in a new market \u2013 and there aren't that many new markets anymore, but when we do, something in the low 70%s, perhaps. Overseas when we first opened in Korea, Taiwan and Japan and as we've opened new units in new geographic markets in those countries, we might see in the first year our renewal rates in the high 50%s low 60%s and it grows from there. So our renewal rates \u2013 and that's why you see that we separate U.S. and Canada which is the most mature. That number is a little higher than the worldwide number for that very reason. We always see a higher renewal rate among the Executive Members. They get it. They're spending \u2013 they're investing another $55 on top of the main $55 on that upgrade because they get it and they get the value of it. And we think that works, reward programs works. Co-branded credit card rewards works. Fresh food and gas works, all those things help. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : So, looking in aggregate, mature clubs and new markets, is the Company actually experiencing a comp store membership growth? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yes. I'm sorry. And most of our sign-ups are comp sign-ups, so the answer is yes. I mean this is a rounded number here. But when asked, hey, if you have a 90% or 91%, well we'll use 90% for this example. If you have a 90% renewal rate and you had 100 members, what do you have a year hence? Well you have about 101 or 102. You lose 10 and you gain 11 or 12. That's kind of how it's been. And that's, and I'm shooting from the hip with this one, but that's pretty consistent with my assumption of if overall new member sign-ups are in the 4% range this past quarter. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : And you mentioned the Living Social campaign was good. Can you give us a little color around how many and how many were millennials? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : No. Millennials were \u2013 well, not in terms of the number. We were pleased with our results based on our expectations of it. But, again, we don't want to get people comfortable waiting for that kind of value proposition to sign up. And so that's why we waited 18 months. And as it relates to millennials, I know I don't have the chart in front of me, but I know the chart that our head of membership marketing shared at the budget meeting. Yes, it over-indexes the other way towards younger people relative to our existing base, which is what you'd expect. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : And then my last question for you on the LIFO credit based on what you know today about deflation storewide, are you expecting additional LIFO credits as we get into the back half of the year? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : If it were today, I'd say yes. But you never know. Keep in mind when we have a LIFO credit, your markup is probably impacted a little the other way. When you have a LIFO charge, it's because there's inflation. You've raised your prices a little bit. Sometimes there's a little bit of a gap there. So it's part of margin. But yes, I think all things we see today, it would be a LIFO credit, a little bit of that extra LIFO credit. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. On the wage increases, is the increase that you are giving this year consistent with what you've done in the past? And when you've done this in the past, have you noticed any change in your sales trajectory? So employee satisfaction goes up and that leads to a better membership experience or it coincides with broader wage inflation and some people have more money to spend and they spend it at the warehouses? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, well, somebody once said it's like chicken soup, it can't hurt. I think at the end of the day, at top of the scale we've done every year for as long as I can remember. When you've got somebody that's reached top of scale, they want to know what they're going to get a year hence. And we've always erred to the high side on that. I think over the last three years, top of scale in the U.S. is in the $23 range, $22.50 or something just top of scale. And so if you \u2013 and I think it was a $0.50 or $0.60 increase, so let's say $0.55 on $23.00 would be about 2.5%, a little under 2.5% increase. I believe the current increases are similar to that kind of percentage. What we haven't done every year is bottom of scale. We like to be \u2013 and by the way, I want to also say is that the amount of cumulative hours it takes for somebody to get from bottom of scale to top of scale on a full- time basis, not that people will always start at full-time, they don't. But on a full-time basis it takes about four-and-a-half years which is very, very short period of time. So our employees get it. But we think this will help, and it's important to do. We want to be the premium at all levels. We're a huge premium at the top of scale. That's as others raise their rates at the bottom. And frankly in some markets, this is a physically challenging job. You're on your feet, you're lifting cases, you're pushing carts at these entry level jobs. And so we thought it was time to do it. So that is incremental. And that's when I mentioned earlier on the call that the $0.01 a share in Q3, thank you. And the $0.02 a share in each of the next three quarters because there are four quarters, that's that incremental piece that I'm talking about. Now I would like to think that we're not going to have less shrink or employee shrink because of it, or they're going to be better service providers to our members. I think it reinforces what they already feel. And that's what we're all about. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : And then my second question is on the competitive landscape. Traffickers remain good on a multiyear basis, but a little bit more volatile just on a one-year basis. Are you seeing any signs that you are having more interference from competition? It certainly doesn't look like it from some of your club peers, but maybe some of your online players are peeling off, some members, or peeling off some trips from your member base. Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : I don't think so. I mean again, on the margin, are there a few? I'm sure there's somebody that made one less trip to Costco because they bought something online or somewhere else. But I think we're still doing a pretty good job of getting them in the door particularly with fresh foods, with gas for the Executive Member with a quality co-brand offer in terms of rewards. So all those things help. I think we got, again \u2013 look, online is taking a piece. And some of those pieces, we're not going take. We're not going take the single unit items, some small-value food and sundry things that are going to be delivered to your door by 7 in the morning if you ordered six hours earlier. That's not us. We can't do that at 10% and 11% margins. We're taking little pieces of other things. Again, we still feel pretty good about what's going on. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Awesome. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to go back, and this may be a follow-up to some of the earlier questions. But if the U.S. comps ex-gas in January and February, so my numbers \u2013 you had a 1% and a 4%. And you had mentioned before there was some shift between those two months, just given weather and then more importantly, the timing of the Super Bowl. But I guess the question I have, Richard, if you look at those months and then maybe take them in total, is that tracking \u2013 are sales in the U.S. tracking where you'd expect them to be and if not, is there something we can point to explain why? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, look. Like a teenager, we always want more. I think when we look at the detail, deflation is probably the biggest factor. And that gives us comfort that fundamentally there's not been a lot of change in our view. We still, it bothers us that it tracked a little differently. Again, that just makes us look at everything, what else can we do? And we've got a lot of good things going on out there. So do we like it a little better? Sure. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And on the deflation point, you probably gave these numbers already, but was deflation a more significant factor here in the first two months of 2016 than it had been say in the second half or latter part of 2015? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Again, there's different ways to measure deflation. The answer's yes, first of all. But there's different ways to measure deflation. If I look at a first, just from a LIFO index which is U.S. inventories. If everything started at a cost \u2013 everything that we had in our warehouse had a cost of 100.00, that was the baseline, at the end of Q1, so in late November, that LIFO index was 99.49. So a 0.5% lower. On average, that's that inventory LIFO calculation. In the last eight weeks, the 99.5 has gone to 99.06, so down 44 more basis points. So yes, that continues. So that's where I got the \u2013 it's a little lower. We're seeing a little bit more deflation. And particularly we're seeing it in some of those non-food categories. When I look at the 85% plus of our goods that go through our depot operations, again, this is just one parameter. The number of pounds being shipped through with a dollar value, that dollar value is down a little over a 1% year-over-year. Now year-over-year, not from the beginning of this fiscal year. So again, that would indicate to me again we're seeing a little bit more deflation. I can give you crazy numbers on given items. On a year-over-year basis, when you look down, just candy. M&Ms down 10% year-over-year. American single slices of cheese down 15%. Bacon down 20%, so. But there's also some inflationary items. But, overall, I think the LIFO index and that depot calculation, although it's not a perfect calculation, would indicate that we're seeing a little bit more deflation than we had overall. And particularly on the nonfood side you're seeing it. I think I mentioned a quarter or two ago when asked about that, with oil prices coming down, what about some nonfood items like plastic bags and things that require a lot of petroleum based products. And the answer I got back, and I shared with everybody, was yes you're seeing it but you've got to ask for it more frequently and more strongly. And even then it took a little longer because sometimes you've got vendors that have committed out several months, if not a year, on raw material prices. And we're going work with them. We're going to do what we can, but we're not going to create hurt. And so again, we're starting to see a little bit of that. But that's retail. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. That is helpful. Then the second question I had just with respect to the forthcoming shift in credit card and I know it is early but is there anything you are watching as some type of leading indicator as to how your members may or may not react to this shift? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Look, you've got 11 million or so members that have the co-brand card. You've got however many, high 20 million of member households in the U.S. We've had our share of letters both ways. Good. I'm glad you're changing, I never liked whoever. And then you've got those that say how dare you change, I got it for this reason, and I love my card, my existing card. So aside from that, we feel comfortable or we wouldn't have done it. We recognize that \u2013 we are looking to spend afterwards. I think with the reward proposition, with the \u2013 any possible improvement in merchant fee to us, with the fact that the new card will be accepted more places. There's a lot of reasons why it should be a positive. We have to get there and see. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Richard. You spoke about the incremental labor costs that are forthcoming with the $0.01 hit in Q3 and $0.02 thereafter over the next 12 months. But can you just dig a little bit more into the expense deleverage from the second quarter? Certainly as you mentioned, there was a little bit lighter sales volume so perhaps that had an impact. But how should we think about the results in 2Q and the outlook on payroll and benefits and operations central, et cetera? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, I think, first of all, sales drive leverage. And I remember years ago, when we were always asked the question, what comp sales number do you need to get any leverage at all, or to be consistent? And our guesstimate at the time \u2013 this has been years ago, was something in the 4% or 5% range an underlying comp. But my stronger and more confident proportionate response was, whatever other companies do to be able to better leverage if sales showed a little weakness, we're not going be as good, because we're not going to do some things. We are going to still clean the bathrooms every hour, and we are still going to make sure all the carts are inside, and not sitting out there, and we are not going to cut labor. In fact, we'll enhance labor. We've done that at times at the front end to drive more business. So I think again the bottom of the scale increase that's easy, that's quantifiable. A few of the moves lined up on a few items, I mentioned the high cost claims was 3 basis points or 4 basis points. I mentioned there were three other items that usually two of them go one way, and one go the other way. And so it's a couple million, or a $0.0025 or $0.005 impact to the quarter. This time it was all in one direction. And so you're always going always going have that. But I guess I too get a little more defensive when we miss the number. Some of it was we could have done a little better job. And so directionally we're going to try to do a better job. We're going to hope the moons (57:30) line up two to one to the positive, not three to zero the other way. And we know that we're getting a little less hit from IT modernization a year or two in. Other than that, that's what we do for a living. I think the other thing is to drive more business, and we're pretty good at that. Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Fair enough. Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : By the way, then the credit card. You've heard it before, I've said it before. Whatever this additional bucket of potential money is, we're going to give most of it to the customer in the form of a co-brand offering. But we're going to keep a little of it, and that helps merchant fees. But that's not going to start until the summer, and we'll go from there. So that should help us a little. We've got our fingers crossed. Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I appreciate that color. Certainly we will take a look at the 10-Q when that is out to see some of the margin detail geographically. But could you maybe just give us a little bit of preview of any changes year-over-year from a U.S. or Canada or international standpoint? Maybe you can just speak to some of the performances ongoing in those particular markets? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : No, I think we'll have to wait until the quarter is out. The only thing that you've seen in the past historically is gas continues to be strong, but on a year-over-year basis, there's not a big difference. And gas is a big thing to the U.S. I think you've seen a couple of quarters in the 10-Q, in the last couple of \u2013 two or three quarters where the biggest improvement year-over-year on that, in the segment analysis of operating income as a percent of sales, you had \u2013 the most improved was the U.S. column, which is one of the lower columns. And that \u2013 and we've mentioned as part of that is attributed to gas. But I know in Q2, there was not a big, it was still good, but it was also still, it was very good a year ago. So other than that, I can't really talk to you about until it comes out. Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Lastly from me and very quickly on e-commerce, you continue to have very solid growth, up I think it was 19% this quarter, 22% ex-FX. Can you just speak to some of the categories really driving that strength? Is there any expansion of assortment that we've seen online of late? And just a quick update on the Google and Instacart partnerships? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, we have over the last couple of years expanded some of the categories in what we'll call velocity categories; some sundries items, some limited non-perishable food items, some apparel items, socks and underwear, just speaking of things like that; health and beauty aids. So yeah, that's a little of it, but those are small pieces relative to if you can drive sales in furniture and exercise equipment and electronics. So those things are helping us as well. I think it's a lot of the things we've done. Some out there would argue it's about time. But we're getting to it. And we're driving \u2013 we're starting to do a few new things. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, Richard. How's the growth in trips to the pump changed as gas prices have dropped here around $2? Has that been, have you seen a noticeable change there? And remind us what percentage of those fill-up trips correspond with a visit inside the club? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, for every 100 people that pump gas during the hours that we're open in the warehouse, because we open a couple hours earlier than the warehouse opens at the gas pump and close an hour later, it's in the low-50%s. And that's improved a little from 50% and 49%, but it's in the low-50%s. What was the other part of the question? I'm sorry. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I mean, have you seen the growth in trips moderate as gas prices have fallen? I think \u2013 whether you mentioned that by comp gallon growth or what have you. Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Well, what we see is when it really spiked a year and a quarter ago, we saw a spike there as well \u2013 well in terms of gallon-age comps. It's still positive and it still beats the U.S. averages out there, but it's more muted than when you have those big deltas. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's fair. That makes sense. And then just on the organic... Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : By the way, that means we're retaining it. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, no, understood. And then just on the organics, can you remind us where your penetration is at this point, what the pace of growth has been and where you think you can take that? Do you have more room to continue to improve the penetration of organics? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, we're about $4 billion, which was I think in the last two years, it was up 30%-ish. And we're on task, I think our goal this year to have a double-digit number that has a two in front of it, and we feel good about it. We are I think doing as good a job as anybody in terms of sourcing. And part of the challenge is availability. And the industry is growing, needless to say. There are more farmers and more poultry producers and more beef producers that are committing more to this. And we're certainly out there literally in the fields here and abroad getting these growers and processors to do more. So, I think it still has some good opportunities there. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then last question just on D&A was up about 9% year-over-year in the quarter. Is that a pace that you are comfortable with kind of going forward? Is that going to accelerate at all as some of these investments come in or I'm just trying to get a sense for how we should be thinking about the growth in D&A going forward? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : It's partly going up because of IT modernization and because we're opening 30 units instead of 23. And, although this 30, 21 or so are in the U.S. which is a little different than I would have guessed two years ago what it would be by now. So I would say that it will \u2013 for a couple years here it has kicked up. We got at least one more year where it will kick up because of IT modernization, this year or next. And then it probably kicks up a little bit because of just a little bit more expansion and a little bit more expensive expansion. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : So does that the number, if D&A \u2013 if sales are growing X, does D&A grow at X plus two or three? I'd have to look at it, but it's probably as good a guess as anybody. I look at what it's done historically and probably it grows a little faster than that the next couple years \u2013 couple or three years percentage-wise Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot, Richard. The average transaction increase was impressive at that plus 2% range. Do you expect that that will be a dynamic that will continue and within consumer electronics, what are the major pluses there given that it had such nice performance? Richard, as we do model the next year, what is the magnitude of deflation in terms of the impacts to comps? Is it in the 100 basis point range? And just I think you mentioned several different categories but is there an overall take on which categories it is applying to most? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, starting with last question first. Again, I think the difference now is that we're seeing a little bit more deflation on some of the non-food items, particularly like, for example, plastic bags and garbage bags and things like that that require petroleum-based products. I still think again, you get the sound bites of the things that are down 10% and 20% but overall, if deflation as measured by our LIFO indexes are down, have been down 0.25% a year, and then last year maybe it was more than that. This year it seems like it's a little more. It's less than 1%. Maybe it's 0.5% to 1% instead of a 0.25% to 0.5%. But I'm guessing there. Then in terms of electronics, I think a couple things. I think arguably if we have a higher number that probably helps. We certainly over-indexed on bigger TVs. I know that during the four weeks between Thanksgiving and New Year's; Thanksgiving and Christmas we had outsized TV sales dollars in talking to every major supplier that we buy from relative to everybody else, online and offline, and I think part of that was is that over-indexing to the 60-inch and 80-inch TVs. But we're seeing strength in phones. TVs is the thing that drives it. Cameras are better. But then cameras are better because they were weaker the last couple years. Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC: And, Richard, just to remind us, as a percentage of the total what is consumer electronics? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : I have it in front of me. But I think Department 24, it's four or five. Four plus. Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : With the... Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC: And, Richard... Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : With TVs would probably 40%-plus of that. Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And Richard, as you think about Costco for the long-term just for the five-year story of Costco, we know that you don't have the buy online and pick up in store, the BOPiS, so what are customers asking for as you really try to execute to customer desires? Is there anything on the delivery speed front and mobile that you would highlight as where you are focusing efforts on in terms of your human capital and strategic priorities as you look to bricks and clicks over the long-term? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : One of the challenges we have with picking up at the store is, we've got an average location that's doing $175 million, $180 million which means we've got a bunch of locations that are doing $200 million to $300 million and several that are doing more than that. We don't want somebody to come by necessarily and pick it up. Maybe that would change if we were having minus 3% comps in our lives. So we want to do everything possible to get them in the store and not just come and pick something up. So I don't see that as being a strategic focus of ours, at least in the near term. We also \u2013 part of the thing of trying to get people in the store with treasure hunt items, with fresh foods, with gas. So we'll keep driving that. As we've done, our relationship with like the in six markets with Google Shopping and I think 16 markets with Instacart, there are people that want things delivered to them, and we're selling them. We're still selling it, but we're doing it that way. And so I think that's what we'll continue to do. We are getting better. And again, some out there would say we've gone from an F to a C or an F to a D. Some would say we've gone to a B plus. We'd like to think of ourselves as we still have some things to do, but we've improved our mobile apps. We've gotten a little smarter about how we do it. We know that when you come in store, you're going buy a lot more than when you shop online in general, and recognizing our average online transaction is actually higher than our in-store visit. But that's because we started with just big ticket items. It's just recently we've put on some other smaller ticket items. But we know that compared to let's say, an Instacart or a Google experience, the in-store visit is two-and-a-half to three times if not a little more than that. Now what we're finding is that that customer comes in a little less frequency, does the online several times, and then another, too, is an aggregate improvement in their comp. So that works. But we're still taking it slowly in terms of \u2013 I don't see us doing pickup at store at least in the near \u2013 in the next year or two, because we've got enough traffic there. We're trying figure out how to keep driving that. Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC: Richard, you have been experiencing such robust traffic and healthy fundamentals. What is your take on the health of the consumer because there seems to be different factors going on at different income levels and at the same time, there is definitely stock market volatility? And a related question is if there is something that keeps you up at night for the next year, what would you highlight as risk factors as you evaluate them and think about them internally? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, I think one of the things I read, first of all, first and foremost, when we do our competitive price shops, we feel as good if not better than ever. When we look at our renewal rates and our customer loyalty, we feel as good as ever. When we look at our employee loyalty and our turnover rates, we feel as good if not better than ever. We certainly like to read those nice things that everybody says about us. And I think it reinforces, and we're doing it because we do it and we then reap the benefit of it. So I think from that perspective, now at the same token, my favorite negative word or negative phrase out there, we talked about the volatility and the choppiness. There's a lot of what somebody referred to, not me, but toxic anxiety out there. The world is a little different. And this dollar strength doesn't help everything. And even the U.S. economy, while good, there's not a big engine driving it necessarily. So there is a lot going on out there. I think I'm comforted by our consistency even if it's come down a little bit in the last couple months. And I can explain some of that with the strength frequency a year ago. But look we'd still like an extra 0.5 point or 1 point there. In terms of what keeps me up at night, what do we as a company or what does Craig, our CEO, get, and what do Bob and I and Jeff ask about? You know a lot of it centers around dot com and what are you going to do. And we try to not avoid it or be arrogant about it but also recognize we try not to freak out about it. So I think in my older age, I lose sleep for age-related issues not the company-related issues. I really feel pretty good fundamentally about our company and what we've got going on, what we're doing in terms of global sourcing, what we're doing in terms of the strength of our current signature brand. And things could change, but we're \u2013 and we'll keep trying do a few things on the Internet more, but we're going to take it steady. Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC: Are you still selling tons of diamonds? Have your diamond luxury sales been really good? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yes. I mean, I know in fiscal 2015 they were up \u2013 percentage wise up like 150 plus thousand karats which is 15% or so. Yeah. Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Thank you. Best regards. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Operator : Meredith? Your line is open, you may be on mute? Operator : Your next question comes from line of Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks so much and good afternoon at this point. My first question relates to the U.S. versus international traffic and ticket mix. When the numbers were quite similar in terms of total sales or comp growth ex gas and FX for U.S. international, I guess we were a bit less curious about how the traffic trends you are seeing that you report which I believe are our global \u2013 correct me if I am wrong \u2013 were different so any sense as to how different the traffic number is in the U.S. particularly over the past few months? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : No. I mean, again, the biggest factor was a year ago, with the gas \u2013 our view was it was gas related. We had a couple of months of mid 5s which was anomaly the other way, so we're just finishing comparing to that. One surprise would be in Canada. The underlying comp there is surprisingly strong given that oil prices are down. When I look at for Q2, in terms of kind of front end transaction growth, which is shopping frequency, that's how we measure it. Overall we were again in the low 3s or the mid-3s. The U.S. was in the mid-2s. Although that's impacted again by \u2013 more impacted than anybody by gas. And by gas a year ago the shopping frequency. When I look internationally, it ranges from flat to up 14%. And no rhyme or reason it to. A little \u2013 well a little of it is in the Asian countries in Q2 was a little flatter because of opening new units as well. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. If I could also focus on sales for a second question, so I guess the difference really between January and February in the U.S. if you knock out the weather and Super Bowl, et cetera, it is actually seems to be at least in the overall number seems to be less about traffic and more about ticket. I know that there is a component of ticket that is obviously deflation. Is the decel in ticket ex-gas and FX in the past couple of months entirely about deflation or is there any change in basket size or units per basket, et cetera? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, it's basket size related to deflation. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So deflation pure and simple rather than any kind of units per transaction? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : A month ago \u2013 we don't do this all the time, but a month ago we had \u2013 Bob had everybody look \u2013 last two months, we looked at the basket size and the actual number of items in the basket? The number of items in the basket was up less than 1%, about 0.25%. And the average basket dollar amount was a little down. So that would imply again a little deflation, but we had to buy in slightly more things than a year ago. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Understood. And then finally on SG&A and the forward guide on wages just to be clear is what is different over the upcoming four quarters or so, simply the change in the entry-level hourly wage rather than the increases you would give your experienced team members or does that increase also flow through at a greater than usual rate to the...? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : The top of scale close to the same rate. But, again, if you have 60% percent of your employees who currently are making 22 or 23, whatever that top scale is, and every March we got to at $0.55, $0.60 an hour increase, we've experienced that through all times for 30 years percentage wise is pretty similar. The unique thing this time is the bottom of the scale which just taking \u2013 what would it be without it? And what'll be with it? It affects not only the entry level, it affects the first couple of increases. If we were at $11.50 and $12, was it \u2013 if we were $11.50 and $12 currently prior to now, three months or however many cumulative hours later, then somebody goes from $11.50 to $11.75. Then $11.75 to $12 or $12.25. Well, everybody below $13 is going to $13. But what's the incremental cost, all things being equal? The incremental cost is about $0.08 a share over the course of a year. It's a $0.01 this quarter because it's a partial quarter. And then it's more. It's about $0.02 a quarter. And then it will anniversary next year this time. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, and thanks for the transparency today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities. Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi, Richard. I just have a couple of questions I think. The first one is on the membership fee income growth, what would it have been without the impact of no American Express sign-ups? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : We don't measure it. On the margin we think somebody's coming to sign up because of us first and the co-brand card second. A distant second. Whether it's Amex or Citi Visa or anybody. They come in to be a member of Costco. I don't think they come to the desk and say never mind and walk away. So I think \u2013 now, because part of our relationship with our former partner and our upcoming new partner \u2013 current and soon-to-be-former partner and our upcoming new partner \u2013 is they do some marketing for us. They do some things to get people to come in also. So there's probably a little bit but we don't try to measure, we just know it's zero right now. Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then in your softlines business, there has been some \u2013 the private label component I think has increased and I was just wondering if you could talk through a little bit on the impact that weather has played in that segment of your business both from like a markdown perspective but also in terms of what you are really seeing as buying opportunities throughout the last few months in the current market? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, the only thing that was impactful is I believe there was a relatively warm \u2013 there was more men's outer wear markdowns this last few months than we had historically but it was completely weather-related. And I didn't even point it out on the call. That's probably a little bit of softline's impact. That was one of the reasons that the softline's margins I mentioned year-over-year was a little down. Beyond that, at the last budget meeting when we were looking at the \u2013 some of the apparel buyers came and talked about some of the new seasonal things, we keep getting a few more brands. I can't think of any off the top of my head right now. But I think it's a consistent \u2013 we've enjoyed Apparel business with comps in the 10% to 15% range compound for a couple years now. And we're still seeing decent growth in those areas. So it's a good category for us. I think we're trying a couple of men's athletic items. We've been very successful with the three pieces, the bottom, the top of the jacket. KS, I know we're bringing in a few other items on the men's pant. Not just the fancy wool pant but the khakis and the gabardines. Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Richard, just wanted to go back to the credit card transition. You've talked in the past about kind of reinvesting some of the savings but I think you just also mentioned maybe keeping a little bit of it. I'm just curious, is that a change, are you considering letting some more of that flow through \u2013 I mean you have had a lot of expense on the IT front now with the wage increase FX has been a headwind? So just curious if there is any change in how you are thinking about the savings there? And now that we are kind of very close to it, any comment on what those savings could be in terms of magnitude? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, no comments until we get there. So it really is going be probably not until early October when we report our year-end and fourth quarter numbers. Since early June would be the beginning of the first \u2013 about three weeks into our fourth quarter. So I can't really tell you anything about it. We've made no change in what piece of this bucket we're thinking of saving. If anything, as we went through the final negotiation several months ago of what the rewards structure would be, Craig pushed it further towards the customer, towards the member who would get this card. We want it to be a great card, and so if anything, we went the other way a little bit. I just mentioned \u2013 perhaps I didn't mention it that when I talk to people, as people have talked to me, my standard line has been like anything we do, when we save a buck on a piece of merchandise, we can buy better, and we're going to give, as a rule of thumb, the majority of it maybe 80% even 90% back to the customer. We're going to do the same thing here, we're going give most of it back to the member. That being said, again, in the throes of the final figuring out what exactly do we want the reward structure to be, and because we want that card to be top-of-wallet, as we do with our current co-brand. Top-of-wallet and be used not only at Costco but outside of Costco and to be used at Costco as much as possible. We \u2013 Craig pushed the envelope with us and with the third parties to make sure that that value proposition is geared more towards them than us. So there's been no change in terms of that. Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. That is helpful. And then just on the transition, will you have any grace period for a member that say doesn't have the cobranded card but tends to use their AmEx at the store and didn't get a new card in the mail obviously but gets up to the register and goes to pay and you are not taking AmEx anymore or will they just have to find a debit card or have you thought about how to treat that situation? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, first of all, there's going be a lot of communication several times by us to our members about timing and everything. Contractually, there's a lot of things we can't do until near the end. There will be plenty of information provided. We're still going to upset a few members when they come in. We did it with gas pumps years ago when we stopped accepting certain things. And \u2013 but at the end of the day, there will be plenty of opportunities. The fact is that there will be some members that have an existing Visa card in their wallet while we would prefer them to have ours. There will be cannibalization that way. Frankly, there will be some cannibalization. Look, whether it's American Express or Citi or any other big credit card issuer, they're the bank that determines credit eligibility for somebody signing up. Now that doesn't impact the portfolio people, all the people that have the current co-brand. They're going to get a new card similar in terms of credit capacity and things from their existing co-brand relationship. But somebody who has to sign up, there are millions of people that never got an Amex card because they couldn't. They have resorted to debit or cash or check. There are some of those people that haven't \u2013 will be thrilled. There's some debit cardholders that will do this. But when you add it all up, we think that it's a net \u2013 we know that it's a net positive certainly in terms of what we've negotiated, and we'll see where it goes from there. Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. That's helpful and then if I could just ask one more on online. A lot of retailers are spending a lot of money investing in their online business. It has kind of pressured the margins for them there. I believe your e-commerce business is higher margin. Just curious how you think about spending there going forward and is that higher margin structure sustainable? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): In terms of online, just a lot of retailers have been talking about how much they are investing in their online business and that pressuring their margins for that side of the business. I believe Costco's margins online are higher margin and I am just curious how you think about spending there, and is that higher margin structure for e-commerce as sustainable? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, first of all, our gross margins online are a little lower. Its operating margin is quite a bit higher because you have a substantially lower SG&A. Now the fact that we're not spending hundreds of millions of dollars online perhaps is part of that. But at the end of the day, we certainly make more when that dollar is sold online than it is in-store. And notwithstanding the fact that our gross margin, what we charge the member is lower online than it is in-store. Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I guess the question is do you see that sustainable? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : I do because the SG&A portion is so low and because we're so extreme. Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for letting it go so long. I just wanted to poke at the environment that almost everyone seems to be operating in right now. I mean I think you talked about traffic and I assume February traffic is in that kind of 2 to 2.5 range too. Talked about the deflation outlook. We talked about wages going up. I guess as you kind of move forward here and this is not just a Costco question, I guess this is from an analyst perspective that covers a lot of retail, it seems like everybody is facing a lot of the same challenges. I mean, do you see a light at the end of the tunnel? We had deflation now minus 1 maybe, we have wage inflation, we have traffic that has kind of come down a little bit. Not a great environment and so it seems again that maybe something has to give here. Is the wage inflation going to finally pick up demand? Where does this in your opinion kind of end? Even Costco which is probably one of the best retailers in the world domestically is feeling the pressure. And I'm just trying to understand what is the end game here generally and I don't know if you have any thoughts on that? That's my question. Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : I don't know if this will give you comfort or anxiety. We're going to keep doing what we do. In bad times, we probably have the benefit of being more aggressive to drive stuff. And if anything, I think we're doing it from a stronger position now than we've ever been in. We're going out there driving prices down. We see our competitive moat actually even relative to traditional brick and mortars, not only our direct competitors but other forms of \u2013 and not just clubs but other forms of category diamond retailers. That moat has widened a little bit of late \u2013 of late being the last year or two. And the answer around here is well, can we get a little more margin? And the answer is, of course no, if we could drive more business so we could make it tougher on everybody. So I think \u2013 and then again, I think some of the things we're doing in terms of our strength with our vendors and our global sourcing, all that stuff, that helps. We've got a \u2013 we're doing a lot of good things. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : So do you have concern though given the slow wind down that we are seeing, Richard, a little bit on the components I mentioned, higher costs, yet deflation and the traffic? I mean is that \u2013 I think someone asked what do you stay up at night? I mean I guess I'm old too, it's hard to stay up because you're getting old but generally does that get you a little nervous as you look at the business and is the broader economy that something is just a little off? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, I think I used the word earlier I quoted from some economist about toxic anxiety. The world is filled with it. Our economy is darn good compared to a lot of them out there. And the fact that wages are increasing and unemployment has improved, all that's positive. And frankly, higher wages at the lowest wage levels is, in my view, is a positive. I think we've just got our head down and doing a lot of good things. I think that what we're doing again on some of the global sourcing stuff is something that very few can touch. And the strength of our KS brand name, and we're going to figure out how to create more value. So other than everybody in the world never wanting to leave their house and only typing stuff to order and get it at the front door, other than that risk, I think that the strength of our merchandising, the strength of our competitiveness, the fact that we're able to be successful in other countries, I come to every four-week budget meeting and listen to merchants and some of the things they're doing. And I go out and feel better about what we've got going on. So in terms of \u2013 I think by the way, when it is tougher for everybody else, everybody else does it less extreme than us. They figure out ways to cut costs that aren't necessarily long-term the right way or as right of a way in our view. And maybe we're righteous and we're standing on our own pedestal here, but it seems to have worked for us through good and bad economies. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Perfect. Thanks for taking my question. Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Okay. We're going to take two more questions. Operator : Okay. And your next one comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Gregory Melich - Evercore ISI : Hi. Thanks. I have two questions, Richard. What drove the acceleration in membership fee income growth besides the Living Social program? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Well, Living Social had virtually no impact because it's deferred accounting. Even if we had a little bump in that first week, or last week of Q2, when the Living Social thing was happening, virtually none of it hits the income statement. Because for a new member, that $55 or $110 goes into the P&L over the next 12 months. And my guess is it's probably some strength a year earlier that we're not getting the full benefit of that. Gregory Melich - Evercore ISI : Okay. Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : It might even be strong membership. Gregory Melich - Evercore ISI : That is the best reason. So I guess the second question then is on the ancillary business because I know these have been growing a lot and you gave us a few numbers I think last quarter. Is there any way to sort of pull those together and say what percentage of your members are doing a car rental or a travel program or car buying or one of these things that \u2013 is it 5% of the transactions if you think of it that way? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : I think some of those services, it's 1% or less. I think one number that we've seen and presented in some of our PowerPoint Presentations, I think last year we had car rentals above about 2.5 million car rentals. Let's assume 2.5 million car rentals weren't 2.5 million mutually exclusive customers. But maybe it was 2 million members. I don't know if it's 1.5 million or 2 million. But if it was even 2 million members that would be less than 10%. Probably 7% or 8%. So, my guess is less than that. So, maybe 5%. We've got \u2013 not everybody needs a mortgage, not everybody is doing forms check printing. On some of the items like, as a percentage of our total membership base it low. But there's a lot of room for it to grow. Gregory Melich - Evercore ISI : So basically that nice tailwind to gross margin, that could be there for a while if we continue to get... Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I think it is. I haven't \u2013 absolutely. It probably over time moves the needle a little. It definitely moves the needle a little positively. Gregory Melich - Evercore ISI : Great. All right. Good luck. Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray. Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi. Good morning. So just following up on the Living Social deal, understanding that the deferred accounting doesn't really impact it but how did that impact the total membership numbers for the quarter? And then also how was the retention rate really on the one that you had about 18 months ago? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : I aggregate number of members, we signed up a few more than we did the last time. And I think the 4% increase would be lower and it would be somewhere north of zero and south of 4%. Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. But the mechanics of the program when somebody buys that deal, they automatically they get it done. They don't have to take it to the warehouse to get activated? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : They buy the coupon or whatever online. They print it out. They go to the warehouse where they sign up for a membership. Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. So you don't get those... Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : It's that latter take that when we represent, when we recognize it as a member and when we start our deferred accounting. Which will be small in first year because you have offsets, you have a value proposition to that purchaser. Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. So there could be more people that are signing up in the current quarter that we are in now that have purchased that deal? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : There will be. Yeah. Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): And then I guess the second question would be just around \u2013 you didn't talk much about the other international business being flat in February. You did say something that the Chinese New Year but is there something going on in the Japan business? You haven't called it out in the monthly for a long time as being a real positive contributor to comps. Just any comment you can elaborate on for February for other international and then also specifically in Japan? Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : I think in Japan the last couple years we've had probably a little more cannibalization and their economy is soft. I know of late, again, as it relates to the strong dollar, in all countries where the dollar is much stronger there is a little weakness in some of the bigger ticket items. Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Not big but there's (1:37:40) a little. Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. Thank you, Richard. Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. Have a good day.

My name is Karen and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn today's call over to Mr. Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Galanti, you may begin. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Karen and good morning to everyone. Before I begin, please note that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, events and or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. Last night's press release reported our third-quarter and year-to-date fiscal 2016 operating results for the 12 and 36-week periods that ended this past May 8. For the quarter, our reported earnings per share came in at $1.24, up 6% over last year's third-quarter earnings per share of $1.17. In comparing our third-quarter results year-over-year, there are a few items of note. As usual, FX as compared to a year ago, during the quarter, the foreign currencies in the countries where we operate weakened overall versus the US dollar, primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea. This resulted in our foreign earnings in Q3 when converted into US dollars for reporting purposes being lower by about $15 million, or $0.03 a share than they would have been had the various foreign exchange rates versus the dollar been flat year-over-year. Gross margins. On a reported basis, it was higher by 34 basis points. This included a $19 million benefit from nonrecurring legal settlements. This represented 7 basis points of margin improvement, or about $0.03 a share. Number three, our co-branded credit card transition in the United States. With the transition to our new co-brand Citi Visa card next month, co-brand AMEX credit card sign-up stopped, as you know, late last calendar year, I think in October, November. The short-term negative earnings impact of the lost co-brand credit card sign-ups in the quarter year-over-year was about $11 million, or $0.02 a share to the negative. We expect to have the new co-brand Visa cards in the hands of our members by the end of May, early June, some of you may have already received them in the mail - with a go live transition date of Monday, June 20. Number four, wages. As I mentioned on last quarter's, second-quarter earnings conference call back in March, in addition to the - we do a top-of-scale increase each year, which we generally again have done every year each March. This year, we also increased our bottom-scale hourly rates in the US and Canada, which is about 80% of our company. Effective this past March 14, we increased our starting wage at $1.50 an hour to $13 and $13.50 an hour. The new bottom of scale wage increase results in a year-over-year incremental payroll expense of about $6 million, or $0.01 a share in the quarter. We estimate that this will be anywhere from $0.01 to $0.02 a quarter in each of the next three quarters depending on which way it rounds. Number five, IT modernization. IT modernization efforts negatively impacted SG&A expenses in Q3 on an incremental year-over-year basis by about $16 million, which is about 5 basis points, or $0.02 a share to SG&A. I believe in the first and second quarters this year that year-over-year delta of modernization expense was 7 basis points to the negative in Q1 and 3 in Q2. So it looks like it's averaging around 5 a quarter for the first three quarters of the year. LIFO. This year in Q3, we picked up a little bit there from a LIFO credit. We recorded a pretax LIFO credit of $13 million in the quarter. Last year, it was also deflationary, but as you know deflation has continued. It was $7 million, so again about a $6 million, or a penny a share delta there. Those are the items I'd point out. Turning to our third-quarter sales, total reported sales, as you know, as reported, was up 2% and our 12-week reported comp sales figure was flat or zero. Sales, of course, were negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation. That was almost 2 percentage points impact and about 190 basis points and by the weakening foreign currencies relative to the dollar that I just mentioned. That was about 145 basis points. So excluding gas deflation, the flat US comp number we reported would have been a plus 3%. In Canada, the plus 1% reported Canadian comp would've been a plus 8% in local currency, excluding gas deflation and flat FX rates. And the reported minus 2% other international, excluding gas deflation and assuming flat over year FX, that would've been a plus 3%. So all told, our reported zero comp for the quarter, ex-gas and FX, would have been a plus 3%. In terms of new openings, in the quarter, we opened 7 new locations and also completed one relo. So year-to-date for the first 36 weeks, we've opened a total of 19 new warehouses and 3 relos. For all of 2016, we have a current plan of 29 net new locations; a little over two-thirds of them, 21, will be in the US; two in Canada; two in Japan; and one each in the UK, Taiwan, Australia and Spain. This morning, I will also, of course, review with you e-commerce activities, membership trends and renewal rates, additional discussion about margins and SG&A in the quarter and a couple of other items. So going down the P&L, again, for sales. Total sales were up 2%. Reported comps flat. Reported, up 3%, excluding gas and FX. Now the zero flat comp on a reported basis was a combination of an average transaction decrease of a little under 3%, minus 2.7%, on a reported basis. And again ex-gas and FX, the average transaction increase would've actually been up 0.5%. And the average shopping frequency increase was up 3% for the quarter, which is most of February, all of March, all of April and a little of May. In terms of sales comparisons by geography, in the US, Texas, Midwest and South East regions were the stronger ones. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Mexico, Canada and the UK. In terms of merchandising categories for the quarter, within food and sundries, which was overall flattish year-over-year, sundries, foods and meat, deli were the leaders. Tobacco, as I think we mentioned a little bit on the April sales call, was negative in the low teens as we continue to eliminate tobacco from various locations. For hardlines overall in the mid-single digits. The departments with the strongest results were sporting goods, toys, seasonal, automotive, consumer electronics and garden/patio. I think I will have to go look at what was down because those were all pretty good departments within hard lines. Within low to mid-single softline comps, single-digit softline comps, small electronics, men's apparel and home furnishings were the standouts. And lastly, in fresh foods, comp sales overall in the low single digits. Produce and deli showed the best results. Of course, we probably had the most deflation I think in the meat, poultry and pork areas. In the US, we continue to see deflation in the low single digit range for food and sundries, and as I mentioned fresh foods, and a little in some of the non-food areas as well, notably electronics. Moving down the income statement, membership fees came in - in dollars were up 6% and up 7 basis points as a percent of sales, coming in up $34 million from $584 million last year to $618 million. Again, FX currencies, exchange rates impact this number. Without FX, we are assuming flat year-over-year FX. The $618 million would have been up $7 more million and so the 6% dollar increase year-over-year would have been up 7. Same number of basis points, of course, up 7. In terms of renewal rates, we continue at strong renewal rates, 90% plus in the US and Canada, 88% worldwide. Continue increasing penetration of the executive membership and I will talk about that in a second. New member signups in the quarter companywide were at 15% year-over-year in part driven by strong sign-ups at our new openings in Taiwan and Japan. The Asia openings always have outsized new sign-ups. We also had very strong sign-ups in Tulsa, for that matter. Overall, in the US, in fact, it was up 15% as well. In terms of number of members at third quarter-end, Gold Star was 36.2 million, up from 12 weeks earlier at 35.4 million; primary business, the same at 7.2 million; business add-ons, the same at 3.5 million at the beginning and the end of the quarter. So all told, 46.9 million member households, up 800,000 from 46.1 million at Q2 end. Total cardholders is 85.5 million, up 1.5 million from 84 million at the end of the second quarter. I mentioned executive memberships. We came in at the end of Q3 with right at 17 million executive members, which is an increase of actually 402,000 over the 12 week period, or 33,000 a week increase in the quarter. I think that tends to be on the high end of that weekly increase in many of the last recent quarters, executive members are approximately 36% of our member base and about two-thirds of our sales and continues to improve penetration. In terms of renewal rates, business members were 94.4% at the end of the quarter, tweaked down from 94.5%; Gold Star, 89.6%, a tenth down also, 89.7%; and so total US and Canada, 90.4%, down from 90.5%, worldwide, at 87.6% at the end of the quarter, again a tenth down as well. Within the US and Canada, of course, we've seen a bigger tickdown than a tenth of a percent in Canada. That has to do with as we anniversary now about 18 months when we initiated the change in credit cards up there, which was actually everybody having to sign up again. So I think part of that is the auto renewal. We see a little of that in the US since we haven't been adding on, accepting new applications for the current co-branded credit card since past October, but pretty much in line with what we thought. In terms of gross margin, our reported gross margin, as I may have mentioned, was up 34 basis points, 11.43% this year versus 11.09% last year. And as usual, I will ask you to jot down four columns of numbers to provide a little edification here. The four columns would be Q2 2016. Columns 1 and 2 are both Q2 2016. These are year-over-year changes in basis points. First column would be reported figures for margin. Second would be without the impact of gas deflation since that tends to distort the numbers wildly. And then columns 3 and 4 would be Q3 2016 both reported and in column 4, Q3 2016 without gas deflation. In terms of the line items, the first line item going across would be core merchandising, so Q2 2016, we reported a plus 5 basis point year-over-year. Ex-gas deflation, it was minus 3. In Q3, reported, plus 16 and ex-gas, minus 2, ancillary, a plus 9 and a plus 7. And then columns 3 and 4, a plus 9 and a plus 4. 2% reward, minus 1 and 0. And in Q3, reported without gas, 0 and plus 2. LIFO in the second quarter, plus 4, plus 4; in the third quarter, plus 2, plus 2. Other, 0 and 0 in the first two columns and a plus 7 in columns 3 and 4, that's those nonrecurring legal settlements I talked about earlier. You add up those columns reported in Q2 year-over-year, we had an up 17 basis point margin and up 8 on an ex-gas deflation basis. And again, as well, we reported a plus 34. It's a plus 13 ex-gas deflation. In terms of the core merchandise component, which again reported plus 16, but minus 2, if you look at the four key categories, which is 80% plus of our business, food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percentage of their own sales, they were positive year-over-year by 16 basis points with food and sundries, hardlines and softlines all being up year-over-year and fresh foods being slightly down during the quarter year-over-year. Ancillary and other business -- by the way, those numbers exclude the non-recurring items that I mentioned -- ancillary and other business margins were up 9 basis points, up 4 without gas and within the quarter on their own sales, gas, optical and hearing aids all showed higher gross margins year-over-year as a percent of their own sales. I mentioned LIFO already. That was a 2 basis point benefit year-over-year and other, again a 7 basis point improvement year-over-year. So even ex that on an ex-gas deflation basis, margins were up a few basis points year-over-year. Moving down to expenses, SG&A. On a reported basis, were higher by 33 basis points coming in at 10.44 compared to 10.11 a year ago. Again, we will do the same four columns, Q2 reported and without gas and then Q3 reported and without gas. Core operations, minus 22 reported year-over-year and a minus means higher year-over-year. Ex-gas in Q2 was a minus 16. Columns 3 and 4, minus 24 and minus 8. Central in Q2 was a minus 8 and minus 7; Q3, minus 6 and minus 4; stock compensation, minus 4 and minus 4 and then a minus 3 and a minus 2 and no quarterly adjustments. So all told, we reported year-over-year in Q2 SG&A higher by 34 basis points on a reported basis and 27 ex-gas. This quarter Q3 reported higher SG&A by 33, 14 higher ex-gas. Basically within the -- if you go back to the core operations or operations, the ex-gas deflation, the 8 basis points year-over-year higher, that consisted of higher payroll and benefits year-over-year, which impacted that minus 8 by minus 12, so more to the minus 8. These items were somewhat offset by a variety of other controllable expense items. Q2 is of course always the lowest volume quarter and of course, as we know, sales were a little weaker for a variety of reasons, including some inflation. Central expense was higher year-over-year in the quarter by 6, ex-gas by 4. IT is the 4 on an ex-gas basis. It was minus 5 on a reported, but essentially ex that. Central did a pretty good job in the quarter purchasing that. And again, stock compensation expense, no surprise there. Next on the income statement, pre-opening, a little higher year-over-year, $18 million for the quarter versus $14 million a year ago, so up by a basis point. This year in the quarter, we had 8 openings, including one relo. Last year in the quarter, we had 4 openings, including 1 relo. Again, some of that is not necessarily related to those specific openings as it may include some right before the quarter opened as well. All told, operating income came in at $858 million for the 12-week quarter, up $37 million, or up 5% year-over-year from last year's $821 million. Below the operating income, interest expense, interest expense came in at $30 million this year versus $31 million a year ago, essentially flat, no surprises there. Interest income and other this year was $7 million, lower by $2 million versus last year's $9 million. Actual interest income within interest income and other was essentially similar year-over-year at about $10 million; the balance of that delta was year-over-year it was the other category coming from small foreign exchange adjustments and slight year-over-year changes in whatever other is, other earnings. No big surprise there. Overall, pretax income was higher by 4.5%, or $36 million, coming in at $835 million, up from $799 million a year earlier. Our tax rate was a little lower or better year-over-year coming in at 34.2%, down from 35.0% last year in the third quarter. Basically, this year's third-quarter income tax percentage benefited from again just a few positive discrete items in the aggregate going our way. That's why it was a little lower. Our normalized rate is actually just a shade over 35% in both of those quarters. Overall, reported net income of $545 million for the quarter compared to last year's $516 million or up 5.5%. For a quick rundown of other topics, typical topics -- well, the balance sheet is included in the morning's press release. A couple of balance sheet info items that you may not see on there : depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $291 million and $847 million year to date. Accounts payable as a percent of inventories, on a reported basis it was 99%, a percentage point lower than a year ago at 100%. That of course includes non-merchandise payables, such as construction payables, same kind of delta. The 99% reported this year would have been at 89%, the 100% would have been at 90%, so again right around the same year-over-year. Average inventory per warehouse was actually down about $0.5 million, or down 4%. About a third of that is FX, so almost exactly a third, $173,000 of $516,000. The rest is pretty much spread across many categories, including the impact from deflation. If you assume, and again, you never know exactly what the deflationary cost amounts are, but if you assume a 1% deflation, you get somewhere about half of that remaining being gas and the rest being just a little lower inventories, but, again, lower year-over-year by about $0.5 million. In Q3 in terms of CapEx, we spent $460 million during the 12-week period and essentially year-to-date we are right at $1.8 billion. I would estimate for the year we will come in at around $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion compared to fiscal 2015 total expenditures of $2.4 billion. So up $100 million to $300 million from a year ago based on whatever timing we have left here and what expenditures are made. In terms of Costco Online, as you know, we are now in six countries -- US, Canada, UK and Mexico, plus the recently launched countries of Korea and Taiwan. In the quarter, sales and profits are up. Sales were up on a reported basis 14% in the quarter, up about 15.5% ex-FX. On a comp basis, that would be 13% and 14% ex-FX. In terms of expansion, again, I mentioned in the quarter that we are in now, which is a 16-week quarter, we would expect to open 10 new openings plus 1 relo, and again, that would put us at 29 net new openings, 33 openings, but 4 of those were relos, so 29 overall. In fiscal 2015, we added 23 net new units on a base of 663, so about 3.5% square footage growth. In 2016, the 29 on the new base would be about 4.5% square footage growth, slightly lower unit growth, but you tend to open a little bigger unit since you've got the relos as well. New locations by country again, 21 in the US, 2 in Canada, 1 each in the UK, Taiwan, Australia and Spain and 2 in Japan. As of third quarter-end, our total square footage was right above 100 million at 100.7 million square feet. In terms of stock buybacks, if you recall in Q1, we repurchased $130 million of our common stock; in Q2, $80 million. Both of those are, of course, 12-week quarters as well and in the 12-week third quarter, we purchased $136 million such that year-to-date we've spent about $346 million with an average price per share of $148.64. If you annualized those quarters, and again, we will see what we do this quarter, but if you annualize it, we are right at $0.5 billion for the year. We'd be right at $0.5 billion for the year. We will see where we come out. In terms of dividends, as you know, last quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend rate year-over-year to a quarterly amount of $0.45. I believe that was up from $0.40 for the prior year each quarter. That $1.80 a share annualized dividend represents a total cost to the Company of around $790 million. Before I turn the call back to Karen for Q&A, I want to mention a slight timing change each quarter when we report our quarterly results. Many of you have asked about the fact that we report earnings the night before, usually around 6 :00 Pacific time, then you've get to wait until the next morning to hear the call. Beginning with our fourth quarter earnings release, we are going to change the timing of that release and the conference call such that, for the fourth quarter, we will issue results after the market closes on Thursday, September 29, followed up shortly thereafter with a live conference call that afternoon and a Q&A session at the end of that call. This new schedule will be our plan for earnings releases going forward and I think it'll be helpful and certainly in response to several of your comments out there. The last quick item, next week, we report the four weeks of calendar May sales. This is the four weeks ending this coming Sunday, May 29. I will mention to you that, based on how Memorial Day falls year-over-year, this year, Memorial falls on day one of the June retail calendar month, so this year, we have 28 days versus last year's 27 days. So that will be a little benefit. Again, we'll all point that out. June, there's really a wash. You've got a detriment related to Memorial Day. You've got a date pick up on the other end of June with how July 4 falls, and then finally we will get through that silliness in July where we report July sales. With that, I will open up to Q&A, and I will turn it back to you, Karen. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Oliver Chen of Cowen and Company. Steven Zaccone : Hi. Good morning. This is Steven Zaccone on for Oliver Chen. Thanks for taking our questions. Just two questions from us. Firstly, we wanted to get your take on the health of the customer base for you. There is been some different trends among retailers reported thus far in earnings. Wanted to just get your sense have you seen any changes in trends or spending habits? Second question, just wanted to get your thoughts on progress with some of the third-party partnerships in grocery delivery. How has growth in those channels performed relative to expectations and then just thoughts about expanding into new markets? Thanks very much. Richard Galanti : Okay. Well, in terms of the customer, so far so good. We don't see any dramatic change. Many of you have asked questions or have had some concern about traffic coming down from this 4% plus number over seven years. We feel pretty good about where our numbers are. We don't really see a lot of different changes. Interestingly, when you look at nondiscretionary items like food and sundries versus discretionary items across the nonfoods categories, including big-ticket items like furniture, electronics and the like, we've actually had, relatively speaking, a little more strength in some of those nonfood categories. So that I think allays some of any concerns that some people have had. But generally speaking, I'd have to say our customers are still pretty healthy and we are still getting good renewal rates notwithstanding a very small impact from some of the credit card transitions and so we feel pretty good at this point about that. And certainly I feel good about some of the merchandising stuff that we've got going on. By the way, one of the other data points I've been asked several times in the last few weeks each time we've reported sales in the last couple of months is is it deflation, is it weakness, is it dotcom, whatever. The fact of the matter is, if you look at during the 12-week quarter on a year-over-year basis, if we just take the average items per unit in the basket going through the front end, US only, so US only, it was up 1.4%. So we are getting people to buy more items, if you will. The average basket value is up 0.4%. The simple implication there is you've got deflation presumably -- deflationary pressures of about 1%. Now that's a good educated guess. There could be other impacts of sizes, but typically we go into bigger sizes, not smaller sizes and bigger pack sizes. So I think overall there's probably still a little bit more deflation that we've seen over the last couple of quarters spread to other items in the nonfood category as well as we've seen. In terms of third-party partnerships, we are pretty agnostic. We have good relationships with Google in regard to Google Shopping Express. We have Instacart, of course, Google's, in six large communities in the country -- the Bay area, the LA area and a few others and Instacart I think is now in well over 15, maybe even 20 markets where we participate with them, and also a few of the others out there. In terms of expectations, we didn't know what to expect. I believe that we generally are the anchor tenant, if you will, in many of these opportunities where there is more than just Costco items being purchased and sold just to provide to the end consumer, and so we think it's been good. It's still small relative to -- we still want you to come into the warehouse and we are going to still figure out how to continue to do that, but it's growing nicely and it's certainly on a small scale a bit of a help. In terms of expansion plans, I think you asked about openings, looks like our goal is still similar next year, about 30. We will shoot for something a little over 30 and end up about 30 if history repeats itself. We probably had a few more relative to that 30 number, a few more in the US this year than we would have anticipated if you would have asked me a few years ago. I think some of that is timing. We've had success in the US and probably the expectation of some of the markets we've gone into in the last couple of years, if you asked me five years ago, would we be going into some of these markets where we have never been in and our competitors have been in for up to 30 years. We've had success in those markets, whether it's Mobile or Tulsa or Toledo or Rochester and New Orleans, and so probably there's a few more in those markets on top of the few that we opened like whatever [indiscernible] number we have in the Puget Sound or LA, where they are harder to find because we are very specific locations to fill in markets. So I think that's probably one thing. Looking at the 30 next year, and this is a guess, it's probably not two-thirds, not 21 over 29. If I had to guess, it's probably a little less than half, 50%, 52%. And again, that's a guess at this point. Steven Zaccone : Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Good morning. Simeon Gutman. Richard, the Visa transition besides the timing that started a little later, anything else to think about? Interchange fees probably start to go down when it happens, but are there other costs that make your SG&A or any other line items elevated temporarily? Richard Galanti : No, same old stuff that we've talked about in terms of some of those things like having not signed up new co-branded cards since last October, November. There's part of any of these equations are different pockets of income, including generating new sign-ups, new credit card sign-ups and that's been about 4 million to 5 million a month, which is easy. It used to be something and now it's nothing until June. Other than that, no, we've just got a lot of people on our side and on the issuer side doing a lot of work to make sure it goes as smoothly as possible and we are excited about it. It's a great reward for our members improvement wise and we will keep a little of it ourselves in terms of merchant fee reduction and really there's not a whole lot \u2013 yes, cards are hitting right now in fact. They will continue to hit, when you've got literally over 10 million pieces of mail going out, it's spread over a few week period, and I think they just started hitting. So cards should be in everybody's hands a few days to a week -- at least a few days to a week before the June 20th D day here. And we will be able to tell you more in September on the -- late September when we do the fourth quarter earnings call, but again we are ready to go and we are excited about it. Simeon Gutman : And then the marketing dollars, the in-store kiosks, like you said the mailing, that's -- we are not going to see a blip good or bad in the SG&A dollar run rate? There's nothing unusual that should happen as we sequence there? Richard Galanti : Absolutely. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then my follow-up on gross margin, I think you mentioned that looking at I think it was the gasoline with the optical business, I think you said it was higher year-over-year and if that's the case, can you explain I guess how you are doing -- I thought we were cycling the hump of some of the best performing gasoline gross margin quarters a year ago. Maybe it was the mix of optical, but figure that gas is a bigger input. Richard Galanti : Yes, it will come in Q4. This quarter was an odd quarter. It ended up being -- in the first part of the quarter, it was better than we expected and with gas prices going up and down -- going up right now, it's been a little weaker the last couple weeks, but it was probably a little stronger near the beginning and into the middle of the quarter than we had anticipated, and it's generally two things. I think the bigger factor is, is when there's daily price changes up and down in the cost of -- procurement cost of both us and other gas station operators and then when it goes down, we seem to feel that we get a little extra margin in part because our competitors don't give as much back as fast as we do. So we still give way more back and it helps us a little bit. And so I think part of that new normal, if you will, over the last couple of years in that regard, it's probably on average a little better. Simeon Gutman : Okay, thank you. Richard Galanti : You will see it in Q4 though. I say that today. Day-to-day sometimes it changes relative to what -- just when we think we are smart and it's safe to go out, it goes the other way. But so far I guess it'll impact us in Q4. Simeon Gutman : But in Q4 being the hump and then it gets easier after that? Richard Galanti : Yes. Simeon Gutman : Okay, great. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot. Good morning, Richard. My first question relates to margin. Can you just talk about the degree to which moving food prices, I guess a deflation issue, and/or FX would've contributed to margin rate in any way? Richard Galanti : Well, the only thing that FX does is -- needless to say, in most other countries, some of their goods are US-sourced or US-dollar payable. In Canada, it is substantial, frankly. And we manage that and we lock in, you know, in a way natural hedges during the quarter once the buyers are comfortable with that exchange rate and what they're going to be able to price it at. But my guess is they are still - when you've got - when you look at, let's say in Canada year-over-year the Canadian dollar is 17% weaker, incrementally just in the quarter 5% weaker from the previous month. So you've got that kind of stuff going on from the previous quarter. You are going to have probably a little margin pressure there. Notwithstanding the margins are up a little. I think generally we try to bring down prices when there's deflation and probably doesn't impact us as much because -- it impacts us a little sooner than others and that's pretty much it. Matthew Fassler : Got it. And then LIFO, I guess, it's I think the seventh consecutive quarter where this has gone your way and I know you market to the best of your expectations at the end of every quarter. How much of this is food, and if we think about commodity prices, I know once again this should be zero in a normative environment. Any sense of whether there's more momentum that could prove helpful to you here? Richard Galanti : I don't think -- again, deflation from the end of the year is down about 0.8 [ph] of a percent in terms of a LIFO index. And the other comment I made, it was about 1%. Ask the question again. I was looking at one thing. Go ahead. Matthew Fassler : I guess the question is how much of the movement in LIFO, the ongoing credits, relate to food and based on commodity prices that you see, any desire to venture a guess as to where LIFO goes next? Richard Galanti : We don't know. If you talk to our fresh foods buyers, they are continuing to expect some deflation. I get different answers from some of the non-foods buyers. Mind you, when we look at fresh foods year-over-year, those margins were down slightly in the low double-digit basis points year-over-year, so again not a big impact there. It's the other categories where it was up a little bit, and so the net of all those four main categories, it was up 16 basis points. I don't think there is lots... Matthew Fassler : And then, finally, any sense thinking about the very long run about whether your food -- how your food market share moves if at all when prices are deflationary and perhaps consumers see some of the prices that they had only seen at Costco for a long time at other retailers? Richard Galanti : Well, first and foremost, I think we continue to believe that we will continue to see increasing penetration of the stuff we sell in fresh foods. Nobody doesn't like us. The quality levels and the values are awesome and some of the things we are doing with global sourcing initiatives and poultry plants and organic -- our pounds in beef are way up, but you've got deflation in beef more than some of the other protein categories. We are the first to go down in some of those items when there is deflation. So I think our numbers have actually -- the deflation in some of the fresh food categories I think mask some of the pound strength, if you will or the unit strength that we have whether it's protein or produce. And I would never be so arrogant to say that nobody can catch us, but we've got some great things going on in terms of again global sourcing, working with vendor partners. And we looked at our produce today, which is I think a $6 billion business now, approaching a $6 billion business, which is as big as protein. I don't think many retail food places do those kind of numbers. And so I think it has more to do with that than, yes, there's probably going to be a little bit of a macro shift, whatever. I think what we do and how we do it dwarfs those other impacts. Now there's other players coming into the market. I think just this week you've got a 365 opening and you've got other people coming to town with different health-related organic-related types of retail formats. We are pretty good at that stuff too and again, you've got to like bigger sizes, but we are pretty awesome in the fresh area and I think that will continue to -- should be for us an increased sales penetration area and something that'll keep driving our members... Matthew Fassler : Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thanks, Richard. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matt Lasser of UBS. Matt Lasser : Thanks a lot for taking my question. Richard, you sized the P&L impact of the credit card transition at $11 million. Presumably, that's just from lost sign-up -- credit card sign-ups. Are you able to tease out any impact from spending as a result of this transition? So for example, maybe some of the holders don't know that they can still use their card and so they put it away and that changes their behavior... Richard Galanti : There's always going to be a little confusion. To the extent that we haven't signed up new co-brand credit card members, I don't think many members -- many people coming into sign up for a Costco membership have walked away because we don't -- they can't sign up for the new AMEX card. If they have an AMEX card in their wallet, they can use that one. Now, to the extent that they don't have an AMEX card in their wallet, or to the extent that they -- keep in mind, not everybody that signed up for one over the last 16 years got it. It was still a credit eligibility decision that the issuer made and it'll be that way in the future. The fact of the matter though is is that, to the extent that they signed up as a member, and again I don't think it was that impactful, somebody walking away because they can't get an AMEX card, they have to use a debit card in their wallet or cash or check. Now, on a macro basis, does that impact some of the big-ticket items? Yes, it probably does. Although our TV sales have been pretty darn strong. So I can talk out of both sides of my mouth on this one. Matt Lasser : So does that mean that some of the comp slowdown just may be a function of the law of diminishing returns mass taking over? Richard Galanti : It could be. Again, the ones we can quantify easily we look at. We can drive ourselves crazy. We know that -- let's face it, in April sales when we tried to -- when we shared with many of you on our audio, it's everything. It's deflation, it's a little of the AMEX. Maybe it's getting closer to the line of maximizing marginal whatever. At the end of the day, we are still rolling out gas stations. We are still rolling out some of the ancillary businesses. We are still opening up new warehouses. We are expanding fresh foods as we have over the last several years. People ask us about what are some of our new areas and certainly what we do with ticketing and executive member services, all those things -- wine and spirits I think we've been surprised by that -- these are all small things, they are all needle movers, but small movements. But I've always said there's lots of little things that help us here. Matt Lasser : And my last question is, to the extent that you've already seen some of your existing AMEX cardholders clip up their card and switch to Visa, and it's having an impact on your sales, do you think that's going to only intensify as you get closer to the June 20 transition date? So for example, are you seeing even slower trends in base so far? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, I don't think anybody's clipped up anything. They still have to use that co-brand AMEX card through June 19, and nobody can actually use the new card even if you got it in the mail until June 20. That's part of our original agreement with our previous service provider. And that's fine. So all stuff will happen June 20 and beyond. And rest assured there's going to be a lot of stuff happening in terms of our continued communication, of course, to our members, but there's a lot of members out there that don't have chance. About a little over 40% of our US sales were done on AMEX with I think over two-thirds of that, a little over two-thirds to half of that being on the co-branded card. Some people tend to want Delta points or Starwood points, so they are using a different one. The same thing will happen with Visa. Our goal is to get that co-branded card, as we did successfully with the AMEX co-branded card, that to be your top-of-wallet card. We think that there's going to be a lot of things that drive that, including the people out there on blogs independently and others that look at what is currently a 3, 2, 1 is going to be a 4, 3, 2, 1, that's huge. So my personal view is it'll be something that's not going to all hit on day one. Let's get through day one and the transition first, but it'll be something that will continue for a couple to several years. Matt Lasser : Okay. Good luck. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So Rich, do you think this 30 annual openings, is that -- certainly you have the people and the capital to do more. Is it a real estate bottleneck, or you are comfortable at that level? Can you go solidly beyond that? And I think internationally outside of North America as you go into more countries, you would think that there is an opportunity to do 15, 20 a year comfortably. Can you ever get to that level? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, it clearly is not capital; we have plenty of capital. I would argue we have too much capital out there. We like it that way. It's people. It is people. Years ago, I didn't depreciate it as much as I do now, particularly in these countries. If you think about in Japan, I think there was an 18-month period a few years ago where we went from 9 to 20 units in about a year and a half, two years. It's not like we are sending a bunch of experienced warehouse managers to go open and operate and be warehouse managers in Japan from different countries. So you do that a few at the beginning and you may do it occasionally on a onesie basis, but at the end of the day, you are growing from within and developing those local country people. And first and foremost from an international standpoint, you've got that. That can be a little bit of a challenge, and then you've got things take longer there. There are some countries that I understand are very difficult just because of zoning and restrictions that are in place, not just on us, but any big-box, even local company big boxes in the hypermarket area and the like. So it's going to take a little longer there. The other thing -- do I think we can go above 30? Look, we shoot for low 30s and then next year we will shoot for mid-30s and you've certainly heard me say that we want to be around 30 and five years from now we should be doing 35. Maybe we will fall a little short of that, maybe we won't. But we've got more feet on the ground real estate-wise in other countries, as well as the US, than we've ever had. It does take a little longer, but we also -- could we physically open more? Sure, but we like what we do and the way we do it. And probably we also have a comfort level that it's not like we are going to miss out. We are, in our view, the preferred flood out there, and so when we go into a market, if we take a little longer to get there, people are waiting for us. It might be a little harder, but the fact of the matter is is we feel comfortable how we are doing it. John Heinbockel : And then, as the traffic in the US has moderated, back to what -- maybe you said you were at a level that couldn't be sustained, back at a level that can be, are there discussions internally that it is just a natural moderation, or because you talked about within the categories the 16 basis point improvement in margin that there are things you can do proactively to give more back to the member, and would that do anything to traffic? So that discussion internally about the balance of earning versus trying to maybe drive traffic a little more, can that be done? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, first quarter was -- and if you haven't seen this slide before, it's reiterated and put out here internally every day of the year and at our managers meeting, Jim used to and Craig does now, we are a top-line company, we want to drive sales. The fact that margins year-over-year are up on those categories up 16 basis points, we are not smart enough to figure out how to get there all the time. We are always going to drive margin a little bit where we can, but we do it the right way by giving most of any savings back to the customer. If I look at our competitive stance, our pricing competitive stance, versus our direct competitors, the gap has never been wider. We could make a little more of this, but we don't. At the end of the day, we are always looking for ways to do that. When we do membership fee changes, historically, we are always looking to give some of that back. So all of those things go into it. But at the end of the day, what helps margins? Private label, fresh food strength, some of the ancillary businesses. All of those things are helping as well, and again, we feel -- we don't necessarily -- I got to tell you, we don't look at it and say, hey, frequency came down a little bit, or the comp is a new normal or a little bit lower. We want to do more. Even when we were doing a 4% shopping fee, how do we get it higher even though that was kind of tough. So we are going to continue to do things in that direction and we don't necessarily worry about, well, that came down a little bit so we need an extra few basis points of margin. That's never the case around here. John Heinbockel : All right. And then, lastly, is KS having any kind of real impact that you can see on basket size or not really? Richard Galanti : I don't know. We keep adding -- well, we subtract and add KS items, so they live and die by the same metrics. If it's not a great item, we stop it. But there aren't any giant items like toilet paper and water, those types of things or disposable diapers, several years ago, but there are lots of little ones. I think, again, we would see that continue, the increased penetration, but at a slower rate of growth in the future as well for the same reasons. John Heinbockel : Okay, thanks. Richard Galanti : I don't think, getting back to your question, I don't think that's a big reason of why the basket size has changed. If anything, many of those items, it's a lower price point. If we are doing brand only and we brought in the \u2013 prefer [ph] next to it, in many instances, it may be the same because we go to a bigger pack size. In many instances, you've got a lower price point on the same number of units. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Mike Montani : Hey, guys. This is Mike Montani on for Greg. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask, first of all, Richard, you mentioned that there was obviously a little bit of extra strength maybe in some of the discretionary versus nondiscretionary categories and that was something that gave you comfort that the consumer hadn't changed that much. Can you provide any updates -- obviously, early on here, but like from May results so far, have you seen sequential improvement in traffic versus even April trend? Richard Galanti : Well, we really can't talk to anything about May yet. There's no giant surprises in either direction. But, at the end of the day -- and again, the comfort level -- I think I was -- earlier in the call, I was responding to many calls that I received from both institutional investors and analysts out there about the concern. And again, when we look back at it, and we reported April sales and we said, okay, what are the reasons why it came down a bit, was a little weaker. What again gave us comfort, one little data point of comfort, was the fact that some of those discretionary categories are actually doing a little better than one would have thought given the total number. And so that's about as much as I would read into that. Mike Montani : Okay, thank you. Richard Galanti : We will tell you next Wednesday for May. Mike Montani : And if I could, just to follow up on gas a little bit, could you provide the price per gallon for the quarter and also the comp gallon trends and if there was any material impact to EPS that I may have missed? Richard Galanti : The price per gallon was down for the quarter 19.7%, basically $2.59 a year ago and $2.08 this year. And what was the last part? Mike Montani : Just asking about what was the comp gallon percentage change and then also was there any material EPS impact on this quarter and if you could help us size up exactly what we are up against in next quarter? Richard Galanti : I think year-to-date we are up in the low single digits in terms of comp gallons. Again, the big comparison was it was a year ago when it was really outsized comp gallons up 7%, 8%. I know in April I think a year ago it was 8% in the US, and so that was part of that impact of why sales, in our view, sales were a little weaker particularly in California in April. Mike Montani : And just the EPS impact, Richard, I'm sorry, on per gallon\u2026 Richard Galanti : It was within a penny or two, really no change year-over-year. I think it might have been a penny. Mike Montani : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict of Robert Baird. Peter Benedict : Hey, Richard. Thanks for taking the question. One on gas and another on a different subject. You've been adding 20 to 30 gas stations a year the last several years. I think your penetration is like 70% across the clubs. How do we see that going forward, is that pace of growth going to continue? Where do you think you can get the penetration of gas stations call it a few years out? Richard Galanti : Well, in the US -- first of all, every new unit we do where it's possible, we put in a gas station and we are even doing a few in countries like Japan and Australia, which we hadn't done historically. We relocated a few units in the US. We just moved Hackensack to Teterboro. The Hackensack became I think our 11th, 10th or 12th business center and the new Teterboro one is a big new Costco with a gas station, with better parking and great. So if we did three or four -- I don't have it in front of me -- but if we did 4 relos this year, my guess at least 3 of them have gas stations and those three don't. But we are starting to max that out. In the US, we have -- at the end of the quarter, we had 420 gas stations out of 481 warehouses. In Canada, 55 out of 90. I'm guessing in Canada we still have a little bit more room to grow because we started there later. Again, in the UK, we had none a couple years ago, now we have 4. Japan we have 5. Spain, 50% of them, 1 out of 2, and Australia, 5 out of 8 I believe. And so again it's not like five years ago in terms of just adding a bunch of gas stations, but it still, I think, moves the needle a little bit. Peter Benedict : Okay. That's helpful. And then can you take a minute and discuss the senior management ranks at Costco? There's been some turnover lately. Doug, I think his last day may be tomorrow I guess, but just talk about what's going on in terms of transition, future transitions and maybe what changes, if any, these new leaders have implemented. I understand it would be only marginal, but just curious your thoughts on all that? Richard Galanti : Well, look, you talked about shopping frequency staying at 4% for 7 years. People have stayed for 30, including me. So you are having some turnover, of course. Over the last few years, you've had people that are retiring in their early 70s that have worked together starting 55 years ago at FedMart in San Diego. But I think from a merchandising and operations standpoint, that's been well thought out. Let's face it, the first big concern was what's going to happen when Jim leaves. I think while we were comfortable here internally, I think we've shown and certainly Craig has shown that the transition and the maintaining of the culture has continued without missing a beat. In merchandising over the last few years, we've took certain carriers like we used to be with non-foods, which is a combination of hardlines and softlines and Dennis Knapp, who was a senior executive over that and has since retired, we promoted two people and have broken out hardlines and softlines. In operations, we've made several promotions and changes of people again, typically low-tenured people like they've only been here 20 to 25 years that are going from VP to Senior VP levels on -- I think we've got about 16 Senior VPs of Operations in the US geographically. Now in terms of Doug, Doug, as you know, has been head of US merchandising and certainly involved in a lot of merchandising beyond that as well. Doug is great. He's leaving for -- no negative issues both internally or with himself, and we are all kind of jealous. He's more on the younger side of the senior management team. Craig has a plan, but he's looking at a few things and over the next few months, we will be announcing how that changes. But we've got good people in place and we don't think that there's an issue at all there. In Asia, Richard Chang, who goes back to the Price Club days probably 25 plus years ago, ran operations for Taiwan, was promoted as Senior VP over Asia and we've brought some new people in there as well, new people meaning existing Costco people, of course, from the US. And so I think we feel pretty good about the change. It's sped up because it was at zero. In the last couple of years, it's been a few, a couple and now it's a few and a few more. But I think we are pretty well-positioned for that. I don't see a big change in what we do and how we do it. Peter Benedict : Okay, great. Thanks, Richard. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul of Nomura. Bob Drbul : Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more around some of the geographic trends that you are seeing and just update us on your thoughts around the trends in California? Richard Galanti : We pointed out California last month for April because it was -- while US overall again was a little weaker than it had been, it was really California. California is about a third of our US company operations and it's probably a little bit more penetrated gas-wise. And again, a year ago, we had gallon comps, which not only drives gasoline, but more importantly drives people in the parking lot and 52 or 53 of every 100 come into shop. And so that was where we saw a bit of a distortion, California versus the rest of the US. I believe there was a -- I don't have the number in front of me -- but to get to a 1, the other US was at a 2 and California was a minus 1, and I'm off by a little bit there, but it is that kind of direction. And so that was a little unusual. Again, I can't predict what that means for the future, but other than that, there are some markets where -- I think the positive that we see is we've been successful in some of these new medium-size markets. We had the most new sign-ups I believe in many years in terms of a new market, new medium-size market in Tulsa just a few weeks ago. Through opening day, we had more sign-ups than we've had. Now I'm not talking about Asia; that's a whole different story in terms of sign-up levels. So again, things look pretty good. I don't know if there's a lot of geographic changes other than the thing we called out on California. I personally believe a lot of that related to some of the gas issues. Bob Drbul : Got it. I saw that you are doing -- what is it, a pickup truck with GMC in terms of -- and are you getting other vendors that are coming to you to look for marketing opportunities given the success of the business? Richard Galanti : Well, sure. In the car business, I think last year just in the US, we did just under 0.5 million new cars. We've always done -- when car manufacturers have come out with something new, we could do -- by putting one of those cars in front of our trucks in front of each of our locations and doing some type of extra amount of incentive, we can drive a ridiculously large percentage of those six weeks of sales in that car or truck. In this case, we've toyed with the idea for several years and talked to all the manufacturers about doing a KS vehicle. A great vehicle with all the bells and whistles and an even better value than you'd get as a Costco member or as a Costco executive member. So I know we had started and stopped a couple times with a couple different manufacturers. We are pleased with it. We think the manufacture is. The dealers are. And sure there will probably be more in the future, but we will see. Bob Drbul : Great. Thank you very much. Richard Galanti : We back those with auto products too. We just keep bringing it to a different level. Why don't we take two more questions? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Hey, good morning, Richard. Just want to clarify a few things, if you don't mind. First, on the new member sign-ups, I think you said up 15%, certainly international store openings has a lot to do with that, but you are also seeing success in the US. If you can maybe just give us a little bit more detail around what's driving that. Richard Galanti : Well, I don't know what's driving it. We do a pretty good job of getting people in the door, opening in some of these new markets help. It's just been overall strong. If the US is 15% and the whole company is 15%, where was it down? It was up relative to the 15% of course in the end and places like Taiwan and Spain of course was huge, but it's huge on a base of one. And then it was a little lower in Canada where we had very few new openings. And Mexico same thing. Mexico last year we had a huge opening on a base of about 34 or 35 units, a huge opening, which had outsized numbers, so we are comparing against that with no new openings this year, same thing in Canada. We had a huge opening in a location there a year ago in the quarter versus none. Paul Trussell : Got it. And then on core merchandise margins, just wanted to make sure the 16 basis point gain you are referring to, that's kind of the true core merchandise margins on the four categories that compares to the 11 basis points. Is that correct? And then also you made a comment earlier in the call regarding AUR. Is your view of total store deflation around 1%? Richard Galanti : Well, if I look at my LIFO index -- we don't know exactly. If I look at my LIFO index, which is 70% of our inventory, it's a US accounting principle, from the beginning of the year to now, that's about a percentage point, 0.9 of 1%. If I look at the just the total through the US front-end registers, number of items in the basket was up year-over-year 1.4 percentage points, the average basket was up 0.4 percentage points, so a 1.0 percentage point delta there. That again I think just affirms that roughly 1% deflationary number on average. But it's educated art, not complete science here. And the margins, the 16, is on its own sales, each of those categories, by each of those four categories sales. Paul Trussell : Great. Thank you and good luck. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Thanks for getting me at the end here. Richard, can you remind us where you are in the IT modernization investment program, when some of those pressures may start to ease? And secondarily, are there any other investment bubbles we should be mindful of as we think about the next two to three years? Richard Galanti : IT is the gift that keeps on giving. We started at about 3.5, 4 years ago. As we look at it today, what we thought might take four or so years to do the big chunks of this will take six. As we thought it would cost X, it cost 1.5X to 2X, or whatever it is, which is typical. Our guess is that it'll still be slightly detrimental in fiscal '17 and actually technically it may be even flat to improved a little in '17, but you've got a 53-week year, so there is a little cheat there. But generally speaking, flat to up a little in '17, maybe up a little in '18 or flat, maybe down a little. We don't know yet. But we are starting to get to that inflection point and my guess is that inflection point will come sometime towards the end of '17 or into '18. Keep in mind, these numbers don't assume anything -- this is necessity first and foremost. We believe it will help us in different ways, in many ways, and there will be other things we'll add to it. But the bulk of it, of course, is getting behind us and we will go from there. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. And any other incremental expenses that we should be mindful of, like you finish one program and typically there's another one waiting or lurking right behind it? Richard Galanti : I don't think there's anything big out there that way. We just did the bottom of the scale increase, which is a little unusual, not a big number, but it's $0.06 or so a year. And there's no giant changes coming to healthcare. We still give great health, medical, dental and vision benefits to everybody. If we increased the sales penetration outside of the US, certain structural expenses help us. Healthcare in the US is easily 20 to 60 basis points as a percent of sale higher than every other country in the world and so just by doing more elsewhere that'll help that number a little bit, same thing with labor costs. We pay similarly great labor wages relative to whatever in-country norms are, but certainly the numbers in the US and Canada are higher than some of the countries. And so those things will help us a little bit. Now I don't think -- there's nothing huge going on out there that -- I don't think we have any big shocks to the system. Scot Ciccarelli : Got you. Thanks a lot, guys. Richard Galanti : Thank you, guys. We will be around. Have a good day.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Richard Galanti. Please go ahead. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Amanda and good afternoon to everyone. As you know, these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. Today, we reported our fourth quarter and year-to-date fiscal \u201816 operating results for the 16 and 52-week periods ended this past August 28. For the quarter, earnings came in at $1.77 a share, up 2% or $0.04 over last year\u2019s fourth quarter earnings of $1.73 a share. In comparing the year-over-year fourth quarter earnings results a couple of items of note in looking at the comparison. FX as compared to a year ago during the fourth quarter, foreign currencies in the countries and other areas where we operate were weaker overall versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in Mexico, Canada, UK and Korea, this resulting in foreign \u2013 in our foreign earnings in Q4 when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $13 million after tax or $0.03 a share and exchange rates been flat year-over-year. Gasoline profitability. Our profits from gasoline during the quarter as compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter were lower by about $27 million pre-tax or $0.04 a share, primarily a function of last year\u2019s very strong profit results in the fourth quarter. Our numbers were fine this quarter, but we did pretty well last year as well. IT modernization, that was about a $0.02 year-over-year impact. I can go for the detail on that, but that was about $60 million pre-tax or 4 basis points to the \u2013 primarily to the SG&A line. Income taxes. Both this year and last year\u2019s fourth quarter results had several positive \u2013 net positive tax benefits that in the aggregate benefited each of the fourth quarter\u2019s earnings per share figures by $0.05. Excluding those positive tax items, this year\u2019s underlying Q4 tax rate was about 0.06% of a percentage point higher than last year\u2019s. That would have been about $0.02 a share, but again, year-over-year in the quarter, each of those fiscal quarters benefited by about $0.05 a share from positive items. LIFO, this year in the fourth quarter, we reported pre-tax LIFO credit of $31 million. That compares to last year in the fourth quarter of $14 million, so both deflationary, although we have all talked about the increased levels of deflation of recent time. So at year-over-year delta $17 million or about $0.02 a share related to a higher deflation in the LIFO credit in the quarter up by \u2013 higher by that amount. In terms of sales for the fourth quarter, total reported sales were up 2%. Our 16-week reported comparable sales figures were flat year-over-year. Comparable sales were negatively impacted by gas price deflation. That was a little over 200 basis points of impact to the company and by weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, the latter about 1 percentage point of impact to sales. Excluding deflation, the flat U.S. comp sales figure for the fourth quarter would have been plus 2%. The reported Canadian comp figure of plus 2% would have been plus 5% ex-gas and FX and the reported minus 2% other international comp figure, ex these two factors, would have been plus 1%. Total comps were reported as zero for the quarter and again, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 3%. And of course, the plus 3% adjusted figure is still being impacted by a bit of an increased general merchandise deflation outside of gasoline. Openings in Q4, we opened 10 new locations and also completed 1 relo. And for the fiscal year, we opened 29 net new locations. On top of that of 4 relocations I believe 2 of them which were relocated in the old units converted into new business centers. Of the 29 locations, 21 were in the U.S., 2 are in Canada, 2 are in Japan, and 1 each were in UK, Taiwan, Australia and Spain. This afternoon, I will also review with you our membership trends and renewal rates, additional discussion about margin and SG&A, talk about e-commerce and a few other items of note, including an update on our recent switch over to the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. This occurred on June 20 after 6 weeks into the fourth quarter. So, on to the fourth quarter results. Quickly, sales for the fourth quarter were $35.7 billion, up 2% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter sales of $35 billion, again, a flat comp on a reported basis plus 3% excluding gas deflation and FX. The flat comp sales results on a reported basis that consisted of an average transaction decrease of 2.8%. Again, excluding gas and FX deflation \u2013 gas deflation and FX, the average transaction was slightly positive year-over-year and an average shopping frequency increase of right around 2.5%. In terms of sales comparisons by geography, Texas, Bay Area and the Midwest regions within the United States showed the best results. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Canada, Mexico, Spain and the UK. In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, sales for that within food and sundries, overall slightly negative year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Within that though, spirits, sundries and deli came in best. Tobacco was the big negative, of course, as we have talked about that and that was down 21% year-over-year as we continue to see lower sales in that category. If I look at the food and sundries category, that again on a comp basis was slightly negative year-over-year for the quarter. Ex the tobacco department, it was plus 3. And you can see \u2013 continue to see tobacco impacting us into the early spring. Hardlines, overall up mid single-digit. The departments with the strong results were majors, electronics, sporting goods, health and beauty aids, hardware and tires. Within softlines, which was up in the low single-digits, apparel, small electrics and home furnishings were the standouts. Within fresh foods, produce and deli were the strongest of the four departments. Of course, meat has had a lot \u2013 meat and other types of protein had a weakness relative to deflation. In ancillary businesses, hearing aids, pharmacy and optical showed the best results. I had mentioned earlier we have recently seen a little pickup in the level of deflation overall. Some categories in the low to mid single-digits \u2013 in the low to mid single-digit range and several fresh food categories, notably meat and pork and things like that in the 5% to 10% range in some cases. Overall though, we are seeing net increasing deflation, but not in those levels and some non-food levels as well \u2013 non-foods as well. Moving to the line items on the income statement, membership fees, we saw good results for the quarter. Reported were $832 million, up 9 basis points and $47 million or up 6% in dollars versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter. It would \u2013 the $47 million would have been up $50 million if you would adjust it for FX. In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, 90% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide, continuing increasing penetration of executive memberships as well. In terms of number of members at fourth quarter and year end, at year end, we had 36.8 million Gold Star members, up from 36.2 million 16 weeks earlier at the end of the third quarter. Primary Business ticked up to 7.3 million from 7.2 million. Business add-on remained at 3.5 million for a total of 47.6 million member households at Q4 end compared to 16 weeks earlier when it was 46.9 million and including add-on cards in terms of you walking around with a Costco membership card in their wallet, 86.7 million at year end, up from 85.5 million just 16 weeks earlier. In terms of Executive Member sign-ups \u2013 Executive Members, we have of the 47.6 million member households, we have 17.4 million. That was an increase of 370,000 during the 16-week fourth quarter or about 23,000 a week increase. And that\u2019s a combination, of course, of new members signing up as an Executive Member as well as members converting to it. Executive Members now account for a little over a third of our base and a little more than two-thirds of our sales, where Executive Members are offered. In terms of membership renewal rates, we ended the year at 90.3% in the U.S. and Canada. That\u2019s ticked down from 90.4% at the end of Q3. In the first half, it was 90.5%; worldwide, 87.6%, which was the same at Q3 end, ticking down from 87.7% in the previous quarter, again, the second quarter. As I have talked about in the last few quarters, in Canada, we finally, in Q4, saw a reversal of some reductions in renewal rates, which we had anticipated when we converted 1.5 year or so ago to a new program card up there. In that case, the portfolio from American Express wasn\u2019t purchased. So it was really had to start all over and you don\u2019t have as many auto renewals to start with. But that\u2019s quickly changed and we have \u2013 again in Q4, we saw a slight increase in the renewal rate there. A little different reason but the same thing a little bit in the U.S. with having no new sign-ups for the last nine months prior to June 20 as we were switching over on June 20. So overall, pretty much the same and we will see where that goes from here. Regarding membership fees, effective the beginning of this month, we increased membership fee \u2013 annual membership fees by about 10% in three Asia locations Taiwan, Korea and Japan, as well as in Mexico and the UK. On an annual basis and as you know, fee increases hit the membership fee income line over about 23 months based on deferred accounting. For example, the first month, people that are seeing this in September, those are people that originally signed up presumably in September and this is when they renew. People that don\u2019t \u2013 didn\u2019t sign up or aren\u2019t renewing until next March, they will be in March and for 12 months end. So that ends the 23 months overall. That will be about $50 million pretax to the membership income line. I am sure there will be some offset in terms of what we do in terms of competitive pricing and everything. Before continuing down the income statement line items, let me spend a minute updating you on our transition from American Express to Citi Visa in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. As I mentioned this took place on June 20, the beginning of the seventh week into the fiscal fourth quarter. Beginning June 20, we stopped accepting American Express at all U.S. and Puerto Rico Costcos and on costco.com and began accepting all Visa cards, including of course, the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. There was a lot of effort and as you know, there were a few operations glitches during the first few weeks after the cutover. We are now past that and more importantly, the new card is fantastic for our members. In terms of increased cash back rewards, the estimate is about a 40% to 50% improvement in the reward program, which is already previously a very good reward program to the members using the Citi Visa Anywhere card. And it\u2019s also great for us in terms of driving member value and sales over the next years and of course lowering our effective costs of accepting credit and debit cards. In terms of improved cash back member rewards, our former card provided a 3% cash back on gas, 2% on restaurant and travel, and 1% everywhere else, including everywhere at Costco other than the gas. With the new CV\u2019s Anywhere card 3% on gas now is 4%, 2% on restaurant and travel is now at 3% and probably the most significant rewards improvement in terms of the total bucket here is the previous 1% reward on all other Costco purchases doubled from the previous 1% cash back rewards now to 2%. We think this is big and it\u2019s even bigger for our executive members who also are in the 2% reward from us on most Costco purchases. So combined, an executive member using the new card with just a few exceptions will earn 4% back at Costco. We think this is exciting, and we think it will be good for our business over the next several years. Now lastly for all other purchases outside of Costco on the card, it will be \u2013 it will remain at 1% cash back reward. A few basic stats on the new card, approximately 11.4 million American Express co-branded cards, representing about just under 7.5 million accounts were transferred over to Citi during the conversion. Nearly 85% of those cards what we considered active, that is the card had been used for purchases over the previous 60 days. Currently, over 85% of the accounts transferred over have now been activated with Costco. And since June 20 and just the past many weeks, 1.1 million members have applied for the new card and over 730,000 new accounts have been activated or a little over 1 million additional Citi Visa cards in circulation. It\u2019s still early. We launched only 14 weeks ago, but so far, we are beating our initial expectations in terms of conversion, usage and new sign-ups to the card. In terms of gross margin, our reported gross margin was higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter by 28 basis points from \u2013 up from 11.14% a year ago to 11.42%. Let you jot down the normal numbers that I asked you to jot down. With our [ph] four columns, reported and without gas deflation Q3 \u201816 \u2013 in Q3 \u201816 would be the first two columns. The third and fourth columns would both be Q4 \u201816 but then also reported without gas depreciation. The core merchandise in Q3 on a reported basis was higher year-over-year by 16 basis points, but without gas deflation, down 2 basis points year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, up 29 basis points of this \u201816 and again ex gas deflation, up 9 basis points. Ancillary businesses in Q3, plus 9 and plus 4 reported in the gas deflation. And in Q4 \u201816, ancillary businesses reported minus 4 and minus 9 without gas deflation. 2% reward, zero and a plus 2 in Q3 and a minus 2 and a zero in Q4. LIFO, plus 2 and plus 2 and in Q4 \u201816, plus 4 and \u2013 I am sorry, plus 5 and plus 4. Other, in Q3 \u201816, both columns had a plus 7 and Q4, no issue, a zero and zero. So, all told in reporting on a year-over-year basis in Q3 of \u201816 compared to the prior Q3, up 34 basis points on a reported basis and up 13 on ex-gas deflation basis. This year in the fourth quarter of course, you saw the 28 basis point up, that would have been plus 4 ex-gas deflation. I might add that the plus 7 a year ago, that was \u2013 I am sorry in Q3 that was simply a one-time legal settlement that benefited margin [ph]. As you can see overall, again our margin was higher by 28, but without gas, plus 4. The core merchandise component that you see \u2013 that I have just mentioned, the plus 29 or the plus 9 ex-gas deflation, that\u2019s the thing our folks want to start with. Our core gross margins, which is fresh foods \u2013 food, sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percentage of their own sales were higher year-over-year in the quarter by 12 basis points with food and sundries and hardlines showing higher year-over-year gross margins slightly, softlines being about flat year-over-year and fresh foods being ever so slightly down year-over-year. Ancillary and other business gross margins were down 4 basis points, ex-gas deflation, down 9, all a function of lower year-over-year gas prices \u2013 gas profits. And as discussed earlier in the call \u2013 but excluding gas, all other ancillary and other businesses gross margins as a percent of their own sales were up 6 basis points. So margins were fine in the quarter overall. And again, LIFO added 4 basis points to the equation. In terms of SG&A expenses, for the quarter year-over-year, we were up 34 basis points, coming in at 10.34 versus a 10.00 a year ago. And again that 34 \u2013 I will have you jot down a couple of numbers, that 34 ex-gas deflation is a minus 13 or higher by 13, not higher by 84. Again the same four columns, Q3 \u201816 for reported and Q3 \u201816 for without gas and the same two column headings for Q4 \u201816 \u2013 in Q4 \u201816. Operation, core operations, minus 24 basis points and a minus means higher, higher by 28 and 4 basis points in Q3 \u201816 on a reported basis, higher by 8 ex-gas deflation. In the fourth quarter, higher by 24 and higher by 6, central, higher by 6 and higher by 4 in Q3 and then Q4, higher by 9 and higher by 7 ex-gas deflation. Stock compensation, higher by 3 and higher by 2 in the third quarter and higher by 1 and flat in the Q4 columns. Then total, reported in Q3 \u201816 compared to Q3 \u201815 on a reported basis, SG&A was higher by 33, but really higher by 14 ex-gas deflation and the higher by 34 this time was higher by 13 so not that different on looking at it that way. The operations component, the minus 6 core operations ex-gas deflation, that consisted of higher payroll and benefits partly due to the slightly weaker sales and the deflation and particularly in fresh that impacts that number, somewhat offset by a variety of other controls and expense improvements, in particular lower year-over-year bank fees as a result of the Amex Citi Visa switch during the quarter. Central expense was higher year-over-year by 9, 7 ex-gas. Increased IT spending related to modernization that was 4 of those 7 and a couple other basis points higher from a few small legal settlements in the quarter. And again, stock compensation was really not an issue year-over-year. Next on the income statement pre-opening, pretty much in line with openings themselves. Last year, we had $27 million pre-opening expense. This year, it\u2019s $3 million lower or $24 million. Last year in the quarter, we had 13 openings. This year in the quarter, we had 11 and which includes that relo, pretty much in line again with what we had expected \u2013 would expect. All told, operating income in the fourth quarter came in at $1.191 billion which was $35 million higher or 3% higher year-over-year than last year\u2019s $1.156 billion. Below the operating income line, interest expense in the fourth quarter came in at $39 million this year versus $40 million last year, essentially flat year-over-year, essentially the same amount of debt outstanding at the various interest rates. Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $11 million in the quarter, coming in at $29 million versus $40 million a year ago. Actual interest income was higher year-over-year \u2013 I am sorry, was a little lower year-over-year. The big difference was the other category, which was $16 million, primarily various FX transactions. This year in the fourth quarter, if I added up all the various FX, which is marking to market items and FX from foreign exchange contracts, we made about $11 million pre-tax a year ago. It was a little outsized. We made $26 million. That generally fluctuates. Usually, it\u2019s plus or minus $5 million. Sometimes it\u2019s a little more or less. Overall, pre-tax income was higher by 2% or $25 million higher, coming in at $1.181 billion. In terms of taxes, I mentioned that earlier, both fiscal fourth quarters this year and last year each benefited by about $0.05 a share from various positive items. And excluding these items, the normalized rate this year was still up about 0.06% from the year earlier. And again, net income coming in at $779 million for the fiscal quarter was up 2% from a year ago. A quick rundown of some other topics in this afternoon\u2019s release, we have provided you balance sheet information. One thing that is not on the balance sheet that I am always asked about is depreciation and amortization. For the fourth quarter that came in at $408 million and for the entire fiscal year, D&A came in at $1.255 billion. One thing that I will look perhaps a little out on the balance sheet was cash levels and accounts payable and the like. That has to do with modernization and switching our basic accounting platform over and this has been a 2 plus year effort. It was installed and it\u2019s really the platform that allowed the legacy systems will now sit on as we continue to develop them over the next couple of years. Not only was a big effort, it was an expensive effort. But nonetheless, to make sure that we had an extra week at the beginning since this system went in on day 1, we \u2013 anything that was set up in the system, any merchandise or other payables that were set up in our system would be paid in \u2013 during week 1 of the new fiscal year. We prepaid a week early the prior \u2013 up to a week early the prior Friday I believe. And so we paid about $1.7 billion extra in week 52 of this past fiscal year and that\u2019s why you see \u2013 you will see the cash levels down and the payables levels down associated with that. So again, one of the statistics we always share with you is accounts payable as a percent of inventory. Last year, fourth quarter end on a reported basis was 101%. What you will see now it\u2019s 85%, but again, taking out that $1.7 billion, it\u2019s 104%, actually a slight improvement in our payables ratio. And excluding construction payables and other types of non-merchandise payables, last year was an 89%, again on \u2013 what I will call a normalized basis. Assuming we hadn\u2019t prepaid $1.7 billion of payables, the 89% would have been up a couple of percentage points to 91%, so manage \u2013 seem to be managing that okay. In terms of average inventory per warehouse, last year fourth quarter end, it stood at exactly $13 million per warehouse. This year, it came in at just slightly over $12.5 million or about $460,000 lower or 3% lower. And really lower warehouse inventory is pretty much spread across many categories, including the impact of deflation in many of the food and fresh departments as well as electronics. A little bit of it has to do with FX, but most of it is just coming down a little bit on inventory levels. In terms of CapEx, in Q4, we spent approximately $850 million. And for all of fiscal \u201816, we came in right at $2.6 billion. That $2.6 billion by the way compares to $2.4 billion for the prior year fiscal year in \u201815. Our estimate for fiscal \u201817 CapEx is in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion, so about the same level as compared to last year perhaps a little bit higher depends on timing. Next, Costco in line, we are currently in the United States, Canada, UK, Mexico and recently \u2013 more recently launched in three in Taiwan. For the fourth quarter, sales and profits were up year-over-year. Total sales were up 12% in the quarter, 13% ex-FX. And for all of \u201816, 15% reported plus 17% ex-FX. On a comp basis, for the quarter, we were up 10% reported and 11% FX \u2013 11% excluding FX and for the year are 14% and 17%. Next discussion in terms of expansion, as I mentioned, in terms of net new locations this year, we opened 29, that\u2019s up from 23 openings in all of \u201815. This current year we have got in our budget 31 net openings, 34, but 3 of them are relos and so something certainly in the high 20s, but I think something our current best guess is the 31. If you look back over the last couple of years, the 23 we opened in \u201815 that represented about 3.5% square footage growth. In fiscal \u201816, the 29 units, recognizing they tend to be a little bigger and we have also expand a few units, it\u2019s about 4.5% square footage growth. And in \u201817, as soon as we got to 31, that would be in the low to mid-4s as well in terms of percentage of square footage growth. Our planned fiscal \u201817 locations assuming the 31 number would be 17 in the U.S., 7 in Canada and 1 each in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico, France, our first in France and also a unit in Iceland. And both France and Iceland are currently targeted for mid-to-late spring \u2013 late spring this calendar \u201817. And as we know sometimes they may slip, but that\u2019s our best guess at this point. Note again, these are first locations in France and Iceland and we look forward to seeing some of you over there. As of fourth quarter end, total square footage stood at 103.2 million square feet. In terms of common stock repurchases for the fourth quarter, we purchased $131 million worth of stock or 856,000 shares at an average price just over $153 a share. For all of fiscal \u201816, we purchased $477 million of stock. That compares to $493 million in 2015 and $333 million in 2014. In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.45 a share. We increased that this past spring a few months ago. That was 12.5% increase from the prior quarterly and annual rate. So, this year at $0.45 a quarter, this yearly $1.80 a share dividend represents an annual cost to the company of just under $800 million. Next Wednesday, October 5, at 6 :00 p.m. Pacific Time, we will announce our September sales results for the 5-week period ending Sunday, October 2, this coming Sunday. This 5-week period will include 34 selling days in the U.S. and Canada recognizing the closing of your business in the observance of Labor Day in those two countries. Lastly, our fiscal \u201817 first quarter results, for the 12 weeks ending November 20, we will do it as we have done this time, we will report after shortly after the market close on Wednesday, December 7 with the earnings call that afternoon at 2 :00. With that, Amanda, I will turn it back to you for Q&A. Operator : My pleasure. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from John Heinbockel. John Heinbockel : Richard, so let me start with expansion. I think you said 7% in Canada, was that right? Richard Galanti : Yes. John Heinbockel : So, kind of \u2013 which I don\u2019t none in recent years have you opened that many in Canada, so what sort of drove that some unique real estate opportunities? Does cannibalization pick up over the next year in Canada? And then sort of tying it back to the U.S., when you think about where you sit today, have you really done any deeper thinking about what the saturation level in the U.S. could be beyond where we sit today? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, in Canada, I think it\u2019s a couple of reasons. If you think back 5 or so years ago or even 10 years ago when we had probably 65, 70 units, we thought the market might be 91 day and today we have 90 or 91 and we think that they will certainly be over 100 and we keep adding a few to that concept. I think the fact that we are opening so many right now has to do with as much with very strong sales over the last few years. We have been enjoying 5% to 9% comps in local currency in each of the last few years up there and so it keeps getting stronger. And just like in the U.S. and even in mature markets, we find that we can \u2013 while there will be some cannibalization, the net business that\u2019s added when we opened a unit even though it\u2019s cannibalizing, net of cannibalization will find that existing members will then be shopping more frequently, because they are closer. And so I think it\u2019s a combination of those things. And I don\u2019t know what the new 5 or 10-year guesstimate is in Canada. I don\u2019t think we can open 7 a year, but once we decided to go to look and see where we are going and how strong we have been, we have been \u2013 this is the result of probably an effort that started over a year ago to put a few more in the pipeline up there. In terms of the U.S., I think the same story holds true If you had ask us 5 years or so years ago, by now how many would be in the U.S. versus outside the U.S. and we would have said probably we would be down from 75% or 80% in the U.S. to 50% and heading south of there is we saturate. We found in the U.S. that we can put more units in existing markets. I think we are getting, in a couple of months, we are getting ready to open our 17th or so unit in the Puget Sound, having opened our 16 or unit just less than a year ago. And the other thing of course, in the U.S. that we have perhaps up to our expectation is markets that 5 years or so years ago we didn\u2019t think we would have any near-term interest in considering medium sized markets where our direct competition was there. And what we have found is we have done pretty well when we go to these markets. Now some of these markets are smaller, it takes a little longer, but there is clearly an opportunity for us there and as we have gone into Tulsa and New Orleans and Birmingham and Rochester and lots of \u2013 and Toledo, these are markets that again, were higher on the radar 7 years or 8 years ago. And what we have seen is that our deal works. The last thing of course, includes adding to some of the business centers. For many years we only had six or eight or so business centers. We opened four last year to be at 11 and we are planning to open four this year to be at 15 including our first business center in Canada. And so again, that just adds a few in both the Canada question and the U.S. question. It includes that opportunity on a small basis. And a side on that is, I think as I have mentioned, I think two of the four relos this year were \u2013 two of the four business center openings this year were relos. One in back in many of your [indiscernible] when we took an older, smaller parking lot, no gas station, Hackensack Costco and relocated it to Teterboro nearby with the big sized unit with lots of great parking, great ingress in the U.S. and a gas station and converted the Hackensack unit into the business center, so just a small additional benefit in terms of having a use for units as we moved some of those to bigger locations. So all that\u2019s I think been part of it. John Heinbockel : Alright. And then just lastly, have you sort of finalized or thought about the percentage of the Amex to Visa benefit that you are going to get, how much you keep versus providing that back to members, when you think about putting it back to members, when you think about price, labor and/or service and then maybe product development, where is the most lucrative place to reinvest and I am not \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it would be price, but is it something like product development and pushing the envelope outlook more in Kirkland? Richard Galanti : Well, some of those things that you threw out is possible ways to use that parts of this bucket of money. We do all of those anyway. And I think probably the best, simplest answer is that just like when we buy a physical product better lower we can buy whether it\u2019s lower freight, greater purchasing power or greater production efficiencies or whatever we figure out with our supplier, we generally wanted 80% or 90% of that, the vast majority of it given back to the customer in terms of lower price because that\u2019s what drives us and drives our business. And if we do it more next year, we will give 80% or 90% of that back. It\u2019s not an exact number, but it\u2019s well closer to 80% or 90%. That same MO and philosophy occurred here. So when we sat down and negotiated all the various levers that relate what I call this bucket of money, there is a lot of ways one can use it, most importantly by improving the reward on the cards to the member that\u2019s going to utilize it. That will drive value to that member and loyalty to us and also more business to us. And secondly, what\u2019s left over and when we originally did it, we did it such that we are going to keep a small amount of it. Now, to the extent \u2013 we are not going to change the rewards program every afternoon if we see that there is more money in the bucket. So that will additionally accrue to us, but it\u2019s not changing what you are doing with it. We are going to still do those other things. So again I think over time, you look at it and you can rest assured in a few years if the success of the card and the economics of the card to us, we are not going to allow ourselves to keep a lot of that extra, but we started with a small amount and the big bucket is good and it is a little better because the card is working in direction that we expected, that\u2019s good. And we are still going to do those other things anyway. John Heinbockel : Okay, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Simeon Gutman. Morgan Stanley Simeon Gutman : Thanks guys. Simeon Gutman. Richard, thinking about the top line, we are on the verge of cycling, I would say some of the worst of food deflation, I know you mentioned it\u2019s picking up a little and then some of the traffic that the business got on the gas side and I think the tobacco headwinds you mentioned is still a little more to go and first, is that fair that we are on the verge of cycling that. And then if we are, should we expect to pickup in the business from a top line, are expecting a pickup, I am just curious how you are thinking about that? Richard Galanti : What was the last part of the question, Simeon? Simeon Gutman : I mean, should we see the business in flat from the top line as some of these, I guess deflation top line headwind debate? Richard Galanti : Yes. Well I think first of all, I think first of all there is \u2013 first one, when I asked different buyers and different merchandise categories, their view is it\u2019s going to be three months to six more months. Recognizing these are also gasses, I mean they are perhaps educated, unless you know there is something specifically happening like you are anniversary-ing the bird flu or your anniversary-ing really high feed prices on the commodity side. Sometimes there is a little more predictability on that side. But beyond that, I would say probably best guess is five months or six months of continued deflation at these newer levels in some cases. Gas, who the heck knows. Simeon Gutman : Are there any changes there? Richard Galanti : Yes. Bob is here. Barring any major changes out there, you would see an inflection point probably in. More neutralism. Simeon Gutman : Late fall. Richard Galanti : Late fall, so it\u2019s a few months. That sounds like a definite maybe. Simeon Gutman : If you \u2013 I guess if you take the deflation in the food categories, if you take some of the deflation, maybe in electronics or do this analysis of looking at the units versus the sales, I guess what is that delta if you put it altogether, like your best guess at that? Richard Galanti : I have to get back to you on that and I will give you some sound points, if you will. Some of it, I mean there are so many examples particularly like in meat. You have seen every month at the budget meeting where we will have literally a 10 or so percentage point dropped in the price per pound and a 4 or 5 \u2013 3% or 4% or 5% increase in labor productivity per pound and less efficiency because of the fact that the price per pound went down much more than that. And so that\u2019s the kind of stuff that hits your profitability, of course too. There is \u2013 if I look at \u2013 there is some interesting things going on with some commodities. I was just looking at a chart coffee, the average \u2013 these are average sales but it\u2019s consistent with average cost, down 16%. A lot of things, in the certain \u2013 cheeses are down 10% to 20%. I believe eggs are way down right now. And so those things are all impacting you. Now it impacts you on selling eggs, it helps you a little bit in selling muffins because we are obviously changing 6 impact a month and from making the numbers. We sold them for but $5.99 down 5$.89. And so you are going to \u2013 I would say the net of those twos is still a detriment to us. By the way, what I mentioned earlier about late fall, that had to do specifically with gas. We will see the inflection point, it looks like we are going to see an inflection point with gas all things being equal out there in the next couple of months. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then my follow-up is related to the credit card, I guess looking back, you only had a couple of months, but are there signs that there was some deferred spending on either big ticket items. And then if you have the data, is the same member who is either buying on AMEX or not on the co-branded card, is their spending up individually year-over-year, meaning they are incented by the card and they are actually spending more with you? Richard Galanti : As it relates to the first question, absolutely. We probably saw it biggest and something that the millennials don\u2019t buy, affiliates. We saw a big decline for a few weeks leading up to it and big increase right afterwards. Also, on big ticket, but generally speaking, jokes aside on millennials, across the board we saw improving bigger ticket purchases, which again that make sense, people are waiting. Now there is all types of movement in both directions. You had existing \u2013 a member with existing Visa cards in his or her wallet and maybe they are using that one, not ours, that\u2019s fine. We still have a negotiated good rate on certain things. You have people that were using debit their whole lives because they perhaps did not want an American Express card or they applied for one and did not get one. And so for 16 years, they used cash, check and debit. Now, for the first time, they can use a credit card and I am sure that\u2019s where we saw many of these new signups as well or part of them, but in terms of are they buying more with us? Anecdotally, we are hearing that from our warehouse managers who talk with their biggest wholesale customers, but it\u2019s purely anecdotal at this juncture and I think we will see more of it. I haven\u2019t actually looked any statistics on that. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks, Richard. Operator : And your next question comes from Matt Fassler. Matt Fassler : Good afternoon, Richard. Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Couple of questions. First of all, you spoke in fairly general terms about how you plan to make use of the better economics of the credit card where we hoped to direct it. If you think about the impact on the P&L this quarter along with launch, I don\u2019t know if there are special provisions in place for the cost of launch in the card. I am not sure if there are elements of the change of the arrangement that started to impact it, but would you say that there is any offset to SG&A or meaningful offset to gross margin that resulted from the transition this quarter? Richard Galanti : Well, certainly there is certain costs were subsidized in the transition from our partners. But at the end of the day, there \u2013 yes, I mentioned I think when I was going through the SG&A, payroll and benefits for our company, were up year-over-year in the quarter in SG&A. And that was somewhat offset by and I said in particular, rounded up into anything related to this credit card transition. So, yes, there is improvement related to that. Matt Fassler : Got it. And then second question, if you think about other international, obviously you didn\u2019t call out Asia, any of the Asian countries as strong countries, You spoke in over the course of the month it releases about comping some of the big openings that you had in recent years and the other international comp number is a bit lower than we have typically seen anything to think about the franchise in those markets or the macro or how you are resonating in that part of the world? Richard Galanti : No, it has more I think to do with a little bit of cannibalization in a couple of those countries where you have got 10 or 12 locations in Korea and Taiwan or I think we had a cannibalization in Australia as well, but one location take a $200 million or $300 million building down $70 million, $80 million and that\u2019s what\u2019s in your comp, not the new building. So, that has much to do with it as anything. We feel really good about our markets. We feel very good. And as we have said, the one market that has been \u2013 we start, we remind ourselves that there is a time when we were going to close Korea and Taiwan and they are our most and almost our most profitable productive countries and locations. And we have talked about our first unit in Syria [ph], got off to a slow start. It\u2019s growing nicely now. Madrid got off to a much better start and it\u2019s growing nicely. And so, again, we are patient, but in terms of that other international comp number, I would guess and I don\u2019t have the detail in front of me, but what I have seen before is in recent times is that it\u2019s cannibalization more than anything. Matt Fassler : And that\u2019s good to hear on Spain by the way. If you think about the cadence of openings and year ago openings and where the new stores are going to open in some of those markets, is this an issue, the cannibalization issue that should stay with you for a little while or is it that to abate at some point over the course of the fiscal year? Richard Galanti : Which one? Matt Fassler : The cannibalization primarily in Asia, presumably. Richard Galanti : I hope it doesn\u2019t abate. That means we are working hard to get more openings there. These are generally no-brainer locations in terms of very predictable successful locations for us. We feel we have developed a great franchise over there with great loyalty and great success and we would like to do it a little more if we can. We are working hard to get more locations in both Korea and Taiwan as an example. And it just takes a long time in Taiwan and longer than a long time in Korea because of zoning and other restrictions and it rains on everybody and other big boxes in those community \u2013 in those areas have the same impact. Matt Fassler : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : And your next question comes from Michael Lasser. Michael Lasser : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Richard, are you seeing any evidence that you are attracting new members to your club as a result of the more lucrative credit card offer? Richard Galanti : Yes. And again, this is very early. We have seen in the tens of thousands of signups or people that were members that signed up because of activities in Citi branches and bank branches. And we have seen from the blogs, of course, the first few weeks of the blogs always saw, was about the 30 minute waiting times or longer and other hassles like that. But the reality is we have seen, I would say, it\u2019s still a small percentage, what I mentioned there was 703,000 new accounts, I would guess well less than 100,000, but 50,000 to 100,000, I am guessing, would be that. A lot of it has to do with existing members that we are seeing the value of that card when they walk in. Michael Lasser : And do you have any plans to try and accelerate the sign-up of new members by raising awareness of the card through marketing effort? Richard Galanti : We are doing that already. But maybe we are not doing a good enough job. But there is nothing else that we are doing right now and when I say that to our partners as well, because they are doing some things as well, but we are getting the word out in a big way in the warehouse with handouts, with signage, with people, the word is getting out. And we are, again, as I mentioned earlier, we are beating our own expectations of what we had planned for these initial 14 weeks, if you will. And so we feel pretty good about it. Michael Lasser : And my follow-up question is so you are beating your expectations on the credit card overall, you mentioned that spending for maybe some of your larger customers on the card has been a little bit better and may pickup as a result of it. Yet, your overall columns have been a little more sluggish in the last couple of months. Does it actually suggest that you are seeing even though that marginal customer \u2013 that marginal member go away or some other behavioral change that was driving business model? Richard Galanti : Yes, it\u2019s really hard to tell. I mean, arguably, there is probably 50 different factors that impact sales everyday and every week and every month. And we look at \u2013 try to look at the big picture here. We feel very good about what we are doing in merchandising wise. We feel very good about what we have seen with the crossover to this. Our view has been we don\u2019t think that many people left Costco, because they can\u2019t use their American Express card. American Express is a great brand and it was a great relationship for many years. But at the end of the day, they are coming to Costco because of our quality in our value. And when we look around and as you would well know, we get a lot of questions all the time, well, are we impacted by the Internet, losing some? The internet is taking from everybody. Our view is it takes a little less from us. And interestingly, when you look at the categories within our slightly lower sales over the last couple of few months, the categories that have buffed that trend have been discretionary nonfood categories like apparel and housewares and electronics. So, now when we look at food and sundries, we absolutely do not believe its delivery services. We do absolutely believe its deflation more than anything. But again, everybody takes a little piece of something. It\u2019s a little piece that we would rather have ourselves or not lose. But again, we feel good about what initiatives we have got going on. And again, when I talk about the new card being a reward to the member based on their previous spending habits, 40% to 50% greater reward, that\u2019s big. When I talk about going from 1% to 2% on Costco purchases when they use that card, that\u2019s big and it\u2019s not big overnight where they just change their habits completely. You will see at first in business members and that\u2019s where we have seen it. Mind you, during the transition, there was probably a little loss of sales for some of those business members in some cases. I am sure American Express didn\u2019t around not doing anything. They are good at what they do and they were able to figure out how to get people, they are marketing elsewhere. But we think that our members at Costco, primarily for us, I think again it\u2019s a lot of different things or different factors and again, having gone to our budget meeting forever but having gone every four weeks, just to name with the last few, some of the initiatives I see going on, merchandising wise, I think we got a lot of good things going on. Not that we are trying to solve a problem from yesterday, it\u2019s what we do everyday. Michael Lasser : Thanks so much. Operator : And your next question comes from Dan Binder. Dan Binder : Hi. It\u2019s Dan Binder. Thanks. Just following on here, your comment about the web taking a little bit from everybody, does that change the way you think about your own web strategy, type of items you are willing to put on and delivery times, etcetera just to create greater convenience because price doesn\u2019t really show up on our screen as the major factor? Richard Galanti : Well first of all, I don\u2019t see us \u2013 yes, we are doing some things anyway and are we doing more things, absolutely. But we are not freaking out about it. We are recognizing \u2013 we recognized that we are not going to be the provider. We may be the provider to somebody that wants to deliver like an Instacart or Google Express, but we are not going to be dropping off small items and our prices at your doorstep. That being said, we are, we have and we continue to add things. On the merchandise initiative side, we have added various sundries items and health and beauty items and on the apparel, trying to get to a more treasure hunt. I think you are going to see big differences literally in the next several weeks of the types of hot items that you see on there on the non-food side in the treasure hunt. On the \u2013 I think that\u2019s probably the biggest thing you will see. Operationally, there is a few things. We are by no means, we are one click. We recognize our site has had some challenges. You are going to see in the next few months a big improvement in the number of clicks. You are going to see in the next six months or eight months, some big improvement on search. You are getting much streamlined returns process. We have never been big on convenience. Our success has been based on pricing value, quality and quantity at the lowest possible price. We do appreciate that value also is convenience. We are going to greatly improve what we do, but it doesn\u2019t mean we are going to get something to you in tow hours. And I think again though, when I look at some of the things that we are doing internally, I am not trying be cute here, but there is something I can\u2019t talk about yet. You will see some differences and mostly the differences are from an offensive standpoint, not a defensive standpoint. But we look at our core business of getting you in the store still is paramount to what we want to do. Dan Binder : And then if I heard the numbers correctly, it sounds like the growth rate slowed a little bit this quarter on .com, any particular callouts in terms of merchandise that was offered this year, not last year or any particular categories that are slower? Richard Galanti : I wasn\u2019t going to bring that up only because I don\u2019t want to sound defensive. But there were two things last year in electronics that were big. The iPhone 6 launch last year was huge and the iPhone 7 launch was not as huge. And the other thing is last year was, the introduction of the Windows 10 and there are two things. Prior to a year ago comparison, a few months prior to that, people were waiting for the Windows 10 launch and so you had a lot of pent-up demand and the launch itself and compared to a year later. So those two things alone were part of that. That\u2019s frankly I think one of the bigger things. But again, I think as I have said jokingly, have seriously and have jokingly in the past, some of the things that we haven\u2019t done historically gives us the great opportunity to do these. And there are still some blocking and tackling like couple of things that I just mentioned. We have greatly improved our delivery, but it was from bad to better. It still takes too long and again, we are not going to get something to you in two hours. But you can see some logistically some things. And then on handling returns, particularly big ticket returns, we haven\u2019t done a good job of that and that\u2019s already in process. So you will see some changes that will help. The biggest thing though is going to be the merchandise initiatives. And again I think, you are going to see, we have added items and we are adding some items but we are not trying to figure out what 20,000 additional items because that\u2019s not what we are going to do. But there will be velocity items or repetitive items in the sundries area as well. And you are right, when you look on your radar screen price is not way up there. But I challenge anybody on the call to compare the exact branded items and a big basket of them not just an occasional loss leader or some retailer or .com may have out there, you are going to see yes, it is a lot of savings here, but you will be shocked how much savings. And again, we recognize also we have got to move a little direction and we are doing that. Dan Binder : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Karen Short. Barclays Karen Short : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess it\u2019s hard to put there my name in general. But I was just curious, on the gas impact, you gave the $0.02 impact, but I was wondering if you could give us some color on how much of that was gas margin versus maybe weaker gallon comps in light of fuel prices being down. And then I am wondering, as price per gallon increases, I am thinking it should obviously help traffic, is that fair, is there anything else to consider in terms of state of the consumer and the competitive landscape? And then I have a follow-up. Richard Galanti : Well, the gas was $0.04. So last year, we had very strong gas prices, no worries. The year earlier in Q4, we had very strong gas profits. So that\u2019s why a year ago, we didn\u2019t really talk a lot about. This year, we actually beat our own internal budget by a little \u2013 a little from the beginning of the year, but again it was $0.04 lower this year, $0.04 this year than it was in Q4 a year ago. Generally, when prices go down, while it impacts some of these basis point percentage calculations, we make more money. When it goes up, we make a little less money although I would say, for the last couple of years, there has been a new normal. When prices went down, our view is as retail gas, overall, they would lower their prices but not as much as they could have. And we lowered it more than that and we are still able to benefit a little from it. So that was a positive. I think yes, it\u2019s the value proposition more than anything that gets people in our parking lot. And we are helped by the gas buddies out by .coms out there, the 2 years they have done it. And then the 4% rebate. There is a lot of different promotional things at the majors out there whether it\u2019s $0.10 a gallon off, 4% is big. As the price per gallon goes up, 4% gets bigger. And so I think that will be positive for us as well. But if you have been through our gas stations, when you have got, in some cases, 20 pumps now pumping at the same time and the lines move fast but there will be six people in each line. That not only drives the success of the gas business, but 51 or so of those people for every hundred come in and even if one them is incremental, that\u2019s good for us. Karen Short : And so can you give us some color on what gallon comps were doing this quarter? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t know if we do that, but I know that it continues to be higher than the U.S. average. And my guess, I will get back to the answer in a minute, somebody is looking up for me. I believe it\u2019s in the mid-singles. It\u2019s in the mid-singles unless I say otherwise. Karen Short : Okay. And then just to clarify on your comments on deflation, I know you were talking that deflation ensued and then there was also deflation I guess in fuel, so you had said that fuel prices should start to rebound in late fall, but deflation in food, are you just to clarify five months or six more months in deflation in food is that what you are trying to say? Richard Galanti : That\u2019s our best guess. Talking to the buyers, that\u2019s our best guess. Karen Short : And any \u2013 can you call it any categories in particular? Richard Galanti : Well, the biggest ones would be protein. And you have got some other things, I was looking at my sheets here, hold on a second and this was just year-over-year, this past month. Walnuts were down 47%. That\u2019s our sell price. And I am sorry, that\u2019s our cost. Now a year ago, they had doubled from the prior year. So they were kind of back where they were, almonds down 38%, whole eggs, down 54%, large eggs, down 53%. I am just looking down the sheet of the top 50 items. So those things, particularly things like eggs really add up. On the inflation page, just for fun, nothing. Well I mean, there are some 20s and 30s, but if I look at the top 25 or so items, just in the last four weeks of the fiscal year, regular unleaded gasoline was down 12.8%. And it was over $3.5 million of credit, if you will, to LIFO. We don\u2019t book it every month like that, but that would have been $3 million. So, the biggest items on the deflation sheet add to the LIFO credit of $2 million to $3.5 million, $2 million to $4 million. The biggest items on the inflationary sheet at $300,000 to $500,000 of LIFO charge. So again, it gives you a sense of where it\u2019s going. Again, another data point is the U.S. inventories at LIFO, that\u2019s an U.S. accounting concept. That was in the indices where you start off for costs on the exact items at the beginning of the fiscal \u201816 at 100.00 and was to go to. Food was down 2.25% with half of that, about 0.5% being just in the last couple of months. Sundries was about down at less than 0.5% and not terribly changed in the last 3 months. Apparel, almost right at the same 100.00 a year ago, almost right there. Computers, I expect down little under 2%. So, it\u2019s all over the board. Again, so you have extreme categories like meat which is high volume, but meat is also, we turn it so much faster. It has a higher churn. It turns, I would think, more than 52x a year where if you have \u2013 that\u2019s a deflationary item. If you have an inflationary item that is turning 8 times in nonfoods, that\u2019s going to be a different story. That\u2019s how it impacts the business. Karen Short : Any color on produce? That was one category you had mentioned. Richard Galanti : I didn\u2019t have that in front of me. It was not as big. I would guess I think it was in the 3 to \u2013 low to mid-singles, back yes. Karen Short : Inflationary or deflationary? Richard Galanti : I am sorry it was up a little inflationary in the last few weeks. Karen Short : Got it, okay. Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question comes from Paul Trussell. Paul Trussell : Hey, good afternoon, Richard. First, just wanted to ask is there anything you have seen from Sam\u2019s Club or BJ\u2019s or other competition whether it\u2019s on price or membership that you felt like you needed to react to? And then second look I know it\u2019s been, I don\u2019t know, 6 or 7 years since you have given guidance but we are moving into a new fiscal year. And just big picture, wanted to know if there is anything you can highlight that we should keep an eye on as we model out whether it\u2019s traffic, comps, thoughts on LIFO, IT spend, payroll, any help would be nice? Richard Galanti : First of all, as it relates to competitive reaction, the answer is really no. I mean, we do that for living daily and weekly and they do it literally to their weekly comp shops in every market with direct warehouse club competition. And certainly in the fresh foods, people do more direct pricing competition on sale items at supermarkets, particularly on holiday week and some things like that and soda pop. But at the end of the day, if anything, our view is \u2013 the mode has continued to get bigger, in other words, our competitive position, pricing wise, is stronger than it\u2019s ever been. But we are not resting on that. We are constantly trying to figure out how to widen it. That\u2019s what we do. As it relates to guidance, we don\u2019t give guidance. The points of headwinds and tailwinds and anniversary of headwinds and tailwinds, things that I have talked \u2013 we talked about in the past we are hopeful that just from a simple FX standpoint, for 2 plus years now, the dollar has strengthened year-over-year. So, it was more than a 1 year anniversary. There was an inflection point of late although nobody knows what tomorrow brings on that. But it looks like it won\u2019t be as impactful to the negative. We got through the headwind of the conversion. That should be a net positive, but I think it will be net positive over the next few years and probably not easily calculable, but we will figure that and we will try to figure that out. We know that will improve our SG&A component of what I will merchant and bank fees, in other words, things related to the new card offering. And again, we will be more quantitative as we get to the next couple of quarters. And it\u2019s more definable than just for 14 weeks. But again, it\u2019s good and we look forward to doing that. I mentioned the international membership fee increases in those certain areas. And that\u2019s, again, that will improve over nearly 2-year period by about $50 million pre-tax of the membership fee line. I imagine you will see some of that offset on some of the margin line. Although not \u2013 to be more competitive, but not reacting to the competition. I am trying to think other things. Gas, again, I think there is a new role in gas. I don\u2019t think there is going to be swings from time-to-time, but I don\u2019t think we are planning anything big. I think the other issue is as we have and some of you heard this before, we have lots of little things that are positive for us that continue to drive value whether it\u2019s pharmacy, optical, hearing aid or whether it\u2019s Costco travel. These are all things \u2013 these are all \u2013 our ticketing program in the warehouse, a new program which is brand new. We are just testing it in Southern California, with Ticketmaster. You can go to costcotickets.com and check it out. But again, some real savings on high end stuff and so there is a lot of things we are doing. We seem to have gotten some breakthroughs on the cosmetic side with SK-II. We hope that brings on others, but very clearly given some of the challenges that brick-and-mortar in that area are impacted by, we could sell the heck out of that stuff and provide great value to our members. And it\u2019s the kind of member we believe that these manufacturers want. Now talking to myself, I have talked myself into it we have got to talk them into it. In terms of gas stations, we continue to add gas stations and hearing aids not just to new locations, but to existing locations. I would say all those things help a little bit. Hello? Paul Trussell : And then just lastly on IT modernization spending for this upcoming year? Richard Galanti : Yes. Look, we will still have an impact as it hits the SG&A this year and probably into next year. I see pushing it out a year. I guess, the amount I push it out keeps getting shorter. It used to be a couple of years I push it out and then a year and hopefully every 6 months, but we are seeing deliverables. We are seeing lights at the end of the tunnel. Our single biggest, most expensive piece, which is the platform on which all the legacy buying systems and transportation systems is there in the process of being rewritten and improved. And I think you will get some real savings from some of those things. I know you will. And the first order of business is getting this in place. And so these are big chunks, but I know I can tell you when that inflection point was going to be. Couple of years ago, let\u2019s say, at the end of \u201814, I would guess that some time in late \u201816 early \u201817. Today, I would say some time in \u201818, probably. And if it is a little longer, it\u2019s because we have got more things that we are doing, not because anything screwed up. We have already gotten past a lot of the scrubber. We know we are spending money on and we are seeing some deliverables and there is more to do. Paul Trussell : Thanks for the color, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from Sean Naughton. Sean Naughton : Yes. Just continuing on the merchandise trends, you were going over some of these things, you didn\u2019t mention organic food, just curious kind of how that\u2019s still performing for you, I know that\u2019s been a good growth driver, I think it\u2019s a margin enhancer? Are you seeing tightness in supply? Are we experiencing the some sort of deflation in that category as you saw in the rest of the food across the store, any commentary there on where that\u2019s going? Richard Galanti : Thank you for reminding me. No, I didn\u2019t call you to remind me. We expect organic to be up 20% this year. Now, some of that will be some cannibalizing of some traditional, conventional, but no, it\u2019s the perfect items for us, because it\u2019s our member. It helps us with millennials on top of that. We get that. It creates a bigger competitive pricing mode, because we have as good, if not better quality at much better pricing. In terms of supply, I think the supply is starting to catch up with the demand out there and I think that some of the \u2013 you have heard me talk in the past about many of our global sourcing initiatives, I think that\u2019s going to continue to help us and make it more competitively advantageous to us. We have long-term relationships that we have had for a while now and have continued to build and there is going to be pockets of supply issues on different items sometimes, but overall, we are doing a lot in that regard ourselves whether it\u2019s produce, with farmers, seafood, poultries, you name it. Sean Naughton : Okay, great. And then just another question just I think this is on a lot of people\u2019s minds just on the membership fee increase potential here in the U.S. or Canada where I think were close to the 5-year anniversary mark. I think this is something that\u2019s \u2013 I know there is no schedule, but typically done every 5 to 6 years. Can you just update us just on your thought process there with respect to MFI in the U.S.? Richard Galanti : It will be U.S. and Canada. We will say we can\u2019t say anything or give any direction on it other than you are right, every 5 or 6 years, we have done something. I think the exact fifth anniversary in the last time would be this January and the sixth anniversary will be the following January \u2013 this November and the next November will be the sixth anniversary. Early this year, we have simply just said is we are going to get through the credit card conversion first, which we have now done. And the only other comments I have made in the past is that when we look at our member loyalty, the impact the previous increases had on renewal rates and anything like that, it\u2019s really a non-issue. And when we do it, we of course use it to be more competitive. So, it becomes a few year benefit not a one-time benefit. And but that all being said, we will let you know when we know. We haven\u2019t made any decisions yet and we haven\u2019t talked about it a lot internally. We actually tell you when we do things. Sean Naughton : Yes, real quick. Just the $50 million pre-tax on the international price hike that you did in a number of markets, that\u2019s over the 23 or 24 months, is that correct, right? Richard Galanti : That would also be over 23 months starting in January \u2013 I am sorry, starting in September now. Sean Naughton : Thank you. Richard Galanti : Sure. Operator : And your next question comes from Greg Melich. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. I have a couple of questions. I just wanted to make sure I understood the dynamics of the new people signing up for the card. So, it was 730,000 new signups in just a couple of months. Richard Galanti : New accounts. Greg Melich : Right. Of new accounts. And so now that you are getting the payments for signing those people up, in terms of the SG&A, core ops may have delevered 6 basis points, but that\u2019s where the benefit of those signups would have showed, so that the payroll may have de-leveraged 10 or 12 and then that gave you some net, is that \u2013 am I thinking about that the right way? Richard Galanti : Yes. Although, I believe again there is different pieces, I would get it all pretty just straightforward and simple, what is our effective merchant fee. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t all go into the SG&A line. There are certain items that benefit sales. I believe Bounty is one of them. So, Bounty goes to sales, which improves your margin a little bit. So, that might be a couple of basis points in there. I haven\u2019t calculated it out. But yes, some of the offset, again, we are talking a small piece of a big bucket is still decent to us, but we are only in it for a few months. Greg Melich : Got it. And the headwinds from payroll, was how much of that was related to some of the weight? Richard Galanti : Yes, we do. It reaches the top of the scale every year. Every 3 years, we announce what it\u2019s going to be to our employees for the next three Marches. This past March we also in the U.S. and Canada raised the bottom of scale by $1.50. So, $11 50 went to \u2013 $11 went to $12.50 \u2013 no, $11.50 went to $13 and $12 went to $13.50. Just that piece, the $1.50 at the bottom scale was I believe $39 million a year, we get 40 \u2013 call it $40 million a year. That would be March to March, so through the early weeks of Q3 \u2013 through the first month of Q3. Greg Melich : That\u2019s great. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess lastly and sort of thinking about how the card is being used, I know you said it\u2019s better than your expectations. I guess could you give us a little more color there especially with the people that are new to the card, right, new to Costco with it as to how much the card is being used outside of the club now that people have that? Richard Galanti : I will be able to give more color on that in the next quarter. What I can tell you is one of the assumptions going into this we want this card just like we wanted our previous co-brand card to be our members top of wallet card. They are not only using it here, they are using it everywhere. The fact that historically I could not use my other card, in my case, my local drycleaner or my little local restaurant, if it is your top of wallet, there are more places you can use it. That grows that small merchant whoever card is being used at that small merchant, they pay a higher merchant fee. There is this whole equation of co-branding and revenue share helps us. And so I believe we are already above what we were on the old card in terms of outside to inside spend. It\u2019s higher than it was after growing, increasing it over a period of time, but we would have expected that. We certainly hoped it, but we have expected it. I don\u2019t think we necessarily knew what to expect to start with and we probably are little pleasantly surprised that it\u2019s already over that amount. And I think it will continue to grow. Yes, I mean, Bob was familiar that we cannot jump to conclusions on this. It\u2019s all 14 weeks old. And as it relates to new people that signed up, again, it\u2019s in the tens of thousands out of that 730,000, it\u2019s not 100,000, it\u2019s not 200,000. And I actually haven\u2019t even looked at the data on those. So, another good comment that Bob is making, it\u2019s been 14 weeks, some of them signed up last week or 2 weeks ago, I guess. Greg Melich : One last housekeeping you said membership fee income was up 6% in U.S. dollar terms? Richard Galanti : Yes. Greg Melich : What was it up in local currency? Richard Galanti : I believe it was the same. It was $47 million versus $50 million, but it is the same percentage increase. Greg Melich : Okay. Great, thanks. Richard Galanti : Yes. Why don\u2019t we take two more questions? Operator : And your next question comes from Oliver Chen. Oliver, your line is open. Oliver Chen : Can you hear me? Richard Galanti : Yes. Oliver Chen : Hi, guys. Thanks, Richard. Congrats on solid results. A lot of our survey data at Cowen does indicate that the Amazon prime crossover has mathematically increased over a multiyear period. Just what would you highlight as some of the features of your story that make you on Amazon for the long-term? And as you do your consumer insight and your consumer research are there aspects of your business model, which are just wanting to really be on top of just to make sure that you continue to appeal with millennials and generation Z and as shopping habits kind of shift? Richard Galanti : Well, I think the first piece of that question as it relates to the Cowen research piece that talked about, I guess you guys have surveyed, remember over the last \u2013 people over the last 5 or 6 years and there are more people, how many people used to have just a Costco card and then how many people had just an Amazon account, Amazon prime. And of course, over time, Amazon has picked up a lot and there is not as many unique ones. We would have expected that. My family has an Amazon card, not a card, but an account. And although I don\u2019t let them buy a lot, no, just kidding. At the end of the day, we will expect that. The internet in general is going to take its percentage of different categories. It\u2019s going to impact different categories and different retailers of such categories at different levels. I read the reports that some of you have written about that we and maybe one or two other retailers out there that are unique are Amazon proof or Internet proof. We don\u2019t buy that for a minute. We do believe that we do rely and we do expect we are going to be impacted loss. We also don\u2019t believe we have to go crazy on the other side, but we want both. But our value proposition is best served for us when it\u2019s in-store getting members to come in and buying when they can see everything there that we have. And so we think that we can win on both cards, have we lost a sale of something to an Internet provider out there, whether it\u2019s Amazon or someone else? I am sure we have. Have we gained more often than not? Absolutely. As the whole media business, videos, CDs and books, many years later, books for us is a new normal and it\u2019s still quite strong, maybe it\u2019s 70% or 80% of what it used to be, but it\u2019s strong and growing. The other two have changed for a lot of reasons including streaming. That being said, an area that a lot of traditional retailers are getting filled in out there is apparel. We are now in our third year averaging compounding over the nearly 3.5-year period in the low to mid-teens. Probably the mid-teens, I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me and growing. And so \u2013 and then I think on the fresh food side, fresh is difficult and we don\u2019t believe that everybody is going to just have everything delivered, but we are going to work hard to make sure that they want to come and see us. As it relates to, what was the last part of your question you were asking? Oliver Chen : I am curious about demographics and as you think about younger versus older in your core and where your age profile is shifting, just the reality of new customers is the seamless shopping experience. And what you talked about earlier, Richard, in terms of the access of convenience being a factor in terms of that and what you are thinking as you modernize and continue to stay fresh with younger customers as well? Richard Galanti : Well, again we have our limits by the way on some of those realities. I think for long time, again, convenience wasn\u2019t a word we even thought about. There are certain things we are not prepared to do, again, so smaller sizes in our pricing and have everything in the world available to you. Part of our strength is what we do. I think going forward even with millennials when our successor again it didn\u2019t start by 7 or 10 years ago, us sitting around on the table and saying how are we going to go after this new generation that want this staff? We have great merchants and great operators in 8 different regions in the U.S. and elsewhere and they are out there trying things. And every month has got better, in this case, the Bay Area region, their compatriot sought another \u2013 tries things in other regions. We turn around and nobody can benefit as much and do it as good as well as we do and so I don\u2019t think we sat around strategically by saying how do we go after them and evolved into that? Now, that we are there though, what else can we do for them and whether it\u2019s food items or other things? We also look \u2013 our membership marketing people have done a study recently in our presentation recently and it showed whatever the previous generation was before, it was a gen whatever and I know I am one of those baby boomers, which is not a baby anymore. Our average age versus the U.S. population just in 3 or 4 years has come down 2 years from a 4-year gap to a 2-year gap. Our goal is not necessarily get it to a zero gap. Our goal is to drive more business. When we look at the age group of millennials versus that same age group when the previous generation was that age, they are buying a little less, but not a lot less. When we look at what we did and these are again data points or sound bytes, but when we did look what we did 2.5 years ago on LivingSocial and now we have a full year of renewals on them. It was very interesting. Clearly, we would have expected more of those people to be millennials that signed up on that LivingSocial 10 or 12-day initiative that we did. And that was correct. What we were surprised at is that they actually shopped a little more frequently while a little less each time, but the aggregate of those two, they bought more over that year a little more, I mean, in the low single-digits, but there was more. It didn\u2019t have a bracket around it. And they renewed at a slightly higher rate. Now, then the walk in people that same months that would come in on their own just signed up, just walking together and the people that are walked in were on average a little older about 10 to 15 percentage point fewer penetration of millenials. And so that was encouraging to us. So while there is certainly extreme example in New York and the Bay Area and Teck there is a lot of people that still aren\u2019t embarrassed to tell they shop in-store and we got to have a lot of reasons to get you there. I am also excited of what we see we are going to be doing on .com, but I am not suggesting it\u2019s going to be trying to get your dinner there delivered to your doorstep if you have ordered by noon, that\u2019s not going to be us. Oliver Chen : Okay. Thanks, Richard. That\u2019s super helpful. Last question is like we are really enthusiastic and encouraged by how well you have done with your store traffic, your core store traffic trends. Do you I mean \u2013 is your expectation for this kind of steady low single-digit positive momentum to continue? Do you foresee that being somewhat volatile just given the reality of traffic trends? And as we do our models, is there anything we should know as the .com deal closes as well? Thank you. Richard Galanti : With regard to the latter, if they\u2019re doing a little business with us, they will probably stop doing a little business with us. There were a few items on there, I think they bought from us but not a lot. What was the first question, I got off on the tangent there? Oliver Chen : About store traffic\u2026? Richard Galanti : No look, we look at all these things, we block and tackle everyday. I am very excited about our merchandising initiatives in store as well. I am excited about some of the global sourcing stuff we are doing. We come back from our every four week budgeting meeting. We got some deep stuff coming out. I am excited, it\u2019s small but anyhow being able to sell directly SK-II and a heck of a lot of it in terms of the total marketing of that product and people are talking about it. And again, over 90% of our members coming into Costco buy a fresh food item. So they are coming there. Those are kind of things, how do we get you in store, because we get you in store you are going to buy a lot more than \u2013 we see that even with Google Express. That customer shop a few less times in the store, shop several more times online as well, do both. They will buy a little more over the course of the year, but they are buying a lot more each time when they go in store, because they see all that stuff. And so that\u2019s what we kind of keep doing. I think the value thing, I would encourage to look at some \u2013 do your own pricing study of exact like items, maybe you got to adjust for quantity, because you got to buy 128 or something, 124 something instead of 24 or something. But at the end of the day, you will be going to shocked, the difference in pricing, not just here and so we think we got a lot of things going on for us. We have no allusion though that the Internet is going away or that we should do more of it online our self as well. But clearly, we feel good about what we are doing in store and what we are going to continue to drive that business. Oliver Chen : Thanks. The SK-II is going to be great, baby boomers and luxury shoppers are going to love it, so congrats on that as well. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : And your final question comes from Brian Nagel. Oppenheimer Dan Farrell : Hi. This is Dan Farrell on for Brian Nagel. I was just wondering \u2013 thanks for sneaking us into. In terms of the membership benefits to some of the sales benefits you guys have been seeing after the new credit card signups, I was just wondering if you had any expectation on kind of how long those would persist throughout the year? Richard Galanti : Well, I think your big hit is going to be in the first three months or four months. And really, my guess is through Christmas, because there is going to be a lot of people buying more items, more bigger ticket items during that period of time. There will be additional initiatives like there were for 16 years whether it\u2019s tabling activities or other marketing pieces, that we will continue to do. I made a comment probably six months ago on one of these calls. In its own way, we think that this could be, in a way, a gift that keeps on giving. The value proposition of what we sell is great. Some of the new things that we have done merchandising wise whether it is our ticket not only the Costco tickets for events done in Southern California as the test, I am talking about the ticketing programs that we have in-store, the ever-increasing quality of our fresh foods, what we have done in apparel. There is a lot of things going on that I think will help us. And again I think the credit card, the new value proposition is \u2013 new value proposition will be one of them. When you think about the fact that effectively on virtually everything, you can get 4% off of Costco, between if you are an executive member and use the co-branded Costco, Citi Visa Anywhere card. For a company that markets its goods up 10% or 12% and I would think that we considered we can buy pretty well and put all our purchasing power in 3,700 items and then give you back up to 4% of that. That\u2019s a pretty good value and we have seen that anecdotally in a big way already from businesses. And I think we will continue to see it. Dan Farrell : Okay, great. And then just a follow-up regarding the transition, did you guys see any I guess infection in sales of things like big-ticket items that people may have been holding off on any when the card is being transitioned and then once the transition card were activated, did you see any inflection in those items? Richard Galanti : We did. Again, it\u2019s more dinner party discussion. We saw the biggest area we saw was hearing aids, a lot of things and of course that\u2019s not millennials. But \u2013 and the other thing would be big ticket electronics and the like. And my guess is in the case of the hearing aids, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised since there is a direct Costco employee member conversation eye to eye. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were some people out there that are over there several weeks leading up to it. They said if you wait and use this card, you will get another 2% off on a $2,000 item. So, my guess is that, that impacted a little bit too. Operator : And there are no further questions. Richard Galanti : Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. Have a good day. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO, you may begin your conference.

These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the Company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. For the 12-week fiscal first quarter, that ended two weeks ago Sunday \u2013 this past Sunday, earnings came in at $1.24 a share, up 14% or $0.15 a share over last year's reported earrings per share of $1.09. A few items to point out, as was mentioned in today's release, this year's first quarter benefited from a non-recurring $51 million legal settlement. This $51 million pre-tax figure represented a 19 basis point benefit to gross margin and a benefit to first quarter's earnings per share of $0.07 a share. Last year in the first quarter there were two non-recurring items that we mentioned that together negatively impacted last year's earnings results. In that quarter, we recorded a $22 million pre-tax charge, which represented an 8 basis point impact to SG&A to the negative and a reduction in last year's first quarter earnings of $0.04 a share. Stock compensation expense was 13% or $25 million higher year-over-year, so $0.04 a share more. There are about 4,800 people of our employees that receive restricted stock units as a significant part of their annual compensation. These grants are made annually each October in our fiscal first quarter, and then typically vest over a five-year period with accelerated vesting when the recipient reaches 25 years, 30 years and 35 years of employment with the Company. Factors driving this increase included additional levels of accelerated vesting given the rising number of our employees achieving long tenure with the Company. An increased stock price with a five-year ago grant coming off of the thing when the stock price was in the 80's to last year's grant when the stock price was in the 150\u2019s and of course having a larger number of employees in the plan. Note that the $25 million year-over-year increase in Q1 is a larger year-over-year dollar increase than we'd expect to record in each of the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters of this year, given the October RSU grant cycle. Next, gas profitability, our profits from gas during the quarter as compared to last year's first quarter were lower by about $20 million pre-tax or $0.03 a share, primarily a function of last year's very strong profit results in the first quarter for gas. Fifth, IT costs. These expenses negatively impacted SG&A in the first quarter on an incremental year-over-year basis by about $18 million or 5 basis points to SG&A, which is about $0.025 a share. And lastly, when I get to the discussion on year-over-year gross margin and SG&A comparisons, I\u2019ll review with you the very positive impact that our new Citi Visa deal has had on margins, SG&A and of course our bottom line. Turning to the first quarter sales, total reported sales were up 3% and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure on a reported basis came in at 1% year-over-year. Comp sales were negatively impacted by weaker FX relative to the U.S. dollar and slightly impacted by gas price deflation, for a combined negative impact to the reported comp number of about 0.75% of sales. Excluding gas deflation, the reported 1% U.S. comp figure for Q1 remained at 1%. The reported Canadian comp figure plus 4% would have been plus 5% ex-gas deflation in FX. And the reported 0% other international comp figure excluding gas and FX would have been plus 3%. Total comps reported at 1% for the quarter again excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 2% and of course this plus 2% total Company adjusted figure is also being impacted by increases in deflation and other merchandising categories overall primarily in foods and hardlines. In terms of new openings, in the first quarter we opened nine new locations which included one relo, so a net increase of eight. And later in the call, I will discuss our upcoming expansion plans for the balance of the fiscal year. This afternoon, I\u2019ll also touch on membership trends and renewal rates, again, discuss margins and SG&A in Q1; update on the Citi Visa, the new Citi Visa relationship and the card and which we began offering in the U.S. and Puerto Rico this past June 20th during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, talk about e-commerce and then a couple of other items of note. So going down the income statement, again sales for the first quarter, the 12 weeks ended November 20 were $27.5 billion, up 3% from last year's first quarter of $26.6 billion. And again, on a comp basis reported 1% in ex-gas and FX up 2%, again that up 2% still being impacted by other aspects of deflation that we hadn't called out historically. For the quarter, the plus 1% reported comp results were a combination of an average transaction decrease of 1.3% on a reported basis and an average shopping frequency increase of 2.2% to the positive. Now the average transaction decrease of 1.3%. This includes again the combined headwinds of FX and gas that I mentioned which is about 0.75%, and I am sure other levels of deflation in other categories. I will give some examples of that later in the call. In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, within the U.S., Northwest Texas and Midwest showed the best results. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Mexico, UK and Korea. In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, in terms of sales for those within food and sundries, overall, flat year-over-year with spirits, sundries and deli coming in best. Tobacco, of course, as I mentioned in the last call was down a little over 20% year-over-year as we continue to see lower sales in that category. As I mentioned before these big tobacco declines should anniversary this coming spring. For hardlines, also flat year-over-year. The departments with the strong results were hardware, tires, and health and beauty aids. I give you an example of deflation which is impacting this department. And November for example, our reported November sales, TV sales in dollars were up 2% and units were up 17%, so quite a bit of deflation on big ticket items as well as some of the fresh foods items that I mentioned earlier. Within softlines, up low single-digit comps with apparel, small electrics and special events being the standouts. And within fresh foods, produce and deli were the strongest departments. And in ancillary businesses, hearing aids and optical showed the best results. Again, in recent months we have seen additional deflation overall in the low-to-mid single-digit range in many food and fresh meat categories and a little more in some of the other non-food areas as I mentioned like electronics. Moving to the line items on the income statement, membership fees good results for the first quarter, coming in up 6% and 6 basis points as a percent of sales, up $37 million year-over-year. In terms of membership fees, good renewal rates, 90% U.S. and Canada actually 90.3% and 88% worldwide, rounding up to 88%. Continued increasing penetration of the executive membership and in terms of number of members at Q1 end, compared to fiscal year end 12 weeks earlier, Gold Star which stood at 36.8 million accounts, at Q1 end it was 37.1 million. Primary business was 7.3, both at fiscal year end and at Q1 end. Business add-ons 3.5 and 3.5. For total membership, household memberships 47.6 million at fiscal year end and up to 47.9 million at first quarter end and given that many of the people have two cards, many of the accounts have two cards. At fiscal year end, we stood at 86.7 million in cardholders and at first quarter end 87.3 million people with a membership card. At November 20 first quarter end, Executive Members stood at 17.7 million member households, an increase of 348,000 since the end of the previous quarter. That's about 29,000 additional Executive Members per week increased during the 12-week quarter. And as I have said before, Executive Members are a little over a third of our base and a little bit more than two-thirds of our sales where Executive Members are offered. In terms of renewal rates, our business renewal rate, which at fiscal year end stood at 94.4%, came in at 94.3% renewal rate as of first quarter end. Gold Star at 89.5% both at fiscal year end and at the first quarter end. For total 90.3% at fiscal year end and it remained at 90.3% at first quarter end. Worldwide, at year end it was 87.6% and it [tick to] [ph] 87.5% at first quarter end. As you know it's been probably almost two years in Canada when we converted to the MasterCard and with that we saw as we would have expected a slight decline in renewal rate. As occurred in Q4 2016 this past summer, we saw that finally reverse, and saw an uptick in renewal rates in Canada and that continued in Q1 of this fiscal year too. We are now seeing the same thing in the U.S. had ticked down a little bit over the last couple of quarters and have ticked down a little bit as well in Q1. We don't see any issues there at this point. Regarding membership fees, at the beginning of this past September or beginning of our fiscal year, we increased membership fees in our Asia operations, Taiwan, Korea and Japan as well as in Mexico and the UK. And again, that's because of \u2013 due to deferred accounting. It is about 15% of our membership fee income base and due to deferred accounting and the fact that it will roll in over the next 12 months in September that will be a little less than $0.01 a share a quarter. Before continuing down the income statement line items, a quick update on the Citi Visa card offering. This past June 20, midway through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we stopped accepting AMEX, American Express at all U.S. and Puerto Rico Costcos and at costco.com and began accepting all Visa cards, including of course, the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. The new card is great in terms of increased cash back rewards for our members and that\u2019s great for us as well in terms of driving member value and sales over the next years, and of course lowering our effective merchant fees related to the new program. In terms of new card, as was mentioned over the last couple of quarters on these calls, there were approximately 11.4 million AMEX, American Express co-branded cards or about 7.5 million accounts that were transferred from American Express to Citi for conversion to the new Citi Visa Anywhere card as over 85% of the accounts transferred over have been activated. And since the June 20 cutover several months ago, we have 1 million members that have signed up for have been approved for the new Citi Visa card. Most of them have it in hand, but to the extend that it was the last couple of weeks; they may not have gotten their card yet. In terms of conversion, usage and new sign up for the card, all good so far. Now turning to gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the first quarter was higher year-over-year by 29 basis points coming in at 11.58 this year versus 11.29 last year. As usual, a heavy jot down for the quarter a few numbers will just make the two columns for the quarter, reported and without gas deflation. In terms of core merchandising, year-over-year in the first quarter, core merchandising was up 19 basis points of 16 without gas deflation. Ancillary businesses down 5%, minus 5 year-over-year and for the quarter minus 6 without deflation, 2% reward, minus 2 in the quarter on a reported basis, minus 1 without gas deflation. LIFO minus 2 and minus 2, other which is the big one-time non-recurring benefit we got from the litigation settlement plus 19 basis points both for the reported and without gas. All told for the quarter, we reported again the 29 basis point improvement in ex-gas deflation and 26 basis points. So overall, again 26 basis points up on a kind of ex-gas basis. The core merchandise component was higher by 19 basis points year-over-year and again 16 without the gas deflation. The majority of the core gross margin increase and already taking out, we've separated out already the one-time legal settlement. About 13 basis points of that 16 if you will was due to higher year-over-year revenue share and bounties associated with the new Citi Visa agreement. Some of those monies go to the revenue line as revenue share. The gross margin of our notwithstanding debt, the gross margin of our core merchandising categories, which are the food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods. That gross margin as a percent of their own sales were higher year-over-year in the first quarter by 17 basis points with foods and sundries, hardlines and fresh foods all showing higher year-over-year margins and softlines being down a little bit year-over-year and one of the impacts was the warmth of the season and outerwear issues. Ancillary and other business gross margin was down 5 basis point, 6 basis points, ex-gas deflation in the quarter. All the function of the lower year-over-year gas profits as I discussed earlier in the call, ex-gasoline operations, all other ancillary and other business gross margins were up 6 basis points. 2% reward, again ex-gas, a negative impact of 1 basis point and that's inside margin. That's a sales penetration and the associated executive member awards from our executive members continue to grow. LIFO in the first quarter flat this year, we did not book a LIFO credit card charge and compared to a 2 basis point positive or a $5 million pre-tax credit last year in the quarter. And lastly, the one-time non-recurring legal settlement has benefited Q1 gross margin by 19 basis points as we discussed in beginning of the call. Moving on to SG&A, our SG&A percentage in the first quarter year-over-year was higher by 16 basis points on a reported basis and by 13 basis points on ex-gas deflation. Again, I'll have you just jot down a few line items, core operations for the quarter was higher or negative 8 basis points and without gas the negative 6. Central higher by 9 and 9 both reported without gas deflation. Stock compensation expense minus 7 and minus 6. Other plus 8 and plus 8 that\u2019s that rough $20 million or $22 million amount that I told you about earlier in the call that impacted SG&A to the positive last year versus nothing this year. And again reported SG&A was higher by 16 basis points in the quarter higher by 13 ex-gas deflation. The core operations component of SG&A again in the chart shows 8% higher \u2013 I\u2019m sorry 8 basis points higher year-over-year reported and 6 ex-gas. This minus 6 consisted of higher payroll and benefits of about 31 basis points year-over-year that certainly impacted by the lower sales result and certainly that's impacted by the deflation I\u2019ll give you a couple examples of that later. This was primarily offset by lower year-over-year merchant fees as a result of the switch to Citi Visa. That had a benefit to the SG&A line of plus 25 basis points impact of the positive. Central expense was higher year-over-year in Q1 by 9, increased IT spending again as I mentioned was 5 of that. Stock compensation expense higher by 5 or 6 without gas. And lastly, the other item I mentioned the plus 8 was non-recurring in nature. Next on the income statement line pre-opening expense was $4 million lower this year versus last year coming in at $22 million versus $26 million a year-ago really a function of openings. This year in Q1 we had 9 openings, last year 13 each of the 9 included 1 relo in the 13 last year in the first quarter and 2 relos, pretty much in line with that number of openings. All told, operating income in the first quarter came in up $82 million or 11, but up $9 million or 1% year-over-year excluding the - just the non-recurring items that I previously mentioned. Below the operating income line, interest expense in the first quarter came in at $29 million this year versus $33 million in last year. Lower due to the retirement of some senior notes in December of last year. Interest income and other was lowered by $2 million in the quarter coming at $26 million versus $28 million a year ago. Actual interest income from the quarter was better year-over-year this was offset by approximately $4.5 million in charges related to the FX transactions that usually fluctuate pluses and minuses in the zero to 10 million range, so no surprises there. Overall, reported pre-tax income on a reported basis was higher by 11% again higher by 1% ex those non-recurring items that I mentioned earlier in the call. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter came in at 34.4 for the quarter compared to 36.1 last year. We benefited from a couple of positive discrete items this year in Q1, our anticipated effective rate for the years expected to be approximately 35.2% as best we can tell at this point. Overall reported net income $545 million this year up $65 million from $480 million last year, so an increase of 14% ex the non-recurring items that I mentioned up 3%. And next for a quick rundown of other topics, while the balance sheet is included in this afternoon's press release. A couple of the balance sheet info items, depreciation and amortization from the cash flow statement which is not here for the quarter came in at $297 million for the quarter. Accounts Payable if you look at one of things we always look at is our accounts payable as a percent of inventories. On a reported basis it was up from a 100% a year-ago in the quarter and 203%. If you take out 9 merchandise payables and more of an accounts payable of merchandise versus inventories improved from a 90% to 93% from last year's first quarter into this year's first quarter end. Average inventory per warehouse was actually lower by about $67,000 per warehouse coming in right at $14.9 million a year ago and $14.83 million per location this year. FX was about roughly $70,000 lower, FX was about $170,000 lower just the impact of FX so about 100 net if you assume flat FX. That\u2019s about what majors was up electronics, it was up a $117,000, so really not a lot of pluses and minuses over sub-departments but pretty much in line and pretty much flat year-over-year. In terms of CapEx we spent approximately $670 million during the quarter and our estimate for the whole year as I mentioned hasn\u2019t changed from last quarter end, our expectation for fiscal 2017 is somewhere in the $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion range compared to $2.6 billion for all of fiscal 2016. Next, Costco online, we're now in of course in the U.S., Canada, UK, Mexico and more recently Korea and Taiwan. For the first quarter sales and profits were up, total online sales were up 8% in the quarter and 7% on a comp basis, pretty choppy essentially the first several weeks and the last several weeks of the quarter we're in the mid singles with the middle part of it in the low doubles, if you will. I want to point out that over the past three weeks and that would include the last week of Q1, which is the Thanksgiving week, and the first two weeks of our second fiscal quarter, e-com sales were up in the low to mid teens including some results for both Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And of course, that's not withstanding significant amount of TV sales which were essentially flat in dollars and up 15% in units. Lastly, as it relates to our online business, we are improving our offerings and enhancing our member experience. I've touched on this a little bit last quarter\u2019s call. Our current focus comes in three primary areas in terms of improving merchandise first, we are adding more exciting high-end brand in merchandise on an everyday basis, we are improving in stocks and high velocity items and there is a few other things that we will be doing coming in the first couple of months of the new calendar year. Second, we are improving the experience and functionality of our site, we are improving our search that we have and are continuing to do that. We have shortened the checkout process from many clicks to two and so a big improvement recognizing this is new for us. We are simplifying and automating our returns process, a much better experience particularly on big ticket items and we have seen great improvement in that in the last several weeks and we are improving our members' ability to track their orders. Again, that's something that we were terribly good at historically. And thirdly, we are improving our distribution logistics. We have increased the number of depots from where we fill online orders, so closer and faster and less expensive delivery. And again, look for more improved and quicker distribution comments from us in early calendar 2017. Next, in terms of expansion, I mentioned we had eight net new units this year, this fiscal first quarter. We plan two for Q2 and net of five for Q3, so ex the relocations. And a net of 16 in Q4 for anticipated number for the year of net new units of 31, 34 less than three relos, so 31 net new locations. Last year, recall we opened 29 so about 4.5% square footage growth. If we get to the 31 that would be about the same, about 4.25% plus square footage growth. Assuming the 31 net new openings in fiscal 2017 locations by country will be 16 in the U.S. Mind you that last year it was 21 out of 29 in the U.S., eight in Canada which is quite a number for Canada and one each in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Australia and Mexico as well as France, our first in France and also one in Iceland. Note that these include our first locations to open in France and Iceland and again those will be in late spring and early summer. Now as you can tell by the quarterly dispersion of these about half of the 31 planned openings are scheduled in Q4. To the extent a couple of those could slip into the next fiscal year, so be it. So somewhere in the very high 20s if not 30 or 31 is what we would expect. As of first quarter end, our total square footage stood at 104.5 million square feet. In terms of common stock repurchases, for the first quarter, we repurchased 809,000 shares for a total of $122 million on an average price of $151 a share. That compares to all of fiscal 2016, when we repurchased $477 million, 3.2 million shares at an average price of just under $150 a share. In terms of dividends, our currently quarterly dividend stands at $0.45 a share and that was a 12.5% increase and that was effective last spring. 12.5% increase from the prior $0.40 a share, so $0.45 a share on a quarter, so that yearly $1.80 dividend represents an annual cost to the Company of just under $800 million. Lastly, before I turn it back for Q&A, our fiscal 2017 second quarter schedule earnings release, date for the 12-week second quarter ending February 12, will be after market close on Thursday, March 2 with the earnings call that afternoon at 2 o'clock Pacific Time. I will now turn it back to Kimberlynn, and open it up for questions and answers. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So, Richard the new Citi agreement, was that a \u2013 was a total benefit in the quarter of 38 basis points if I'm hearing you right and I assume that was exactly what you thought it would be? Richard Galanti : Probably a little higher than we thought it would be. There's lots of nuances to the program in terms there's bounties that we received for signing up new members and applications that incents the warehouses to do that. There's revenue share on outside spend. I think that's a little more than we had anticipated. We knew and felt that over time it would go up because the exceptions of Visa in terms of the penetration Visa throughout all types of merchants and that happened a little faster than we had anticipated. There's also some other aspects of it, again, there's lots of little pieces, but those are two of the bigger ones. On the merchant side, on the fee side rather I think some of it's related to the fact that we were making estimates of the different reward - bad - buckets if you will, gas at 4, Costco at 2, those velocity categories at 3. Again there's all kinds of equations there that as that changes there's some sharing and so it's all good at this point. John Heinbockel : Well, as a sort of the follow-up to that is that recognizing there is some volatility, is roughly that level, is that what you would expect going forward. And right now it's covering right soft sales and some investments in labor would be \u2013 is the idea that when that \u2013 when the soft sales changes more of that drops to the bottom line or do you think you find other things to invest in? Richard Galanti : Well, time will tell, won\u2019t it. I think it's still an early program, we're in the first full fiscal quarter of it. Over the next couple of quarters as I said last quarter this will be the first time we'll try to provide a little bit more insight and I'm sure we'll be able to do a little bit more each time. As you know, we're going to invest in loyalty and growth and \u2013 while it's raining on everybody as it relates to higher levels of deflation. We're known for deflating the sell price sooner and faster and certainly one other sound bite example would be meat sales, just in the month of November meat sales were up 6% in dollars and 16% in pounds. That's the kind of stuff that this deflation, it's impacting all retailers of course, and it's probably impacting a lower margin quicker to pass it on up or down and certainly down faster, so all those things go into play. So time will tell. John Heinbockel : And then just lastly, have you found or when you think about this conceptually, is it better to make - more impactful to make price investments when we start the reflationary cycle, right. So not raising while others do as opposed to cutting more now, investing more in a deflationary recycle. Richard Galanti : Well, we\u2019re always going to do more extreme probably than others. Another example would be as I've said in the past as it relates to some different types of competition out there the competitive pricing moat has gotten wider which is good. We haven't used that to improve our margins consciously in that regard, the wider the better. And so we're constantly figuring out that. We are constantly going back to every supplier with our purchasing power, with our buying power as it relates to \u2013 and competition itself with private label to figure out how can we bring the quantity up, the quality up, and the price down. And we know we will sell more and each of us and our suppliers will make a little more times \u2013 a little less more times. And so that's what we do, that's what we're always doing. We see that in every monthly budget meetings. And so I think that we'll continue to do what we do. We're certainly not going to benefit from every extra dollar of income. We're going to figure out how to use it to drive that competitive spirit and to drive our sales. And that's been a little tougher in this tough deflationary environment. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. Hey guys. So my question relates to core profitability and expectations to the extent we can talk about it. So the EBIT growth this quarter was I think about 4% adjusted, the trend line has been a little lower and I'm not taking a lot of currency into this, but if you think about the core profitability going forward Richard, should we expect it to increase granted this quarter had a tough topline compare, we talked about maybe credit card getting better. I'm not thinking about membership price increase, but that's something that could come, but is this \u2013 just thinking about the overall business, how it\u2019s performing, do you expect it to do better than where it is or performing about where it should be? Richard Galanti : Well, again I'm not allowed to tell you what I think completely. We're encouraged by the last few weeks including the first two weeks of Q2, but yes we got - we feel good about our merchandising offerings, we feel good about some things we're doing operationally, we certainly feel good about the strength of KS, Kirkland Signature, and traffic has improved a little bit. I remember one of the analysts reports a few months ago, was we can exhale. We are hopefully beyond that right now. We feel that again the last - the traffic seems to hit a trough and it\u2019s come back a little, not that we expected to get back before it necessarily, but it certainly it's seems like it's back on the mend a little and we'll see. I feel we're doing a lot of good things; we got a lot of things up our sleeve in terms of merchandising, we\u2019re clearly merchandising and selling from a position of competitive strength. And fresh foods drives the business and the fact that renewal rates ex a little bit of impact from auto bill in the conversion are perfectly fine. So there\u2019s lot of good things out there and I guess I'll stop there. But overall we'll see. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then my follow-up, part of it relates to what John asked where you know the credit card benefit that could ramp. There also could be a membership pricing straight down the horizon. Thinking about what you\u2019ll reinvest versus what you drop down, I mean are you \u2013 is the investment rate being inhibited right now because you haven't had that membership price increase in a long time so or are you going to let some of these things flow to the bottom line when we get there. Richard Galanti : First, let me go back for a minute to the monies that we've benefited from as it relates to the Citi Visa the new agreement. In theory you would say okay if you made a little more [indiscernible] did you put it back in the pricing. We're doing a lot in pricing anyway and also you don't change the reward structure every day it's a new program. I would assume over time and this is - who knows if hypothetical but over the next couple of years if the performance of the program continues to go which we expected to do in the right direction and our piece of that action if you will versus the rewards that our members are getting, you\u2019d expect to see this change that over time. But we're way too early to even think about that. Historically, as it relates to membership increases, we usually invest that back in the business, a lot of that in terms of competitiveness and pricing and it kind of eases in over the next several years and more fully into the bottom line notwithstanding in fact that membership fee increases take about eight fiscal quarters to get into the income statement on the membership line because of deferred accounting. So I don't think first of all we certainly haven't done anything different. As we've seen in some examples where we do comp shops versus certain others, where that moat has gotten bigger if you will, that gap has gotten wider, we haven't said hey let's use this to get a few extra basis points of margin. We've held the course and we continued to go in that direction. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Hey, good afternoon Richard. Just want to touch back on margins with - we think about the core GPM, X the benefit from the Visa card. It was still up but maybe a little bit less than the past few quarters. If you can maybe just touch on that and then also on the SG&A, you mentioned the higher payroll and benefits but if I recall I think the second quarter last year is when you raise some wages. Is that correct and should we start to cycle some of that headwind? Richard Galanti : On the last point, the wages, I believe the U.S. and Canada which is 80 plus percent or 80% to 83% of our company. We took the bottom of the scale up a $50 basically from 11.50 in 12 up to 13 and 13.50. I believe on an annual basis that's about a $40 million incremental increase in our pre-tax costs or about $3 million little low $3 million per month number. That started in March, so that's kind of halfway through - early the halfway through Q2 of our fiscal year that's when the annual anniversaries and that's kind of a small. I'm sorry, the first part of the question, I didn't write it down. Paul Trussell : Just around core merchandise margins. Richard Galanti : Yes. Keep in mind, as I try to point out on each of these calls and mentioned what was the core, roughly 80% plus of our business that is food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods. What is that margin on its own sales? And again, as I mentioned earlier in the call, that was up 17 basis points. When I look at the weighted average of what impact it had on our Company margin year-over-year. It's a lot less than 17 because there's increased penetration of another category with a lower margin or reduced penetration of another category with a higher margin and so that tends to \u2013 that's what we pointed out. We don't see just because that that 80% was 17 basis points up on that that had a much smaller effect on the year-over-year for all company. Paul Trussell : Got it. And then just when it comes to topline, Richard, obviously November was kind of a tell of two periods with the first half of the month and the second half being much better and from the comments you made around e-commerce, it sounds like there's been some strength maybe that sustained into early part of December. Just kind of what's your view right now kind of the spending levels of your core customer and as we turn the corner into 2017, what's your thoughts around kind of what our core comp expectations should be particularly in the U.S.? Richard Galanti : Well, again, we don't know. We\u2019ll have to wait and see ourselves. We are thrilled that the first few weeks have been good. And again, November, the four weeks of November was choppy frankly, particularly the week of the election. I think it was worse than a snowstorm in terms of nobody wanting to go out and buy stuff and that\u2019s what I read about other retailers as well. And again, over the last few months it's been a little choppy a little more in November and a little weaker and so at least, what we can tell you at this point is the first couple of weeks have been okay. And again, traffic has seemed to have stabilized until something changes there, who knows. But again, we feel good about our merchandising what's going on and one of the reasons we continue to provide monthly sales results is for that reason to keep you guys informed and that's pretty much what I can tell you at this point. Paul Trussell : Fair enough. Thanks Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Richard, you mentioned that you signed up a million new members under the new Visa credit card arrangement. Is that above and beyond what you would normally sign up? Or is that typical with your run rate and how does that compare to your expectations? Richard Galanti : First of all, we signed \u2013 million of our members signed up for it. Many of them could very well be existing members that historically did not have an AMEX card or historically used not a co-branded AMEX card. And they have now signed up for this because they want to sign up because the rewards, hopefully or they historically again were using debit or non co-branded AMEX card and are now switching to this. So it's not that we did not generate a million new members. Certainly, when a new member being online or walks in and to sign up as a new member, we of course are telling them the virtues of both executive membership and these great new co-brand card. Michael Lasser : And how are you seeing the spending patterns of those who signed up for the card or got the card versus how they're spending patterns were under the AMEX card? Richard Galanti : It's hard to know this quickly. Generally speaking, irrespective of what credit card it is whether it's a co-branded or rewards card for an airline or hotel. Generally, we find the people on credit card spend more than by cash or check or debit. We also find the people with Executive Member spend more than non-Executive Member. So the trifecta if you will is when they are not only a member, but they're the Executive Member and they use the co-branded card. Lots of incentives for loyalty and for spend and for capacity of the spend. And so that's what we try to do, try to do it in not too hard of a seller as you might expect. And we've got a lot better doing the basics with it. We know existing members, by a lot historically based on their prior 12 months and it\u2019s a no-brainer to be an executive member, we make sure they know and we've done a better job of converting or getting people signed up as an executive member start with. The credit fee, of course is not completely in our hands whether it was the 16-year relationship \u2013 40-year relationship, 40-year or 60-year relationship with American Express or the new relationship here is up to the credit card issuer in this case Citi to accept or rejected application. Now, the ones it converted over they were all in the same deal, but anybody knew they are signing up for new card and there's going to be some people they get and some people don't. But when we do know is a million of the people that did sign up for have gotten it or approved and got it. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is on the prospects for import tariffs, what percentage of your goods do you import from overseas and if you could break that down between the Kirkland\u2019s brand and all other it would be very helpful? Richard Galanti : We\u2019re just asking or being asked that question recently and we're putting some members together. Our best guess is somewhere north of 20 and south of 30 and I give you a purposely large number because even you talk to some buyers in different apartments, you find out that it might be imported, but it's all based on this U.S. dollar sale and my guess would be somewhere in the mid-20s. Michael Lasser : Mid-20\u2019s as percentage of your total sales? Richard Galanti : Yes. Michael Lasser : Okay. Thank you so much and have a good night. Richard Galanti : In the U.S., now I'm assuming that includes \u2013 I'm including in that like electronics. Most electronics are purchased in U.S. dollars by U.S. trading companies that are arms of the overseas manufacture. And so again it's a little tenuous to come up with an exact number particularly since we just started looking at it. Michael Lasser : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Kelly Bania : Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask a different question about gross margin, it\u2019s still if you look at the core gross margin I think you set up 17 basis points still very strong, but I think it's been in the 10 basis point to 15 basis point range. I know you\u2019ve talked about online, organics some of the higher margin categories in the mix shift there, is just curious if those are really still some of the same drivers or if there's anything else going on there particularly as online seem to slow a little bit this quarter? Richard Galanti : I think part of it is as prices have deflated there are instances where we could make a little more, but not a lot more where others have not deflated them as much even though we're going to be the first to take it down and more there's still a little there on the table. Private label helps. I think those are the kinds of things and we've also in terms of driving business, working with our vendors to lower the price and drive more business. And we will participate in it, but we\u2019ll still make a little more. So there's lots of little reasons and again I'd be remiss to say, I mean year-over-year, we had just under a basis point and shrink recovery, in other words better shrink number, inventory shrinkage numbers. We don't talk about it because I mean good news is continues to improve a little for 30 years essentially. We were doing a better job of operating our businesses and controlling our inventories, but it's lots of little things. Kelly Bania : That's helpful. And then just another big picture question, lots of questions on the savings and how you would think about possibly maybe reinvesting some of that over the years, but as I hear you online and proving that experience to check out experience to search, do you look at ways to just make things more convenient for your members? Is there anything else you think about on the convenience front versus just the price front? Richard Galanti : I got to tell you, a little tongue-in-cheek here, but we arguably were little \u2013 have been \u2013 many years ago we like it to even do e-commerce, did a little bit begrudgingly, it took a while to do some more things. I think the things that we're doing offensively not defensively, but we're also probably a little stubborn along the way to suggest \u2013 there are some extreme examples of when a member orders a big ticket item electronics or light goods or whatever and the delivery window is much larger than anyone else's. They'd like to know it pops up the calendar and here it goes. When they want to return it that process was not very good. And some of these are quick fixes, search was not very good. That's been a quick fix to get a significant improvement and we get some more improvement. So I think that we're doing some things to that we've notwithstanding decent sales. We're investing in better [indiscernible], but by the way that's not at the expense of we want to take our prices down a little and those are truly independent whether it's IT modernization efforts some of which was in necessarily or you know what are we going to do with regard to we need another 10 million or 50 million or whatever to enhance the site, that is truly independent of what we're doing there. We know as Jim said it will set for 25 plus years and [indiscernible] is set for now five plus years. We are clearly a topline Company and we're best when we drive sales. We probably aren't as good at leveraging expenses when sales come down than others because we\u2019re not going to do some things, but we're clearly taking the offense. Again there is some things that perhaps we should've done earlier but we're already seeing some improvement in that we know that will help. Kelly Bania : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Sean Carson : Hi, Richard, this is Sean Carson for Karen. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you talk about your outlook for deflation and any signs of leveling off or maybe even an upswing? Richard Galanti : I'm sorry, I couldn\u2019t hear the question. Sean Carson : Sure. Sorry about that. Can you talk about your outlook for deflation and any signs for potentially leveling off or potentially an upswing? Richard Galanti : When we talk with different category buyers probably the ones that have more specific insider on the fresh foods size because they're dealing with commodities and negotiating they're actually looking at the futures contracts and more of the cost is the actual item, the orange or the poultry or the pork or whatever. Whereas sometimes that's not the case, I think usually when we ask there's another three months to six months whatever. And when it gets to the anniversarying of it, there\u2019s been some huge swings, some huge example of swings on some nuts which last year doubled and we\u2019re now down 35%. There's you know eggs of course are down well over 60% year-over-year. So if eggs were down even 50% it doesn't mean that people going to eat twice as many eggs to have flat sales. They're going to eat some more eggs, but not that many. So by the way a few of those things may help in the bakery, the margins of the bakery. We\u2019re going to - also not going to change the package the cost of 16 muffins or 15 muffins. So overall, I think the feeling has given that the last few months have been a little more deflationary. The view is that it's another few months of that, but they all believe that it's going to come back the other way and this is a lot of estimated semi-educated guesses among different departments. Sean Carson : And so I noticed there's also no LIFO reserve, apparently there is no charge or credit in the quarter. Is that right? Richard Galanti : Right. That's correct. Sean Carson : Okay. Thanks for that. Richard Galanti : By the way as effective the beginning of this fiscal year for 30 years we've been on our retail cost systems, retail inventory system. Most companies historically have been on a cost base system where you can get down more granularly to item level with the modernization that was part of this process too. With a cost system the way you value inventories will not have LIFO charges and credits in the future. Unidentified Company Representative : [Inaudible] Richard Galanti : At the beginning of the year you'll notice on our year-end balance sheet. We revalued the inventory at cost in a different way and it was about a $60 million plus reduction in inventory. At the beginning of the year but not a P&L impact. Sean Carson : Got it. Okay. Richard Galanti : To the extent there's inflation in the future, we will have a LIFO charge. I'm giving myself a thumb up. And once you have some LIFO charges, you can have credits. To the extent that there was LIFO as deflation right out of the box. You won't take that credit because you have no charge against to which you can take it. Sean Carson : Got it. All right. That explains it. Thanks for that. And just my follow-up is just an extra week this year. Can you give us a sense of the impact? I think my math was about $0.10 to $0.11, but curious if you think that\u2019s sort of the right vicinity. Richard Galanti : Well, it sounds like that's 2% of X. I don't have a calculator in front of me, [150 third] of a year. For the most part, most expenses even though say on a rental facility, you pay 12 monthly rents; we take it over the 53 weeks. I mean you don\u2019t get a [150 third] credit for that. We amortize it over the course of the 10 years or 20 years. And so there's not a lot of \u2013 it generally should be if it's 2% more weeks, it\u2019s 2% more earnings. Sean Carson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, Richard. My first question relates to the Citibank Visa deal. Can you tell what impact the enhanced cashback features have led to? Has it been in your view more sign ups, has Citi seen more traction with some of the categories where you increase the incentives for consumers? Richard Galanti : Well, I can't speak for Citi. To you I can't speak to them. But we certainly have discussion with them, but they\u2019ve made their own comments that I think we are generally positive about how the program is working so far for them. What I can tell you from our perspective is some of things I already mentioned in terms of \u2013 look it's a significant improvement in the value proposition of the reward to the members assuming they spend like they did. Hopefully, they'll spend more because of the 2% at Costco instead of 1% on top of executive rewards, the 4% on gas instead of 3% and 3% on velocity categories instead of 2%, so all that stuff is good. There's more utilization, there\u2019s more places to use the card. Typically these are smaller merchants that only perhaps accept certain brands over others, they pay higher fees, but we\u2019ll have to see. Matthew Fassler : Are there any surveys you\u2019ve conducted that would suggest customers have really digested that extra penny they're going to get back at the end of the year? Richard Galanti : No. Matthew Fassler : Okay. Richard Galanti : What I can tell you from talking to our Head of Membership marketing is it stands out in good print on everybody's monthly statement, they see it and it\u2019s pretty big pretty, pretty fast. And so I think those are the types of things that people look at. We know if any programs work. And again, based on Citi\u2019s comments, publicly it seems like it\u2019s working in the right direction for everyone which means more spend on it. Matthew Fassler : Great. And then my follow-up is on deflation and gross margin, we've looked through your transcripts going back quite a while and this is a period I think a remarkable deflation particularly in the context of a decent U.S. economy. In your experience, how those gross margin progress through a deflationary cycle? You talked about your expectations for when if and when deflation turns and number of months going forward et cetera. But in the past as you've seen food prices in particular recover, how do your gross margins tend to behave? Richard Galanti : Really is all over the board. I mean with inflation the dollars go up, the percent probably changes a little downwards, so that would imply perhaps a little bit of improvement in dollars, but it could be all over the board. Gas is an extreme example; it is a low margin competitive business. As prices tumbled dramatically across general competition, prices were lower, but not nearly proportional to the amount of savings to that retailer. We were able to improve our margins little and widen the gap that's a win-win. Another silly example is organics. Organics because there's perhaps a little bit of less price sensitive \u2013 elasticity to organic prices. We are able to make a little more margin not a lot and have a wider value proposition versus others, so those are good things for us. Generally speaking, when there was cost inflation on milk and cheese and things like that, we would point out as you know historically some of those quarters were we kept the chicken at 499 and margins went down essentially from something to nothing to the tune of $40 million a year on one item that was four, five years ago \u2013 four years ago. Conversely, when cheese prices fell, food court margins went up nicely because we've always \u2013 we never really change the price of a slice of pizza. So there's lots of little things that don't fit in a square box or \u2013 a square box or round hole here. I would say generally a little inflation is good, it help sales and we could be more competitive both up and down. And when price is going up, probably is a little bit more margin beneficial. Matthew Fassler : Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thanks Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Oliver Chen : Hi, Richard. Thanks. What are your thoughts regarding bricks plus clicks and whether that would be by online pick up in store, reserve in store, car pick up from store because we're just seeing a lot of innovation as retailers in pure plays go into physical retail that are previously digital, so I want to know what\u2019s you think about that and if it's meaningful for you and if we should be concerned about your long-term store traffic trends with the rise in Amazon. And then mobile is about two-thirds of online traffic from many retailers, what should we expect for your mobile app in the five-year plan for what you want to do there to make it really exciting and fun and great? Richard Galanti : Well first, we're fixing some of the basics and improving some of the basics and I'm pretty excited about some of those things. You mentioned a number of mobile versus non-mobile e-commerce sales. Our numbers are lower than that mobile, but they're improving quickly. Again, we\u2019ve recognized those things that we can and can't do. We think that we could and should do a lot more online, but we also as you pointed out want to get people into the warehouses. We think that some of the things that we do in store will keep them coming. So far it's not been an issue and even \u2013 while we try to point out these things each quarter in terms of traffic, in terms of even when traffic was impact a little bit, we\u2019re asked that $64,000 question is it all these other things. We see some of the categories that one would think would have been impacted negatively by it aren't being impacted negatively. In terms of click and pick up, we've looked at it and we are not prepared to do that at this point. When we see it in other places not just the other warehouse club, you need space for it or you need a lot less volume in the location for it neither of which we have and we're not getting a lot of demands for it. We do that at business centers. You can log on and get it delivered and so that's more for the business member not the individual. And we recognize that we're not the retailer, they're going to sell you a smaller pack size or something and even a little bit higher margin. That's not what we do. Now time will tell over time, there's a lot of things that are going on out there. We're looking at them. We've all seen the video from earlier this week about you just walk in. There's a lot of other brick and mortars that my guess would be far more impacted than us on that, but we'll have to wait and see. Again, we're going to \u2013 if renewal rates trends changed \u2013 by the way we\u2019ve been seeing the markets where we've done things with Google and where we work with Instacart as well. Google Express and Instacart are probably the most extreme example would be the bay area where we started with Google and that was their first market and certainly that's where they're headquartered. And it's doing fine what we found is an existing loyal member is coming in a few less times a year and shopping several more times plus certainly several more because it was zero. We are shopping more, but some of the two is more. They buy a lot less when they are doing it online when they come in and part of that is the experience of [walking in and seasonal there] even if not everything is offered, but [indiscernible]. So the good news is [Technical Difficulty]. Operator : You\u2019re live Mr. Galanti. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Hi, Oliver, yes. Oliver Chen : Thanks for answering that. I just wanted to briefly ask you, does scan and go make sense for you or is that something that's not conducive to your experience. And then as you do your own research on Amazon which categories or what would you say like try out your best competitive advantages and what are your opportunities just to make sure you remain very competitive against Amazon and how are you feeling about millennials and generation Z. It sounded like you still had a lot of good momentum with younger demographics? Richard Galanti : Well, look in terms of scan and go honestly we did a version of scan go literally 20 years ago a customer I remember walk in get an RF gun, radio frequency device walk around scan their own items come up to the front hand that thing to the cashier and the scanner and they print out a receipt. Needless to say, there's a lot more efficient things today. We continue to look at scan and go type things, we are not testing it currently but we are looking at it. And I\u2019m not suggesting we are going to do it. We have done self checkout for a while. We've chosen to not do self checkout and higher volume units because we get people through without it. And as it relates \u2013 in terms of millennials and generation Z all those numbers are doing better for us and part of it is things like not that we set down and strategic - how do we get them. We have a great value proposition certainly some of the things that we sell like organics in my view is a big impact to that. Certainly some of the things we do you know we've done a couple of tests with LivingSocial over the last couple of years. All those things, we think help. As it relates you asked question about Amazon and Amazon is also the word for everything out there that's delivered or dot com and everything else it's certainly they\u2019re doing a lot of things. We want to make sure we understand what all of these people are doing. We do not just from a competitive price shop and whether it's them or someone else. We recognize convenience is a value but there\u2019s also some things that we can and can't do. So I think that we're looking at these things offensively not defensively at this point. I don't think that I think we're encouraged when we see the level of millennials if you will that are signing up and we see the average age of our membership coming down. Now you know it was just a couple years ago when the average U.S. Costco adult member was four plus years older than the population as a whole now it's a little under two. And that's without a lot of planning but it's what we do and I think part of that's the merchandise selection and our ability to change merchandise pretty quickly and certainly things like again organic standout in a big way. I think the fact of what we're doing even on some things that aren't directly; they\u2019re all related to the business but ESG and sustainability how we take care of our employees, the culture. Those are things that, again, we didn\u2019t say we have to do better at that. We do best at that, we do a lot of good things like that. When it comes down to merchandising, we believe that organics, the KS, what we're very good at is driving value and we're probably not going to be the person that's the best of delivering smaller size goods to your house. There are some things we're going to do between that and nothing and again stay tuned for calendar 2017. Oliver Chen : Thanks. Happy holidays. Best Regards. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Dan Binder with Jefferies. Daniel Binder : Yes, hi. Good afternoon. My question was around some of the things you\u2019ve already covered including pricing and the moat that you said is opened up. And in light of that there's been a lot of debate around the traffic just north of 2% or just under 3% depending on the months and lot of questions around convenience. And I just wonder as you review this online strategy, do you think there needs to be a major shift towards a broader SKU assortment, obviously Amazon's got marketplace, Wal-Mart is building marketplace, targets chosen not to. Do you think as part of that convenience factor Costco just needs to materially up their SKU count online? Richard Galanti : Well, keep in mind we have materially upped it over the last couple of years. Recognizing it's still a fraction of anything else out there. If we were again at 3,700 active items in a physical location and roughly that many online excluding like office products which is through a third-party and there's several thousand of those items, but in terms of what we do ourselves and we now taken it up to 8-ish, 8,000 maybe a little more. Is it likely to go to 40,000 or 50,000? Absolutely not. Unless it does one-day, but I don't think so. And is it like you go up a little bit more? Sure. And is it likely for us to do a few more things that provide convenience? Yes, but we still want you in the door. And again to Amazon and others credit, they\u2019re trying a lot of things. Some will work and some won't and we're pretty good at understanding what works and figure out how to augment and to do what we know how to do and what we want to do. And we recognized that we can't be \u2013 sell you a smaller size or something and our margins nor we prepared to double or triple the margin to do so. Daniel Binder : Got it. My other question was around the membership fee or potential membership fee increase, next year that's been talked about quite a bit. I'm just curious if there's a sensitivity and what that threshold is, at which point you would not do it. In other words, if the comp store sales were to continue being at the level that they were at in the first quarter, would you be less likely to put it increase through and maybe an easier way to talk about it is what kind of comp level would you like to be at when you do it? Richard Galanti : Directionally, I responded in the past by saying if comps were a little weaker, it would be more likely to want to do it or no impact on that decision. It's all in our view about what additional values that we brought to the table. Whatever amount of an increase might be contemplated, have we improved the value proposition significantly greater in that amount which is in my view is always been a no-brainer for us. Our renewal rate is okay and if sales are a little weak, it would be the time to do it \u2013 not do it. I'm not trying to suggest that it\u2019s tomorrow afternoon, I'm just saying that generally speaking a little bit weaker we're going to use that to drive business. Daniel Binder : Okay. I guess my question, my response to that is, if you had this widening mode in place and you are priced right. This idea that you would reinvest membership fee dollars into price, do you think that would drive an incremental gain to get comps at a higher level? Richard Galanti : On some items, yes, on some of things that we do. If you keep in mind, 30 years ago, the original business for 33 years ago, the original business plan and talked about it. It doesn't matter where you locate. You could be on the other side of the railroad tracks and in downtrodden area people come to you, it\u2019s a destination. And that was fine until you add into that sentence until somebody is between you and your customer. And over time while we\u2019re certainly not at the mall, we recognized that we have to do something. So what we're doing online right now with some of the member experience and distributions, timing and costs and capabilities. Those are the types of things that we are investing in. Vertical integration and some aspects whether it's the chicken plant or bakery commissary in Canada. There's a lot of things that we're doing to drive value not just lower the price, but I don't \u2013 yes, I don't see it that being a reason to do it or not to do it. We look at it as a \u2013 it's a value proposition. We may become a little \u2013 price is primary and I think it will continue to be primary if we look at a few other things as well. Daniel Binder : Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Robert Ohmes : Thanks. Hey, Richard. Hey, you mentioned going into Iceland and France and I know you guys are doing Kirkland on Tmall in China. Can you just maybe sketch us up on when you might ponder opening brick and mortar up in the Mainland China? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, on Tmall I think it\u2019s about 300 items about a little over half of which are Kirkland Signature, so it\u2019s certainly the cast name is getting known and that's a positive. We've continued to look at it for a number of years. Is it in the next couple of three years? It's probably more likely to say yes to that than two years ago or five years ago, but there's nothing definite at this point. Robert Ohmes : Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the credit card. Is there any \u2013 the new sign ups for the card, anything on the demographic side of who is signing up that's different than what you were seeing with AMEX card? Richard Galanti : No. Not at all. I mean, they are called millennials instead of something else now, but that\u2019s no. Robert Ohmes : Got it. All right. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Benedict with Baird. Peter Benedict : Thanks. Couple of quick ones. First, just on the Google Express, can you just talk about are there any plans to expand that. I know you mentioned the Bay area, but we\u2019re hoping that being done or any thoughts to moving that out? Richard Galanti : Start of the Bay area, but then with LA area and in the last couple years is expanded to as well Chicago, Boston, New York and D.C. I believe they're expanding and we're expanding is a few other markets as well. I believe I don't have that list in front of me, but I know it includes a few more. So let's say it's going from 6-ish to 12-ish plus and now recognizing we're working with them in different markets, testing different things. I think we've done a couple of small tests with some fresh foods, but it's a limited selection of items and each of these are little different. Peter Benedict : Sure. I understood. On tobacco is that \u2013 is the weakness in tobacco - does that have any kind of a material effect on a core gross margin, I understand that\u2019s a very low margin for that product? Richard Galanti : Well, it's a low margin business so it would help improve the margin a little bit. Peter Benedict : I mean is that a material benefit to your core margins right now or is it\u2026 Richard Galanti : No. Gas would be an offset to that in a bigger way in my view. Peter Benedict : Okay. And then last just on capital allocation. Remind us kind of what your thoughts there in terms of priorities in a way that you on leverage \u2013 some of your leverage ratios to get down for the next year so what your thought there? Thank you. Richard Galanti : Well, first and far most CapEx is expansion and expansion is not \u2013 first and far most new units or the improvements in existing units a little bit, but probably an equal priority is all the things associated with it ancillary businesses, whether it's gas stations or as well as some of the manufacturing things we're doing. We're opening up a second \u2013 we\u2019ve had it for a number of years a B plan in Tracy, California. That does I think around 200 million pounds a year 4 plus million pounds a week of four or five items that are us. It's our items. We're opening B plan on the east coast shortly. In Canada, we're building. I think we've broken ground on a commissary for bakery. We are investing 250 million plus and closer to 300 million on a big chicken plant, processing plant in Nebraska. That is not broken ground yet, but it\u2019s in the process of getting permits and stuff. And so there's things like that as well. We're still spending money in IT, but priority-wise none of this stuff impacts what we're doing for expansion. We're expanding as much as we want you know we try to be - we look at our dividend every year you know historically it's been about 13% plus increase year-over-year for the last nine years or 10 years since its inception in 2005. We buyback a little stock, in terms of leverage you know arguably some would say that we are - I would say we're well capitalized, I would say we're under levered. We've got $1.1 billion 10-year fixed rate debt instrument that comes due in March 2017. The good news is that, it\u2019s got that low, low fixed rate of about I don't have it in front of me - about 5.5%. What we do in terms of whether writing a check for it or refinancing part of it, we\u2019ll see. So no big changes of what we do. We\u2019ve done a couple of special dividends, one in late 2012 and one in early 2015 and I'm not indicating if we are \u2013 we are into the future that was something that we chose to do it at that time. Peter Benedict : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Gregory Melich : Three quick ones. Of the 15% of people that haven't activated the card, what are those people using? Are they using other Visa in their wallet? What can you tell us about their behavior? Are they coming less frequently or using cash or what are they doing? Richard Galanti : Well a bunch of them it's between 11% and 15%. But a bunch of them is, are people that it was not active as a co-brand AMEX card. We had about 15% that had not \u2013 upon conversion about 15% of the 11% or whatever million people in the 7.5 million or so accounts about - just under 15% of them had not been using the prior two months I believe, the prior 60 days. And not to suggest that may be some of them just hadn\u2019t used it and they will use it or they\u2019ve been out of town or whatever else. It's every answer on this - and I think the vast majority of would be that, though, they were using something else in their wallet. And to the extent that the membership card was on the back, they still have it in their wallet and they still have to do it in their wallet and hopefully they see those giant signs and they reminded the cash register by the cashier and have you heard about the 4321 or the new exciting warranty program on electronic, on TVs where you get a four-year free warranty if you use it at Costco. Gregory Melich : All right. Any other ads you want to put out there, or we will leave it at that? Richard Galanti : I thought I would do that just I didn't have it in my script. Gregory Melich : That\u2019s great. So then the second question is on international, so that's an area that as traffic has been running below the U.S. now for a while which has been kind of unusual to look over the last few years. Could you give us some insight as to why that is and how that's behaving maybe in the markets where you raised the fee, is it linked to that? Or renewal rates doing okay in those markets where the fee went up? Richard Galanti : It's mostly cannibalization. We've got a $200 million, $300 million business. You open up a second one in that Citi. The new one does 100 to 100 in a quarter or 100 to 150 and 75 of its bled. Let\u2019s say your traffic number is the old unit that's being cannibalized, so on the basis of 10 or 12 units that\u2019s the biggest single reason. Gregory Melich : And on the markets where the fee went up. Richard Galanti : There is probably a little bit of softness in Japan beyond that. And I can't say you why and other than \u2013 the economy has been tough there, but it rains on everybody. Gregory Melich : And in terms of the markets where the fee went up, what have renewal rates done in those markets? Richard Galanti : I am sorry. Gregory Melich : What have renewal rates done in the markets where the fee was increased? Richard Galanti : Well, it just happened three months ago. We don't have any numbers yet, but it's de minimis of anything. And that's why I actually asked our marketing people earlier today [indiscernible]. Bob has made a good point. It takes about six months to know because you've got people not every member comes in every two weeks. So trend wise we don't see any big issue there at all. Gregory Melich : Fair enough. Good luck. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Grey. Why don\u2019t we take two more questions? Operator : Your next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky : Hello Richard. Just a quick question about what you're seeing in Visa usage from people who are using \u2013 who never were AMEX card, Costco AMEX cardholders and how they're spending behavior is changed or somehow affected by Costco accepting Visa's payment now? Richard Galanti : It's up. Particularly somebody \u2013 to the extent somebody is choosing to use another Visa card in his or her wallet. Maybe it\u2019s airline program or hotel program. They may not be spending more because nothing is changed in their wallet. To the extent that they are using cash or debit that's you see an increase and we have seen that as we would have expected. Chuck Cerankosky : Are you seeing any related impact on membership? Are you able to see if new members are being generated by the Visa acceptance? Richard Galanti : Well, we know that's the case to a small extent though, Citi for example is done marketing activities in their branches, but it's more existing members that it converted and you'll get a few \u2013 few could be in the tens of thousands, but out of a million couple or 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 is not a big piece of that. Chuck Cerankosky : All right. Thank you. End of Q& A Operator : And we have no further questions. Richard Galanti : Okay. Well, thank you everyone. Have a good afternoon. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Baird Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse Greg Melich - Evercore ISI Molly Smith - Bloomberg Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Frederica and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco Q2 Earnings Call and February Sales Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO, sir you may begin your conference. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Frederica and good afternoon to everyone. I\u2019ll start by saying that these discussions will include forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today\u2019s press release, we reported - three things to discuss. We reported our second quarter and fiscal first half 2017 operating results for the 12-week and 24-week periods ended February 12. We also reported our monthly sales results for the four-week reporting month of February, which ended this past Sunday, February 26. And we announced our plans for membership fee increase in the US and Canada effective this coming June 1. For the 12-week fiscal second quarter, earnings came in at a $1.17 a share or $0.07 below last year's earnings results of $1.24. Some items of note, first, our co-branded credit card and how it impacts our results. Similar to what we reported in our first quarter results, the Citi Visa co-branded credit card program, which went live last June 20, partially impact our margins by 16 basis points, our SG&A expenses by 24 basis points as compared to a year earlier, and our overall bottom line in Q2, benefiting earnings by $0.16 a share. A more detail on that, later in the call. Second, gas profitability, our profits from gasoline during the quarter as compared to last year's second quarter were lower by 42 million pre-tax or $0.06 a share. This primarily a function of last year's very strong second quarter gas profit results and is consistent with the impact of the gas profitability that rises in gas prices will cause on our earnings of gas.  Number three, IT expenses, our IT activities impacted SG&A in Q2, on an incremental year-over-year basis by $26 million pre-tax or 7 basis points or - SG&A of $0.04 a share compared to last year. This reflects both the direct expenses for the quarter, as well as increasing levels of depreciation and amortization on major completed projects that are now in service. Number four, stock compensation expense, this one is getting less of a negative impact each year, so it is a little smaller than spend. It was 10% higher year-over-year. So $10 million higher or about $0.015 impact to the P&L. FX, number five, there are two FX items to point out. The first one which I typically point out is the - how the impact is to changes in foreign currencies relative to the US dollar year-over-year. As compared to your ago during the second quarter, many of the foreign countries and locations where we operate began to strengthen during the quarter versus the US dollar, most notably in Canada, resulting in our foreign earnings in Q2 when converted into US dollars being slightly higher by about 4 million pre-tax or a about $0.01 a share, then if the exchange rates have been flat year-over-year. Number two, as it relates to FX is a much bigger impact to this quarters P&L had to do with FX losses related to forward contracts and US dollar holdings by our international subsidiaries, these are used to pay US dollar denominated merchandise payables in those countries. Losses on those exceeded the gains on the related US dollar denominated payables. This year in the second quarter, it was roughly $20 million pre-tax hit. Last year in Q2, the gains on those payables exceeded the net losses on forward contracts at US dollar holdings by plus $6 million. So year-over-year $26 million year-over-year swing or an impact - negative impacted P&L by $0.04 a share. I might add that this year-over-year swing, it generally runs in the plus or minus $0.00 to $0.02 a share range, with all the volatility out there it was a little bigger this quarter. Number six, LIFO, there was no LIFO charge or credit in this year's second quarter results. Whereas in last year's Q2 results it had a LIFO credit $15 million, reflecting deflation in our LIFO indices and so positively impacted last year's Q2 by $0.02 a share. While we did have some deflation in the quarter, as we did in Q1 with the switch over to a new accounting system and platform in the beginning of the fiscal year. Basically even though, we\u2019ve had deflation, we have no associated previous inflation or LIFO charges historically taken and so if you will, there is a buildup of credit that will offset future LIFO charges to the extent that there is inflation in the future, but again year-over-year that\u2019s a $0.02 hit to the quarter, year-over-year swing. Number seven income taxes, last year in Q2, our effective income taxes tax rate was right at 34%. Due to a discrete tax item this year in Q2, as well as small changes in the profitability mix by country. Our effective rate this year came rather at - instead of the 34.0 came in at 35.6, effectively impacting our Q2 EPS by about $0.03 a share. Turning to our second quarter sales, reported sales were up 6% and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure came in at up 3%. For the quarter, the 3% plus comparable sales figure was helped by gasoline price inflation to the tune of about 84 basis points, while the impact from FX was a very slight detriment, again, well currency strengthened during the quarter, the net over the quarter was still a slight detriment of about minus 9 basis points, so together about three-quarts of a percent hit. Excluding gas price inflation the reported plus 3% US comp remained at 3%. Our reported Canadian comp of plus 8% was actually a plus 2%, excluding gas and inflation and FX, mind you that we get Canadian dollar strengthening quite a bit, and the reported minus 2 other international comp, excluding gas and FX would have been a plus. Also total comps reported for the quarter at 3% plus for the quarter, excluding gas and FX with the pluses and the minus still remained at plus 3% ex gas and FX. For our four-week month of February, which included the last two weeks of the fiscal second quarter and the first two weeks of February did, comps came in at plus 4. On a reported basis, this consisted of a plus 5 reported in Canada - a plus 5 reported in the US, a plus 10 reported in Canada, and a minus 2 reported for other international. As I discussed last month, or actually as we discussed on a monthly sales call last month, the calendar shift of the Chinese lunar New Year, that was 11 days earlier versus last year, that positively benefited the January reporting period this year and negatively impacted February.  We estimate that this shift was a detriment to February comps of about three quarters of a percent on the total company and 6.5 percentage points or 650 basis points to the other international segment. Sales in February were positively impacted by both gasoline inflation to the tune of a little over 200 basis points, and by overall strengthening in foreign currencies relative to the dollar to the tune of about plus 60 basis points. Ex-gas inflation in FX, in Canada, the reported plus 10 would have been also a plus 2, and the minus 2 reported further in international would have been a minus 1 ex gas impacts and a plus 5 excluding the lunar New Year shift. Total company comps for the month reported a plus 4, would have been a plus 2, excluding gas deflation and FX. I also point out cannibalization, you know we do that every quarter and typically it\u2019s somewhere in the 0.5% range or a little less. Cannibalization has become a little bigger of a factor to our comp sales results in the last couple of months. The cannibalization impact on February was approximately 90 basis points negative for the total company and it was actually is minus 75 in January. For February, it was minus 300 basis points in Canada, mind you this year we are opening seven - I believe seven new warehouses on a base of 91 up there. So, a lot of relative cannibalization in Canada, and minus 180 basis points on the other international segments in February. I mentioned that the minus 90 basis points in February for the total company by comparison for all of fiscal years 2015 and 2016, total company cannibalization to average a little under 40 basis points to the negative. So again it\u2019s picked up of late with some of the openings. We estimate weather had a negative impact on February comps as we had snow in the east and heavy rains in the west. The estimated impact in that was about 50 basis points in the US, about 75 in Canada, and to the total company also about 50. Regarding deflation, overall, primarily in the US, we have seen deflation in the 1%, 1.5% range in February. Departments such as foods, sundries, frozen foods, liquor meat, dairy showed the most deflation on the foods and sundries side. On the non-food side consumer electronics continue to be deflationary, primarily in the TV category. In terms of new openings, our opening activities, we planned, we opened a net of a 8 new locations during the first quarter, nine less were re-low. In Q2, we opened four new locations. Those included our 13th unit in each of Korea and Taiwan, as well as two new locations in Florida in the Tampa Florida area. For all of fiscal 2017, we have current plans of 29 net new locations, so 17 additional openings during the third and fourth quarters of 2017 are planned. Of the 29 for the year, 14 in the US, 8 in Canada, I mention seven earlier, it\u2019s actually eight on a base of 91 in Canada and one each in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, and Australia, as well as our first openings in France and Iceland, most likely in mid-to-late May. This afternoon, I\u2019ll also review with you membership trends and renewal rates. Our membership fleet plans in terms of increases in June, and update on the Citi Visa Anywhere card, an update on our multi-vendor mailer promotional activities, additional discussion of course on margins and SG&A and a little bit about e-commerce results and some initiatives there as well. In terms of second quarter results, quickly on the sales, for the quarter sales were up 6% to $29.13 billion. On a reported comp basis, they were up 3% and again ex gas and FX, they still remained at 3%. For the quarter, the plus 3 reported comp was a combination of an average transaction increase of a little over 1%, and an average shopping frequency increase of 2% for the quarter. That is the company-wide frequency in the quarter for the US was a 3%. In terms of geographic sales by geographic regions, the Midwest, Texas, and Northwest regions were strongest, with California not far behind. Internationally, in local currencies, better performing countries were Mexico, UK and Korea. In terms of merchandise category sales for the quarter, for the second quarter within food and sundries, overall flattish year-over-year, liquor or spirits, and foods were the leaders. Tobacco continues to be a negative, and actually in the high teens, as we've mentioned, that we look to cycle the majority of that tobacco sales losses by the end of June. For hardlines, overall in the low-to-mid single-digits. The strongest department results were tires, hardware, and seasonal, with consumer electronics down in the low singles. Softlines were also up in the low to mid single-digit range, with apparel and home furnishings showing the strongest results. In fresh foods, comp sales were also in the low to mid single-digits. And lastly, in the second quarter overall, again in terms of deflation, for the second quarter was in the 1.5% to 2% range. Similar departments on the foods and sundries side, non-foods again, saw a little deflation in consumer electronics, primarily TVs. For February, traffic was up approximately 2% and 3% in the US - including 3% in the US. While average transaction was up a little under 2.5%, most of this was due to gas inflation and FX. In terms of geography, for February, Midwest, Texas, San Diego region, which also in our case includes Arizona and Colorado and New Mexico, were the strongest, as well as the Bay Area. Internationally, in local currencies, UK, Mexico, and Canada were at the top of the list. From a merchandise category standpoint, excluding FX, food and sundries and hardlines, including the consumer electronics were up low single-digits, softlines up mid single, and fresh foods slightly negative for the February reporting period. Again, a little deflation is impacting these numbers. Before moving to the income statement, a few comments about our multi-vendor mailer, the coupon booklets that we send out and have online, what we call the MVMs, these promotional activities, and a few changes we've recently implemented. As most of you know for many, many years ago, the MVMs have grown and evolved over 22 years, from one six week summer coupon booklet back in 1995, to generally year-around promotional price pieces with great values on items being offered in each mailer. Over the years, we've expanded the mailers, and have continued to tweak them. More recently, we've revamped the MVM program, creating it some newness, enhancing values - member values on some of the items - many of the items, and created a little bit more merchandising excitement. We've eliminated a few of the MVMs over the course of the year, and also there will be fewer days. We've reduced the number of items per mailer, but we've overall increased the offering in terms of total savings of those items. And we're also moving in some cases, to everyday low pricing, EDLP, where we can drive higher over sales, and show better every day pricing and value. In terms of second quarter of 2017, it was really the transition to fiscal quarter for these MVM changes, if you will. The first revamped MVM ran in December, and which is near the beginning of Q2. Overall, in the second quarter, we had 17 fewer MVM promotional days. Mind you, the quarter itself is 12 weeks times 7 is 84, a couple days closed for the holidays, but basically 17 out of those 84. 71 fewer items offered in those MVMs, but again, higher overall sales compared to last year in the MVMs. Overall, so far, we like what we see. We continue to tweak it a little, but remember, we're still in the early stages of this. We know that 17 fewer MVM days in our 84 day second quarter, and 10 fewer MVM days in our 28 day month of February, probably hurt traffic a little. But we shouldn't see that latter aspect in Q3, as there are the same number of MVM days year-over-year in the third quarter. So again, Q2 is really the transition of that. Now moving on to the line items in the income statement, in terms of membership fees, coming in at $636 million, up 5% or $33 million versus last year or down 1 basis point. Minimal impact from FX, because, again, while they were increasing over the course of the year, they started off lower in the beginning of the second quarter. In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, coming in a little over 90% in the US and Canada, and 87.7% worldwide on a fully captured basis. And we continue to see increasing penetration of the Executive Membership program in the countries where we offer it. In terms of number of members at Q2 end, at Q2 end, primary Gold Star came in at 37.5 million, up from 12 weeks earlier at 37.1 million. Primary business, 7.4 million, up from 7.3 million 12 weeks earlier. Business add-on, 3.4 million, down from 3.5 million. That has to do with some of those people converting into their own membership, as generally as they become Executive Members. So total accounts, 48.3 million compared to 47.9 million, a fiscal quarter earlier. Total card holders, 88.1 million at second quarter end, up from 87.3 million 12-weeks earlier. As of Q2 end, our paid Executive Memberships stood at 17.9 million, which is an increase of about 200,000 from 12-weeks earlier, or about 17,000 additional per week. Executive Members represented a little over one-third of our member base, and about two-thirds of our sales. In terms of renewal rates, again, overall, in the US and Canada 90.2, down 1/10 from 90.3 at the end of the quarter, which was also 90.3 at the end of the fiscal year back in late August. Business within that remained at 94.3, in both fiscal one and two quarters end. And Gold Star, primary Gold Star at 89.5. Again, it probably a little rounding, just pushed it down, instead of up, that tenth of a percentage point. Worldwide, it actually picked up a little. At Q2 end, it was 87.7 up from 87.5% at Q2 end, and 87.6 at fiscal year end. We feel these are pretty good numbers, and don't really see a lot of impact. We believe a lot of it has to do with the conversions in credit cards. If you'll recall, me talking, probably a year, a year and a half ago, about some of this stuff we saw in Canada as we transitioned the Canadian credit card program, a year and a half or so earlier, than we did in last June here in the US. And if I look back, as an example, just a year ago in Q3, the Canadian renewal rate was 90.6 for this quarter, as a 91.6, so it started to come back as we would expect. Again, in the US, we're still seeing some of that auto bill impact that we believe has a big piece of it. Back in Q3, a year ago, we were 90.3, and actually 90.4 the prior quarter, down to 90.1 at the end of the year. And we're 89.9 at Q2 2017 end. So again, pretty much the kind of impact that we would have expected to see, and I'm not really terribly concerned about that at all. I want to spend a minute, regarding our announcement on the increases of fees this morning, which will be effective June 1. First, the planned increases relate to our US and Canadian operations. Recall that fee increases, membership fee increases took place in several other countries effective this past September 1 at the beginning of the fiscal year.  In both, the US and Canada, which by the way, represents just under 90% of our Company's fees, about 87% or 88%, the current annual fee for our individual Gold Star business and business add-on memberships, what we refer to as our primary memberships is currently $55 a year, and has been at that level since November of 2011, about 5.5 years ago. The annual fees for these memberships will go to $60 effective June 1. Also in the US and Canada, our $110 per year Executive Membership fee, which has been at that level also since November of 2011 is being increased by $10 to $120. Also with regard to Executive Membership, the 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership will increase. Currently, the annual reward is capped at $750. That will be increased to $1,000. So while there is an increase in the annual fee, the reward goes up to $1,000, and that's based on eligible purchases. That, of course, is in addition to the 2% reward that one gets, if they use the Citi Visa Anywhere card at Costco, or the 4% when they buy gas at Costco. In all, approximately 35 million member households will be impacted by this increase, approximately half of whom are Executive Members, and half of whom are primary Gold Star business and business add-on members. Note that the membership fees are accounted for on a deferred basis. So in terms of how it hits our P&L, our membership income line, approximately one-twelfth if you will, or one month worth of the increase in fees from the June renewers, that will be the first group that gets this fee increase, approximately 1/12 of the increase will be booked to the income statement in that first month of June, with an additional 1/12 being booked in each of the succeeding 11 months. Next, the increased fees from our July renewals, those will be booked starting in July, one-twelfth and following through to the following June, and so on. So the full P&L impact of these increases will be over a 23 month time line, such that the last group of members to be billed at these new levels will be next May of 2018, with a booking if you will, of those $5 and $10 increases being recorded over that month, and its succeeding 11 months, i.e. 23 months out. Before continuing down the income statement line items, a quick update, and a few updated stats on the Citi Visa card offering. Again, this began last June 20, early in our fourth quarter of 2016. Recall that we began last June 20, with approximately 11.4 million co-branded cards, or about 7.4 million accounts being transferred to Citi for a conversion to the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. As of Q2 end, just under 90% of these accounts transferred have been activated, recognizing all accounts transferred to begin with, were not activated. And I think, it was down in the low 80s at the time - low to mid 80s. And in fact, that just under 90% activated as of Q2 end. That's up a few percentage points from Q1 end, 12 weeks earlier. Also we now have about 1.2 million new approved member accounts, representing about 1.6 million new Citi Visa cards out there, since the June 20 conversion. Again, this is also up about 200,000 accounts, over the past 12 weeks during fiscal second quarter. Lastly, we are seeing Citi Visa co-brand portfolio total spend higher year-over-year, both organically from the cards converted last June, as well as from these new accounts. We'll see what the next few quarters bring. Overall, in terms of conversion, usage, and new sign-ups for the card, we feel it's going pretty well so far. Going down to the gross margin line, our gross margin in second quarter was lower on a reported basis, was lower year-over-year by 24 basis points, coming in at 11.00, compared to last year's 11.24. Now as usual, there's a lot of moving parts here, gas inflation and the impact of the credit card, some of that benefit goes to the sales line, which therefore improves the reported margin. I'll let your do - I'll ask you to do my little matrix here. We'll do it for first and second quarters. There will be four columns, reported Q1 2017, without gas deflation in Q1 2017 is the second column, third column is reported Q2 2017, and the last column would be without gas inflation in Q2 2017. The first line item would be core merchandise. In Q1, reported, plus 19 basis points year-over-year, without gas deflation, plus 16 basis points. For Q2, reported plus 1 basis point, and without gas inflation, plus 9 basis points. Ancillary businesses, minus 5 and minus 6 in the two Q1 columns. In Q2 2017, in the two columns, minus 20 basis points and minus 18 basis points, again, reflecting lower margins in gas year-over-year, while increasing the penetration of gas sales. 2% reward, minus 2 basis points and minus 1 in columns one and two, and in columns three and four, 0 and minus 1. LIFO, minus 2 and minus 2 in Q1, and minus 5 and minus 5 in Q2. Again, recognizing that the year ago, we had deflation and therefore LIFO credits. This year, while we had deflation, we can't take them, since there's nothing to take them from prior offsetting LIFO charges. Other, last year there was, I believe, a one-time legal settlement that added 19 basis points to the first two columns here, and 0 and 0 in columns three and four. You add all that up, last year in the first quarter, year-over-year margins were up 29 basis points on a reported basis, and up 26 basis points ex gas deflation. I also mentioned last year, that within those numbers, the Citi Visa impact to margins within that 29 and 26, was plus 13. In the next two columns, the reported Q2 2017. Again, margins on a reported basis came in 24 basis points lower year-over-year, and ex gas and FX came in 15 basis points lower than last year. Now mind you, both of those numbers still include, do include the benefit from the Citi Visa program, to the tune of about 16 basis points to the positive. So again, taking those out, the reported minus 24, adding the 16 in, that would be a minus 40. And adding 16 to the minus 15, it would be a minus 31 on an adjusted basis, if you will using Citi Visa. Now the core merchandise component of gross margin was higher by 1, as you see in the chart, and plus 9, excluding gas. Excluding the benefits of Citi Visa, it was minus 15, and minus 7, excluding gas inflation. As I always mention, sub categories within the margin, our core sub categories, food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percent of their own sales were positive year-over-year by 7 basis points. But with the declining sales penetration of that, given the inflation in gas, the contribution is a minus 7. Food and sundries and hardlines were both slightly higher year-over-year on their own sales, softlines was up about 60 basis points, and fresh foods was lower year-over-year by about 10 basis points. Ancillary and other business gross margin, I mentioned was down 20 in the quarter. Most of the year-over-year decrease was due to lower gas profits, as I mentioned earlier in the call. 2% reward, 1 basis point of negative impact to ex gas, just implying a slightly higher sales penetration, ex gas inflation on a year-over-year basis. And I already mentioned LIFO that was about $0.02 a share as well. Overall, our margins ex the Citi Visa Credit Card benefit, were most negatively impacted by lower gas margins. Somewhat negatively impacted by 5 basis points from LIFO year-over-year, with slightly lower year-over-year sales penetration in the quarter also hurting it a little bit, even though core margins on the core sales were up 7 basis points. I might also mention that the plus 7 basis points core margin improvement year-over-year, this is notwithstanding some of the pricing initiatives that I mentioned earlier like EDLP that we've been taking these last couple months. Moving to reported SG&A, our SG&A percentage in second quarter year-over-year was lower or better by 5 basis points, but higher or worse by 4 ex gas inflation, coming in at 10.23% this year, compared to 10.28% last year, on a reported basis. Again, excluding the benefits of the Citi Visa Program, which clearly helped SG&A by lowering merchant charges that was a 19 basis - excluding benefits from that, year-over-year SG&A was higher by 19 basis points, and 28 basis points ex gas inflation. In terms of the performance year-over-year, and SG&A operations component, as I mentioned was lower or better by 8 basis points year-over-year, and plus 1, excluding the impact of gas. You see that in the chart we just drew. The plus 8 basis point improvement consists again, of much lower Citi Visa merchant fees and related fees, somewhat offset primarily by higher payroll and employee benefits costs. And again, that has to do with the underlying sales being a little lower, and a few other things. Central expense was higher year-over-year in Q2 by 2 basis points, 3 without gas. Again, IT was a 7 or 8 without gas of that, and offset by a couple things that went our other way. Stock compensation expense, again 1 to 2 basis points, not a big amount. Moving down to pre-opening expense. Pre-opening expense was higher by $5 million, coming in at $15 million in Q2 of 2017, versus $10 million a year earlier. Pre-opening relates, not only to the actual openings in that quarter, but also some of the ones leading up to it, or getting ready to be open rather. That was four openings in Q2 this year, only one opening last year. There's also higher year-over-year pre-opening expenses related to our entrance into two new countries, France and Iceland, as we already have people on the ground. Operating income in Q2, all told, came in at $840 million - $844 million, 1% lower or $12 million lower from last year's $856 million. Below operating income line, reported interest expense, came in at $31 million, in both this and last year's fiscal second quarters. Interest expense - I might mention that interest expense, beginning part way through Q3 - I believe the middle of March, will improve quite a bit, with the scheduled March 15, $1.1 billion debt repayment. This is a 10-year fixed rate debt instrument, I believe, at 5.5% - about 5.5% fixed rate interest. Net, we'll save about $50 million a year pre-tax, about $60 million of reduced interest expense on that pre-tax, offset by cutting a check for the $1.1 billion if you will, and losing some interest income on that, to the tune of roughly $10 million. And that's just a simple guesstimate. Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $20 million in the quarter. I was just informed that I skipped the SG&A chart. So, why don't we go back and write that, just so it's easier for those of you that put it down. Thank you. Again, four columns for SG&A, reported, and without gas deflation Q1 2017 and Q1 2017, and reported or without gas inflation Q2 2017 and Q2 2017. I think these numbers that I just read, will make a little more sense. Operations, Q1 2017 reported minus 8 basis points or higher by 8 basis points, and minus 6 without gas deflation, plus 8 and plus 1 in columns three and four, central, minus 9 and minus 9. And in Q3 and Q2, those columns three and four, minus 2 and minus 3. Stock compensation, minus 7 and minus 6, and then minus 1 and minus 2 in Q2. Mind you, it's always higher in Q1, because we do our big total company, total employee, those that get RSUs grant in October. Other, plus 8 and plus 8 last year, again, that was a year-over-year unusual item, I believe, and 0 and 0 in columns three and four. You add it all up, on a reported basis in Q1 2017 it was higher year-over-year on a reported basis by 16 basis points, and without gas deflation by 13. On a reported basis, in Q2 2017, we were lower or better by 5, and higher or slightly worse by 4 basis points, without gas inflation. As I mentioned the Citi Visa impact to SG&A in Q1 was 25 basis points - that's in those numbers, and 24 basis points in Q2. I won't go through the numbers, I just mentioned. My apology for doing that in reverse order. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense came in, I mentioned at $31 million. And I also mentioned that, come March 15, we're going to save about $0.08 a share or $50 million pre-tax net, $60 million reduced interest expense, and roughly about $10 million pre-tax reduced interest income. I was just getting ready to talk about the next line item on the income statement, the interest income and other, it was lower year-over-year by $20 million in the quarter. This year in the quarter, it was a minus $4 million number. Needless to say, it's the other, not the interest income, and last year, it was plus $16 million. Actual interest income and other, other than the FX that I talked about earlier for the quarter, were better year-over-year by $6 million. Offsetting this, of course, was that $26 million in charges related to various FX items that I discussed at the beginning of the call. Overall pre-tax income was lower by 4% or $32 million in the quarter, coming in at $809 million, versus $840 million - $841 million a year ago. I mentioned earlier in the call, income taxes, a little higher rate, coming in at 35.6% this fiscal quarter, versus 34% last year. We think for the year, our current best guess or effective rate for the year is actually lower than that - a little lower than that 35.6% that we recorded in Q2, probably somewhere more likely in the 35.3% or 35.4%. That's our best guess. Overall, reported net income came in at $515 million, compared to $546 million net income last year in the same quarter. A quick rundown of other topics. The balance sheet is included in the morning's press - in this afternoon's press release, and a couple of balance sheet items that we try to give out. Depreciation and amortization for Q2 totaled $312 million for the quarter, and $609 million for the first half of the fiscal year. In terms of AP ratio, accounts payable as a percent of merchandise - as a percent of inventories, 92% reported, both this year and last year. If you take out non-merchandise payables for construction and other things, this year it came in at 82 AP ratio, and last year it was 83, I was just rounding down a little there. Average inventory per warehouse came in at $13.1 million, compared to $12.8 million a year ago, or up about $350,000. Variances, about a little over $100,000 of it's health and beauty aids and the like, over-the-counter items. And some of that has to do with the timing of our MVM build up in February. Others are mostly non-foods, majors about $100,000, small electrics about $75,000, and hardware about $50,000 to $60,000, so nothing terribly out of pocket there. In terms of CapEx, first quarter, we spent $670 million. In the second - I'm sorry, in the second quarter, we spent $515 million. In the first quarter, we spent $670 million, so total year-to-date, $1.185 billion. We estimate for the year, CapEx will still be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. So $1.5 billion to go if you will - a $1.5 billion-plus to go. Next, Costco online, we're in the US, Canada, UK, Mexico, Korea and Taiwan, Korea and Taiwan being the most recent additions, about a year ago. For Q2, sales and profits were up, of course. Total online sales were up 12%, and up 11% on a comp basis. As I spoken about a little bit, probably in Q4 last year, in October, and then in - a fiscal quarter ago, back in early December, we continue to improve our offerings, merchandise offerings, and enhance our member experience online. In terms of improving merchandise, we continue to add new and exciting merchandise, and we continue to improve in-stocks on high velocity items. In terms of recent initiatives, and recent online additions include Samsung appliances, and a variety of added apparel brands, both direct and indirectly purchased, with additional offerings in various non-food categories in the coming months. These would include Kohler bath and kitchen, Reebok mens and women's active wear and footwear, and Spyder Ski and outerwear, to name a few. We've also continued to add various health and beauty aids, both regular ones and upscale ones, and sundries items to our online offerings, increasing both online page viewing, and member shopping frequency as well. One recent fun item to note, leading up to Valentine's Day, we offered online 50 long stem roses for $49.99, and that included delivery. We had sales in those three days of over $2 million, represented over two cargo planes, and most important, that $49.99 price point for 50 long stem roses is $30 less than what we sold the same item for just a year ago. And if you're late to getting those roses, we are now offering them at $39.99 including shipping. In terms of improving experience and functionality of the site, we've improved search, we've shortened the check-out process, and we've improved our member's ability to track their orders, and we'll continue to do some more of that. Just recently, we automated much of our returns process, not only providing members a much better quality of service, but also reducing by more than 20%, in just the first couple of months, our call center volume related to returns. There will be more to come, over this coming calendar year in several of these things, and we're finally getting around to doing some of those. Lastly, we continue to improve our distribution logistics. For example, in the US and Canada, we now fulfill online orders from 11 depot distribution points, which, of course, allows for closer and fast delivery of online orders. Overall, as I mentioned, we have plenty of online initiatives going on, both in terms of member experience and service, expanded products, and services offerings, and a greater value to the member. Finally, a quick update on other home and office delivery sales channels. As you know, we partner with Google Express in five cities, operating out of 15 of our Costco US warehouses. In addition, we're working with Google Express on a new service offering one to three day shipping of products throughout the Continental United States. We also continue to work with Instacart. Instacart currently operates in 26 US cities, in our case utilizing 132 of our US locations, and we are either testing or getting ready to test two other third-party delivery services within the next month or so. In terms of expansion, in Fiscal 2016, last year, we opened 29 net units, about 4.5% square footage growth. This year, it looks like it's going be also 29 net new units, so about 4.25% square footage growth. The planned Fiscal 2017 locations, these 29 locations by country, would be 14 in the US, 8 in Canada, and 1 each in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico, and then the new ones in France and Iceland. As of Q2 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 105.1 million square feet. Next in terms of stock buybacks, as you recall, in Q1 we repurchased $122 million or 809,000 shares of Costco stock for an average price of right around $151 a share. In Q2, we repurchased $66 million or 411,000 shares at an average price of just under $160, $159.86, I believe. In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend continues to stand at $0.45 a share. And on a quarterly basis, this $1.80 per share annualized, represents a total cost to the company of right at $800 million. Lastly, I want, before I turn it back to Frederica, our Fiscal 2017 third quarter scheduled earnings release date for the 12_week period ending - our third quarter ending May 7, will be - we'll do that after the market close on Thursday, May 25, with the earnings call that afternoon at 2 PM again. With that, I'll be happy to open it up to Q&A. And Frederica, I'll turn it back over to you for that process. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Hi Guys, it\u2019s Simeon. So Richard, I think the big question that will come up a lot, it looks like - I'm not in front of all of the numbers - but margins in this quarter sequentially versus Q1 seemed like they got a little bit weaker? And I'm excluding some of the gasoline impact, which granted, I don't think was fully captured. Is there anything changing as far as investment back in the business, SG&A dollars, eCommerce, or just reinvesting back into price, that we aren't seeing? Richard Galanti : Well certainly, the gas inflation does have an impact, as well as the increasing sales penetration of gas. That's probably as much of an impact. Certainly, as some of the more promotional stuff we did with everyday low pricing, had an impact. I didn't bother to try to quantify it because it's lots of different items and that's what we do. If anything, we did it a little more because we wanted to. There's been some other things going on, nothing major though. We really - I look at the numbers and I don't see a big change other than the things I mentioned, and perhaps what I mentioned about that. As Bob is reminding me, and getting back to the gasoline comment, a lot of it has to do with the contribution penetration of these areas. With gas inflation - I think gas prices are up 29% over the year, and gallon comps were up higher as well because of that. We're higher because of what we do, we have good prices, that had probably a bigger impact. Gas is typically, these are rough numbers, 800 or 900 basis points lower than the rest of the merchandise that we sell. It could be 700,000, but it's big and you have increasing penetration of that. So not only were gas margins down with rising gas prices within the gasoline business, but the impact that it has - and again if you get back to what I mentioned on the core margins, on their own sales, which is roughly 80% of our sales - food and sundries hard lines, soft lines, and fresh foods. On core margins year over year in Q2, they were up seven basis points, but the contribution, if you will, to the total here was minus seven. Simeon Gutman : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. I guess my follow-up - just thinking about reinvestment rates in the business, you have a membership fee increase coming down the pike at some point, and now we know when and there's a lot of debate on how much flow through or not. I guess, maybe the way to ask it is, is there a natural run rate of reinvestment that you as managers of this business try to put back in? And where are we running relative to that? I'm trying to gauge when we get the membership fee increase, are we going to see that getting pushed back into price as well? Or some of that will come through to the bottom line? Richard Galanti : My view is - I'm speaking historically here, that roughly we've done increases about every five years. And we're certainly not smart enough to figure out how to put it in over the five years. We know it hits the membership fee income line over about two years. We also know it hits very little in the first month, one-twelfth of the one-twelfth of the renewals, if you will. Historically, we've generally taken - we've invested in a lot of things, including continuing to invest in price, which might even be a slight negative then. Arguably, we've chosen, with some of the revamping of the MVM and some other things we're doing with everyday low pricing to, if you will, do some of that now. And that really is, in my view, not directly related to if, when, and now - when not if - a fee increase. But I would argue we probably did a little more now. Certainly the reduced number of MVM days. Even in the MVM what we've done is basically gone out to vendors and worked with them. The goal for us, and them, is to drive sales. Basically, it's a better value to the member, which means it's a little more expensive both for the vendor and us. So, I would say in some ways we've started that process, or we always do that process, and you'll see when you see. But generally speaking, in my view it historically goes in over a longer period of time, not just those two years - the net of everything. Simeon Gutman : Okay thanks, Richard, good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good evening, thanks a lot for taking my question. Richard, presumably you're investing in price because you're seeing a more competitive environment? Can you quantify or at least qualitatively comment on how much more promotionally and competitively intense it is now than when you've seen it in the past, particularly around the time when you've raised your fees? Richard Galanti : Well, do you know what? We have a couple of senior merchants in the room with me shaking their head, and I concur. This is really not terribly related to that, to the fact that there's increased levels of competition. When we look at our direct competitors - notably direct warehouse clubs and certainly supermarkets on certain key fresh foods and sundries items - a lot of what you read about were some of the big box discounters and their investment in price which is formidable. Our view is that impacts and the competitors have to deal with that more directly, or supermarkets in the case of Wal-Mart, or Target, or whatever else. We really haven't seen a big change there and certainly this was not motivated by that. I think it more has to do with is over the last few years, you'll see some of the sales lift in some of the things that the MVM has been great for us for so many years, changing and this is an iterative process. If anything, just like we are ultimately, we are going to do the right thing for the long term irrespective of how it impacts now. We knew and we chose, but we don't give direction, we knew this was going to have some impact. Not a big impact frankly, but with having less days by going to some EDLP, it's what it does to drive sales. I don't know where else you can get in the country a 40-pack of half-liter water bottles for $2.99, down from $3.49. And we're driving units and we're driving a little traffic. And that's what we do and it's not because somebody else went down to that price. We look at some key items and how do we do this. And it has very little to do with either different - a change in the level of competition, or the fact we're getting ready to do a fee increase. We do that really somewhat independently. Michael Lasser : And just to quantify the impact of pricing, you've got a 16 basis point benefit to your gross margin from the credit card transition? It sounds like you invested all of that and more back in the everyday low price? Richard Galanti : Again, I think the same comment. We didn't say, hey, we've got this much back let's use it all, or let's use any of it. We really look at those independently. I think one of the comments I made on a Q1 call, which is the First Quarter that there was really some transparency of how big an impact and successful the new credit card has been, both in terms of improving, adding to our gross margin percentage and to reducing our SG&A percentage in terms of lower fees. We really didn't say, wow, that's so big, let's use it. We do what we are going to do on pricing and this is where the chips fell on that. I think one of the comments we made on the first quarter conference call is we're clearly - we were more lucky than smart that, that helped to offset some of the reductions in things and this is what we do. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is, the assumption is because you tend to skew higher on the socioeconomic demographic, or your membership base does, that you were not impacted by the delayed tax refunds in February? Do you think that's right? Or do you think there was some impact, and if so could you quantify it? Richard Galanti : Well, I can't quantify it, certainly. Historically, when we've been asked a similar questions about when there was issues with food stamp-it programs or things like that, or this, we generally don't feel we're impacted a lot at all. It certainly is not a positive but my guess is it's not very much of a negative either. I would lean towards saying not really a big impact at all. Michael Lasser : Okay, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JP Morgan Chase. Christopher, you line open. If your phone is one mute, please unmute. Richard Galanti : We can move on. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel. John Heinbockel : So Richard, when you think about the executive increase in particular, how much discussion was there? What you should do with that, in light of where your club competitors are, where prime is? And then, when you think about where that goes over time, what kind of things can you add, and obviously the 2% is a big benefit, what can you add to the executive that might, people might want, that could allow that to continue to go up over time? Richard Galanti : Again, first of all, what we do best is value to the member on products and services, and certainly that's going to be part of it. As it relates to enhancing both the primary membership, and more importantly the Executive Membership, I will say - and not being cute - stay tuned. We've got other things we're planning to do, nothing's Earth-shattering, but several things we'll do, including, I'm sure one late summer or early fall. But so we'll continue to do that, and we'll continue to look at the value proposition on the credit card. As I mentioned - I'm sure a year ago when it first transitioned to it - whatever we do, and certainly the credit card profitability and success has been better than we and our partners have felt and originally planned, we'll look to enhance that value over time. But that's not something you do until you're a couple years out to see where things trend out. We'll continue to be very good at driving value and getting you to say, wow. John Heinbockel : Was there, again, when you think about what you could have done with Executive, was there any serious consideration to leave it alone, enhance the value proposition, and push more people toward Executive? Or you pretty much knew you wanted to do the $10 from the beginning? Richard Galanti : Well, I think we always start with the premise that we pretty much knew that. We look at other things as well, and we'll see what happens in the future. Nothing will happen in the next year or so I'm sure, but there are some other reasons in the state of California that it makes sense as it relates to sales taxability. We're pretty simple and it works for us. We're pretty simple and pretty extreme in terms of value. And we always look at, we always talk about, what about another level of membership above that. If we ever figure out how to just offer only Executive, we aren't there yet. But rest assured there will be more value-oriented things coming to the Executive for sure over time, and more value to all members and general pricing and things. John Heinbockel : Just one last thing. When you look at KS, assortment over time here, so it's clearly grown, looks like maybe up 50% over the past five years or so? That's imperfect, because there's stuff that cycles in and out. But when you think about where that ends up, three years from now, five years from now, obviously your total assortment is staying somewhat the same - are we going to get a higher percentage of KS items, just continuously, almost forever? Richard Galanti : Sure. I think yes, but we also, our success has been based first by selling branded goods at the best value out there. Two reasons, one such sharp savings relative to everybody else and two, our KS - if it's as good as, if not better quality, which is our starting point and even a greater savings versus what we sell the brand for, that's even better. And it keeps our members happy and it keeps us and our vendors honest. We'll continue to drive it. Recognizing there aren't a lot of $300 million and $500 million items out there, like the waters and the paper goods, and the K cups and whatever. But there's lots of $20 million and $30 million and $50 million items - we get surprised every day. So yes, there will be a continued push for that, but there's also a continued push to add brands that historically haven't been prepared to sell us. John Heinbockel : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matt Fassler : Hello Richard and good afternoon. A couple questions. First of all, just to make sure we understand the magnitude of the impact of the change in the MVM and the move to EDLP - when you talk about EDLP, are you solely talking about stepping in and displacing the MVM? And is there a way to estimate the impact that might have had on margin? And does that impact get - grow or dissipate next quarter as the disparity for the MVM comes down? Richard Galanti : It really, yes and no to each of those parts of those questions. We've tried some items using the MVM as example. Some with vendors we've chosen to go to EDLP and get out of the item, get out of the MVM. Others we go the other way. Sometimes it works one way and sometimes it works the other way and that's how you figure that out. Again, not to be smug, but we really don't see it as, yes small basis points impact $25 billion, $29 billion quarterly sales figures by a lot. But we really - as probably, we knew it was going to impact us this quarter. We don't provide direction, so we really can't say anything. It should improve a little in the next quarter, but it's not that's not based on, oh, my God let's change it. It's just that's what happens. Matt Fassler : And is the improvement based on the better sales that you're likely to get from the MVMs year-over-year or some other element related to the change you're making? Richard Galanti : It's all of the above. Including - as we've only done this for a couple of MVMs here - so a subset of all of the vendors over the years that have participated in this with us. Some that participated with us all the time for 22 years, and some are in and out and seasonal and some are new. And as we see the things that work, we certainly don't keep that a secret, and we go to our vendors. And we have vendors in some examples that are wanting to do more for us, wanting to get those prices even lower because they see the lift impact on it. It really is all of the above, and I joke and use the word a little it's a little strategy, because we are merchants and we try a lot of different things, and we're pretty good at figuring out what works and what doesn't and working with our vendors to do that. Matt Fassler : And one quick follow-up. Where are we right now in the credit card benefit cycle for you, are there elements associated with Citi Visa? Whether it's sign-ups, whether it's outside sales, and the financial benefits they have to you - that would lead to the financial benefit to you to ramp up? Or are we kind of leveling off at what's likely to be sustainable? Richard Galanti : Well, I think there was some benefit in Q4, but not big enough to actually separate out. The Big Kahuna was in Q1, where we reported it, and now it's Q2. So again, very simply, my guess is sometime you'll get some benefit, incremental benefit in Q4 to get the other half, if you will - it's not exactly half of that. In addition though, there's probably a little more in Q4 because of some of the challenges of the conversion itself. And then beyond that, I think I've said occasionally, that it should and hopefully will be the gift that keeps on giving a little, as we drive more penetration both in Costco with the 2% component reward on that, along with the 2% Executive Member reward. And it will drive outside spend because of the fact the card is accepted at so many places.  And if we can get you to use it everywhere or most everywhere, particularly those small merchants that generally pay higher fees to everyone, there's a component of that we benefit from. There's no way to predict what's going to happen. On a year-over-year comparison the biggest bang for this buck is over the first 12, maybe first 15 months, because the first 8 or 10 weeks had the challenges of the conversion. Beyond that there should be incremental benefits, but certainly not as big as the first year. Matt Fassler : Alright, thank you so much. Richard Galanti : By the way, at some point two or three years out, I'm guessing you're going to see - when we get comfortable and see where it goes - you're going to see enhanced improvement, because that's what we do, on even the reward proposition. Matt Fassler : Thank you. Richard Galanti : Both ours and our cards. Matt Fassler : Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Tiffany Kanaga : Hi, this is Tiffany Kanaga on for Paul. Thanks for taking our questions. I know you've gone through all of the numbers in quite some detail, but can you help us understand a little better as we're lapping quite a significant deleverage in core SG&A, excluding gas, so we didn't see the leverage this quarter that we hoped for, can you walk us through what might have held back the core SG&A line, ex-gas this quarter? And how to think about it going forward as we continue to lap even greater deleverage? Richard Galanti : Well, I mean, at the end of the day it's mostly, as it always is, payroll and benefits. Healthcare is inflationary. We still have bottom-of-scale increases that we've done. That was actually in March of last year, when that will anniversary, mid-March. So that hurt us a little bit. Again, we look to the numbers. I think, we always look in the mirror at each monthly budget meeting and say, could we have done a little better on controlling labor in the warehouses, controlling overtime hours - sure. And there's probably a few basis points that we could do better on. But for the most part I think it's the underlying comp. And mind you, using that, again, some of the example of the water going from $3.49 to $2.99 and sell a lot more units. The margin dollars are plus or minus the same, but there's more labor involved. Not a lot more but again all these things are incremental - add a few basis points. So other than that, the big one of course is all of the modernization-related stuff as we've had these big systems come on - it's like building a building. You build it and then you wait until you open it, if you will, or turn it on. And that's when you start to amortize it. In our case, typically over five and seven years. Sometimes three on a few things. And some of those big nuts, if you will, have occurred in the last year. Tiffany Kanaga : Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Hi, good afternoon. I too, wanted to drill further into the margin. So just to be clear, and I know you discussed this a lot today, Richard. If I'm looking at my model, year on year gross margins were down, ex-membership fees down by 24 basis points. So that's the first time in a while, at least in several quarters, that it\u2019s been down. So the shift from MVM to EDLPs is a significant portion of that? Richard Galanti : I'm sorry, ask the last part of the question - somebody was saying something here. Brian Nagel : The question is, and I know this is a bit of a [indiscernible] because others asked more questions. But if I look at - the gross margin, ex-membership fees, here in the fiscal Q2 were down 24 basis points. And that's the first time, as I look back sequentially, I'm not saying now, but they were down. And so how much of that, we look at the break in trend then, how much of that can be explained by this shift from the MVM to EDLP? Richard Galanti : I would say if there were five factors, I'm making this up, it's probably the third or fourth most impactful. And the biggest single factor, which is well more than half of the factors in total, is gasoline. Gasoline impacts it two ways. One, you have potentially lower margin on gasoline profits - or gasoline sales, and two, you have increasing penetration of gas because of a 29% higher price per gallon.  And this is a business. I don't know the exact number in my head, but roughly 10% of our total company sales. It's ranged from 9% to 12% or 13%. So that alone, again, if I go back to Q2, if we look again on a reported basis, lower by 24 basis points, ex gas inflation minus 15, but that minus 15 includes minus 18 - most of ancillary, most of which is gas. And so that's where a lot of it is. Brian Nagel : Okay, and then just on the ship and EDLP, is it fair to assume that when this is implemented, it could have more of a near-term impact by margins than maybe, say it takes awhile for sales to catch up - and I'm thinking because the MVM to a certain extent [indiscernible] so if you shift to an EDLP, maybe you lose that caller to action over time that figures it out? Richard Galanti : Couple of things here. First of all, it's not like we've changed this thing from - it's not binary, we aren't going from all this way to all another way. It is the transition quarter, and we did a bunch of stuff in that transition quarter. Again, that's in my view, one of the smallest factors relating to this decline in margins year-over-year. And the comment I made earlier to one of the questions on the call about what do we see going forward? I think Matt asked it, is that it should not be an issue. Yes, we'll see. But we don't believe it will be an issue in Q3 like it was in Q2. So, I wouldn't lose a lot of sleep at this juncture over that, and certainly not lose any sleep over the fact that we've made this major change. The major change is, we've changed it. And we're seeing the things and components of it that work and seeing some of the things we're tweaking. I think one of the reports out there that I saw couple days ago, talked about adding some days into the thing. No doubt have some friends in the vendor business. The comment I made earlier about Q3, whereas in Q2, on an 84-day quarter, there was 17 less MVM days. In the four-week month of February, 28 days, there were 11, 10 or 11 less MVM days. In Q3, and that 84-day month less a day or two for holidays, they are the same number of MVM days year over year. So again, I can't overemphasize that this is - EDLP is not a word we use a lot historically. We're trying a lot of different things and again, we think we feel pretty good about what we've got going forward here. Brian Nagel : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Oliver Chen : Hi, Richard. Thanks for the details on the roses too, I like that. Regarding the mailer and the changes historically, what were you seeing with the consumer in terms of the consumer insights that kind of drove you to engage in testing and reacting on the changes to the MVM program? And what are you looking for as it gets tested? As we model the membership fee increases, how do you think that will interplay with store traffic? Do you feel like store traffic will continue in the nicely positive range? Or will there be some volatility and risk we should think about going forward? Richard Galanti : First of all, as it relates to how and when we decide to change the MVM stuff. Not that we talk about this all the time, but for those who have known us, we talked for the last few years about how we tweak it a little bit. Ultimately over time, there's items that don't get these same annual - not only the same annual sales lift they historically have gotten, but also the additional incremental new potential customers to that given item, from the vendors perspective. It's not just getting somebody to buy more of something and consume more of something. It's getting new members to do it. So over time, some of those things, not all of them, some of them get stale. And we've done some tweaking over the last few years. Probably six months ago, three months ago, the merchants sat down with the operators and senior people there and made a choice to do what we're doing now. We knew, and we know it's the most painful in the first, in that transition quarter. Again, it's not in our view, and not to be cavalier about it, but it's not that big of a deal other than it did impact some things this way. And again, we continue to tweak it and so we're - unfortunately because small basis points make changes on EPS numbers and we sell it at a nice multiple, I recognize the concern. But we feel we've got a lot of good things going on and we're pretty optimistic about what's going to go on here in the upcoming quarters as it relates to driving sales and improving earnings. I can't give you specifics about how and why, but we're pretty, also good, as you know, laying out all of the stuff here, good and bad and so you can take a look at it. We don't look at this and see it as that big of a deal, and we have tweaked it a little bit and we have added a few more days back to some things. We knew also that again, Q3 was going to be a lot less of any of the negative impacts as it relates specifically to MVM days. Oliver Chen : And on the membership? Richard Galanti : I wanted to get back to the EDLP question, because again it's not an acronym in our vernacular, even though that's what we do, since the beginning of time. When we looked at these items and worked with different vendors on different items, sometimes it's, let's put a little more emphasis on MVM, change the pack size and do a greater value. Sometimes it's, get out of the MVM and do EDLP, and really come to the table with something that is a wow, on an ongoing basis. We've not just the last couple months but over the last few years, we've seen as we\u2019ve tried this occasionally, we've seen different things. And again, we feel good about what we feel that we are going to see going forward. We feel good about the lifts we've seen in many of the things. But we are by no means going to change everything to go to EDLP, which used to be MVM, by any stretch. We think the MVM has a lot of continued potential for us and by the way, there's some added benefits to it. Historically, in the last few years our MVM\u2019s - I believe there was three days between the MVMs and the warehouse. When you're talking about lots - one of the things that take up the most room and require the most operating issues in the warehouse. It's big bulk items like detergents and paper goods and water and the like. And logistically, we pushed that pretty hard over the years to three days. One, this gives them a little bit more efficiency in the warehouse. That's not the reason we did it, but that's an added benefit. Two, we've actually put some time in there to do a few other things in the warehouse. Whether it's road shows or some other things we've got going on with merchandise presentations. So, all of this relates only to what we do every day. We keep trying new stuff. It's not like, oh, my God something's changed. Oliver Chen : Okay, Richard, thank you. And what about your digital infrastructure, in terms of - is car pick-up and pick-up and buy online, reserve in store, as well as your mobile app, as well as thinking about the bricks and quick supply chain, what factors will be important over the next few years in terms of making sure you're driving ease, value, convenience as well as being superior merchants? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all - in terms of pick-and-click, no. Ask me next quarter, but I think the answer will be no for a while. You want to go see it in some of the other places, by the way. It ain't all that good. And we don't have the room for it anyway. As it relates - we are doing some unique things with business delivery, and we now have, whatever 15 or 16 business delivery sites around the US, just opening our first one in Canada. Probably the single biggest thing is what items we're offering online and how quickly we can get them to you. And I mentioned maybe a little bit of a teaser, but I talked about it online, you'll see more things coming this calendar year. Probably not until summer, that both what we're doing ourselves, as well as what we're doing with a couple third parties. Not only in our markets, but outside of our markets in the continental United States. One of the things we all know, we have the best prices on great quality items. And we've never been too good about worrying about how to get it to that end customer a day earlier. We're doing - it's the 80/20 with us. We've done just in the last six or eight months, a lot of improvement online in that customer experience, with the smallest amount of effort. The low hanging fruit. We've got good things working on, but we're doing these things, honestly, from our offensive standpoint not a defensive standpoint. And I'm not trying to be cute. Clearly we want to do it for competitive reasons, too, but it's not like we looked at this and we lost. We see our renewal rates, ex-some of that auto bill stuff that we believe. We see our traffic going up still, and we see online, we see our page views and the like going up as well. With some of the additional items and the types of items we put on and better communication to our members of what that is. I think again, sometimes we're viewed as the tortoise, not the hare. Certainly, over time we're viewed as being stubborn. I think in my view, we're a lot less stubborn and - but we're still a little bit of a tortoise sometimes and we got a lot of good things going on. We'll see, but stay tuned. Oliver Chen : And the last question, Richard, is on stores. A big topic is the physical stores. You obviously have really superior traffic and a great assortment, so what is your maximum store opportunity in the United States versus where you are currently? And are there any potential edits to the format or is it status quo in terms of what we should think about over the longer term? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, every year seems to occur that we think there becomes a few more locations than we thought were possible. Certainly in the last three fiscal years, in 2015 I think, we opened 21 in the US as an example. And 16 or 17 last year, and I think 17, I said this year. If you asked me five or seven years ago, I'd guess we would be down to 10 to 12 a year. Clearly we've gone to several new markets, new for us, not new for the warehouse club industry, where we've done well. Some of them are smaller and take a little longer but we're doing just fine there. I think we'll continue to add - the line will keep getting a little bit more towards that saturation, but a little slower than some might think. I mean, we don't know in terms of our basic 155,000-160,000 square foot format Costco warehouse in the United States, I think it's a good guess to assume that it will be somewhere in the mid teens for the next 10 years, per year. I don't know, three years from now I might be wrong, but at this juncture we doing a little higher than that which is a surprise to me. Canada, this year's an anomaly, opening 8 on a base of 91. But I can remember five or eight years ago, I don't remember how many we had, maybe 70. We felt one day the market potential for all of Canada could be 90. Now it's probably in the 110-120 range, but not 7 or 8 a year. This is unusual, but it's good for us. The opportunities present itself. I don't see us necessarily any time soon doing a unit half the size. We tried that a while back, not to say we won't try something. We began this year with 14 business centers all in the US. I believe we plan to end this year with 18, 1 of which is our first 1 in Canada. Could you have 40 or 50 in the US one day? We'll see. We had 8 for the first 10 or 20 years, for 10 or 15 years, before we opened a 9th a few years back. And so I don't know if the 2018 or the 2017 in the US, by fiscal year end will be 25 one day or 50 one day. But it's working and we'll see where it goes. And then the second and last thing - Oliver Chen : Thank you. Best of luck. Richard Galanti : Lastly, leg is international. Oliver Chen : Thank you very much, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Ben Shim : Hi. This is Ben Shim, in for Scott. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of questions. Can you give us an idea at this point what your expectations are for inflation? Are you inflating across some of your consumables categories, such as food and personal care products? Richard Galanti : The collective view is inflationary, or less deflationary, for the next few months and maybe a little inflationary, but it's a crap shoot. Ben Shim : Okay. Richard Galanti : I mean, it's based on SER buyers in different departments. There's nothing widespread at this juncture. Ben Shim : Okay, going to your historical experience with respect to membership fee increases, has 10% been the norm over the last several increases as far as attrition goes? Richard Galanti : I'm sorry what was the 10% related to? Ben Shim : I think you mentioned something like a 90% renewal rate over the last membership fee increase and I'm just wondering - Richard Galanti : Our renewal rate over the last many years has tweaked up from the high 80s to low 90s in the US and Canada. I mean there was a period of time for two or three years, that let's say three years over 12 quarters, it seemed like every quarter, year-over-year was up another tenth for a lot of reasons. Executive Members, as we convert them, they renew at a higher rate. Needless to say on a co-branded credit card, there is the benefit of auto billing for those that opt into that. You'll get a little higher rate there and hopefully we keep doing things to make you want to renew more. Ben Shim : Okay. Relative to five years ago when you had your last fee increase, can you describe what the competitive environment was back then if you remember and how it might be different now? Does it give you pause or concern? Richard Galanti : Absolutely no concern. Ben Shim : Okay. Alright, thank you very much. Richard Galanti : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Robby Ohmes from Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Robby Ohmes : Hi, Richard, I just quickly, was curious on an update of your business in China - what you're seeing on TMOL and if you're any closer to maybe opening a store over there? Thanks. Richard Galanti : We continue to - I think there was an issue with taxes that negatively impacted not only us but anybody selling, importing into China. There's a 10% increase in taxes. Boy, maybe somebody else shouldn\u2019t do that. But there's a 10% increase in taxes and that impacted again, negatively some of the imports into there. It's still relatively small. It's good, but it\u2019s relatively small. In terms of us opening in a location over there, you should expect something in the next couple years. Robby Ohmes : Got it, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Karen Short : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just want to go to the fee increase. I'm asking this because I'm wondering if you can give a little color on where your average ticket is with your Executive Members now, say versus 2012? Because when I calculate with the breakeven spending is off with this new fee, and when I try to kind of back into how many trips per week your Executive Member needs to be making, you're almost up to once per week to break, for that member to breakeven. I may be wrong on the math on the average ticket, so just wondering if you could give a little color on that? Richard Galanti : We don't give out those numbers, but directionally, I think one of your assumptions is, the average Executive Member spends a lot more per visit as well. And an Executive and a Business member, and more - relatively speaking, more of our Business Members or Executive Members, as a percent of total business members versus Goldstar, I'm guessing - I don't have the numbers in front of me - so all those things play. I want to also add a comment to a question a few questions ago about renewal rates, about how they've changed over time. I have a simple summary sheet here that shows what our renewal rates were. I only have US and Canada combined, which is again more than 80% of our company. At the end of 2005, it was 85.9%, at 2010 it was 87.7%, and at 2015 it was 90.6%, and at the end of 2016 it was 90.3%. That little delta downward has to do, in our view, with the conversion to the new Citi Visa card and some of the changes with automatic auto billing had to be redone. So sequentially its continuing to go in that direction. Recognizing it can't go above a hundred - and jokes aside it won't get that close, but we think that it\u2019s been consistently improving at a level that's consistently good for us. Karen Short : Okay and then just on eCommerce, you know I'm wondering if you could maybe give a little color on eCommerce growth rate by categories? And obviously your growth rate overall trails some of the mass competitors, so wondering, A, did it come in kind of in line with where you expected for the holidays? Or what do you think you could continue to do to drive that strength? Richard Galanti : I've shared I think a little bit of the kinds of things we're doing, from member experience, to faster delivery, to expanding items, and arguably, letting our members know that we have it. Again, it started off years ago as limited big ticket items, hard to carry, hard to deliver, hard to install items, and we've added to that. We feel again, fine with where we are. Yes, there are bigger increases out there, but I would bet that the investment per dollar of increase is dwarfed everywhere else. I'm not trying to be cute about that because we are investing more in it, but doing it in an offensive rather than a defensive way. We still are a brick and mortar entity and we want to get you into the store because you're going to buy more in the warehouse. You're going to buy more when that happens, and we've got a lot of reasons for you to do that. We also recognize we don't want to lose the sale to somebody else because they only buy online. I think, I feel you're going to see good things continue over the next few years. It's a small, online is a small percentage of our Company, 4%, $4.5 billion or so. Still a $4.5 billion business growing in the low, well, 11% or 12% this past fiscal quarter, and the mid-teens over the last few years in general, and I'm betting that will go up some from that level, but we have to see. Karen Short : Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Sean Naughton from Piper Jaffrey. Sean Naughton : Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to go back to the merchandise margin, the core merchandise margin, up 7 basis points in the quarter, just on a rate basis, just - this has been going on for a couple years now, and is it really driven by mix or is it some of the fewer promotions you were kind of describing or better deals from your vendors - just trying to understand how this line item has just been a very consistent march higher and is that intentional by Costco? Richard Galanti : First of all, it is intentional by us. My guess is that most of it is related to mix. I mean this quarter a little bit is related to the EDLP and MVM shift or whatever, but generally speaking, and certainly over the years, increasing penetration of gas. I mean you've got a total company gross margin last year of approaching 12%. If roughly 10% of that's gas at, quarter-over-quarter.  Oh, that's right. I think that's just the nature of the draw that quarter. Fresh foods tends to be a little higher margin, and I think it was down a little bit this quarter. Some of that has to do with holding prices on some deflationary items. A couple months ago, there was a bad berry crop. Literally, these are the kind of things that will impact us when we are such a big player in this stuff. I don't think any big difference here. Sean Naughton : Because it seems to me, and I'd have to look at the model again, this has been a number that's been very consistently going up between 5 to 15 basis points almost every quarter for the last probably 10 quarters? But maybe just mix related? Richard Galanti : Well no, quarter-on-quarter is not mix related. It's quarter-on-quarter. Sean Naughton : I'm just saying like it was in the core. Yes. Richard Galanti : Okay, I'm sorry I misunderstood part of the question. I think part of that is some of the aspects of the components of that. Some of the higher margin categories would be some of the non-food categories like apparel. For those who have known us for awhile, the last three years we've enjoyed probably an annual compound growth rate in our apparel sales in certainly the high singles, maybe 10%. So that's a category that's a higher margin to start with. I think we've done a little better job in some of the other areas of non foods, but apparel is the one that stands out in my mind as a big example. Fresh foods overall has a higher margin and even though it fluctuates up and down quarter over quarter of its own accord, if you will, it's a higher average margin department and penetration overall. Sean Naughton : Okay got it. And then just on new sign ups and renewal rates, I know Millennials are becoming a bigger piece of the store, and I think Craig mentioned something like 44% of new sign ups are actually Millennials now? Can you talk about how the Millennials are doing in terms of their renewal rates, just overall? And then I guess as an add-on there, is any color on the renewal rates for some of the promos that you've experienced or experimented with over the last couple of years on Living Social, or in social media, how the renewal rates from those programs have gone? Richard Galanti : Yes, I can't tell you how, like the age-group called Millennials today and how they renew and spend versus 5 years ago - whatever they were called, or 10 years ago in Gen Y or Z whatever it was back then. We didn't look at that kind of data back then. We have for the last couple of years, so ask me in three years and I'll have good information for you on that. What we see though, in terms of that age-group now called Millennials, it's not that different relative to the other age-groups today than it was two or three, and four years ago, when they signed up. What we see is - we only have two good data points on the two Living Social things we did about two and a half years ago, and a little over a year ago. We compared them to everybody else that signed up that month by just walking in or going online to sign up. What we found is due to Living Social, and I could be off a few percentage points here, on Living Social, it was about in the mid 40% range of those that signed up on the Living Social promotional effort that were Millennials. And that compared to the walk-ins that was in the mid 30%, maybe 9 or 10 percentage points difference. What we saw in terms of how much they spend over the course of the year, the Living Social - or the Millennials spent a little less each time and actually shopped a little more frequently, which is counterintuitive to me. And in terms of renewal, they renewed about a percentage point or two higher than the walk-ins in that first year that they had to renew. Again, a little counterintuitive to me. Maybe it is not statistically meaningful because again, this is its first year, it's one or two percentage points. But at least it gave me comfort personally, that we're not losing them and they are coming in. What we've also seen, and what we believe, when I look at the curve of who spends the most at Costco, it's the - they start spending - the peak is, if I separate people from 25 to 80 years old in 11 age-groups, the peak is the fifth and sixth age-groups, which are 45-49 and 50-54, and a nice increase going from 35-39 up to 40 and 44 before that. Well, might be that makes sense. Maybe they are getting married, maybe having kids, maybe getting married later having one less kid, who knows. But once they do that, then they start making more money, they spend more. They have more mouths to feed and they are making more so it's again, this is looking at a chart, not doing a lot of statistically significant analysis. Sean Naughton : That's helpful. Last quick question from me. When should we expect the golf ball back in stock? Richard Galanti : The golf ball back in stock? Stay tuned, when we have it, if and when we have it back, we'll let you know. Sean Naughton : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky : Good afternoon, got a question because what you said about the MVM is counterintuitive. You're very focused, Richard, always on growing frequency of visit, and it sounds like by reducing the days there is the opposite? How do you communicate the other factors you don't advertise to the member about road shows and new excitement or lower prices on certain key items you're trying to feature? Richard Galanti : First of all, how we do it, it's the Costco Connection, or magazine. E-mail and in-store sites but I've got to tell you we started this during the, Heard First, if you will. This goes back over a year ago when you start talking to vendors and our key merchandise partners and figure out what we can do and how we're going to do it. It wasn't like we need to get every reduced day filled with something else. Giving a little breathing room to the warehouses has been a big positive from our operator standpoint, and again, we'll see how that goes. I don't think it was a big surprise. We knew we would get impacted on the traffic side. And we know - one of the comments, I mentioned, and one of the comments some of you guys have mentioned or heard through others, is there have been a few extra days added to the starting point. Well, that's correct. If we look back out in the next three or six or nine months, the big extreme transition was this quarter, and in particular February, and you won't see that in Q3 as the same number of days. We'll stay more fluid in the next two to three quarters. And then it's just anniversarying stuff. Q - Sean Naughton Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Hi, thanks for fitting me in. Just wanted to ask about the decision to raise the dollar impact for the 2% reward? I was just curious if you tested that, that increase to a thousand? Or if you have any thoughts on what kind of impact you think that could have on traffic or ticket from that Executive Member? And then also, I guess associated with that, how we think about just the impact to gross margin as that flows through over the next several years? Thank you. Richard Galanti : Well first of all, there's a lot of Executive Members. In theory, even assuming the new fee structure of $60 and $120, that $60 means you've got to spend what, $3,000 more a year to be breakeven on it on eligible purchases. That's not a big hurdle, but there's plenty of Executive Members that don't get near the $750. So there's some that won't be impacted at all and others, a nice impact. How we came to $750 to $1,000 is not unlike how we decided to do $5 and $10 each five or six years and how we went from $500 to $750 last time. I think again you'll see other things that will add to the benefit, we continue to have added things to the Executive benefit. Our family bought a Yukon Denali a couple years ago. If you were a regular member, on top of getting incredible pricing on the car, a regular primary member we got, I think $200 or $300 cash card, and Executive Member got a $600 or $700 cash card. Needless to say, that incentives people to become an Executive Member. Once they are, they look at other rewards and there's plenty of things out there we'll continue to add to that. How it impacts margin - the extra $250 is relatively small, very small, relative to the 35 million people paying $5 and $10 each. Mind you, some of those are Canadian dollars, that's lower relative to the US dollar but nonetheless a very small piece of it. Kelly Bania : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Peter Benedict : Hi Richard, quickly, when you pay down the debt later this month, your leverage ratios drops pretty dramatically, just what are your latest thoughts around leverage? And if you care to comment on the circus in Washington and what's going on there, is that impacting your decision on when you might do something around leverage? Thank you. Richard Galanti : Clearly, as it relates to all of the proposed tax things, one of which is the ability to not write-off interest expense, that is not one of the ones we're worried about. We don't have a lot of interest expense. As it relates to our balance sheet leverage, we like to think of ourselves as well capitalized, not over capitalized. We're cognizant of it and I'm again, not trying to be cute. We look at all of the components of it - regular dividend growth, special dividend stuff, stock buybacks, first and foremost ramping up expansion. We're cognizant of it, but again we aren't going to just do something because this is March 15, and we got to do something. Again, stay tuned we'll - our Board meeting meets regularly every quarter, and we just had a Board meeting a few weeks ago and didn't do anything different. We're constantly asking questions about, are you going to increase the regular dividend, do another special. Stay tuned. We look at it every quarter and we decide what we want to do. But at this juncture, we basically use cash to pay off that debt, and I'm happy it's the most expensive piece of debt that we have. Peter Benedict : Sounds good, thanks, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Edward Kelly : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Richard, just looking at gross profit dollar growth, I know there's been a lot of talk about margins, but gross profit dollar growth this quarter slowed relative to where you were last quarter? Is that primarily fuel? Asking another way, did you make less in profit per gallon in fuel this year than - or less in gross profit dollars in fuel this year than what you did last year? Richard Galanti : I'm guessing we did, because when prices go up, we make less per gallon, period. And I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but let's face it, what was it, $0.06 a share of 42 million pretax in the quarter year-over-year. That ain't all gallons. It's mostly profit per gallon. The vast majority is profit per gallon. Edward Kelly : Okay, so as we think about - obviously the Street wasn't really modeling the quarter the way that it came out. And it's not as much about the gross margin, but it seems like it may be around this fuel side, with a bit of price investment on top of that? I guess, is that fair? And my question to you beyond that as we look out into Q3 as long as fuel prices are stable, does this headwind go away a bit? Richard Galanti : Bob, what did we do last year in Q3 on gas, was it still big? I think it won't be, all things be equal, in terms of the comparison year over year Q1 and Q2 profitability in gas a year ago was outsized big. We were profitable in Q1 through this year, but again, comparison was a huge difference. Some of that outsized big became less outsized big in Q3. It was less in Q3, but we don't know what Q3 this year brings. My guess is it certainly won't - well there's no certainty to anything in life - but my guess is it will be a little less negative all things being equal. And the other? Edward Kelly : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks, I have a quick follow-up to that and another question. If you're thinking about penny profit, Richard, are we back in gasoline to where we were a few years ago? Or could there still be room to go down there? And then my other questions were on deflation. I think you mentioned in February it was about 50 bips less than in the second quarter? I'd love to know what drove that. And maybe a longer term question, if you just look at membership growth numbers, we had been running close to 7% and it's decelerated to about 5.5% the last few quarters. Could you help us understand why that is, and if it's just timing of clubs or what's at work there? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Greg, I hope you wrote down the numbers because a few people were whispering to me as you were talking - what was the first question? Greg Melich : First question was a follow-up on the gas profit, so basically are we - Richard Galanti : Yes, we've had about, I don't know if it's a year and a half or two years of outsized gas profits. Is it back to where it was before - two years of outsized gas profits. I believe so, I don't know if it's a little worse or better than the two and a half years ago, but certainly these last two years have been fun. Greg Melich : Got it. And then the other questions were deflation in February looked like it was not quite as bad, it was 50 bips less deflation than in the second quarter? Richard Galanti : Yes, that's year-over-year, so part of that is just when the relative timing of inflation was a year earlier in those respective quarters and probably a little of it is some lower pricing on some stuff. I use the water example. See, that item is a $300 million item and we did more sales. Bob is mentioning in terms of deflation, it was a little better in the quarter in Q2 versus Q1, but February was more deflationary than the whole quarter, relatively speaking, than the whole Q2 overall. Greg Melich : Okay. Richard Galanti : It is eventually going down, but I think again some of that has to do with pricing on our side. It's not just what the economists are telling us. Greg Melich : Lastly, on the membership growth, I know it can move around quarter to quarter, but if you look a few years ago, it seemed to run 7%-ish, give or take? And now it's more like 5.5% the last couple quarters, is that because we have more in fills, or how should we think about less membership growth, the same sort of club openings? Richard Galanti : Some of it's related to the cannibalization I mentioned earlier. When you open eight units in Canada this year, there aren't a lot of new markets. We have openings, we've had openings in the US where in a small new market - well, Tulsa was my extreme example, where through opening day we had 20,000 plus sign-ups. I remember in Tennessee in a new market we had 10,000 or 12,000, which is great. We could open a new unit in LA and have 3,000 sign ups and it's an awesome location because it's existing members shopping a lot more frequently because it's a lot closer unit to the members. They have always been members. The other thing that will affect that is international openings, particularly in Asia where we could have, during those 8 or 10 weeks, up through opening day where we do tabling activities, we've had openings of 20,000 to 50,000 - 20,000 to 40,000 sign ups in those several weeks. So having a few of those change and I don't know if that helps or hurts us, those are the things that are generally impacted. Overall, we feel we're still adding members. Some of the new markets we've gone into, Tulsa again was an extreme one, but we tend to do well in those. Greg Melich : Okay, great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Molly Smith with Bloomberg. Molly Smith : Hi yes, Molly Smith here from Bloomberg News, thanks for taking my question. Richard, I wanted to ask you about the prospect of the border adjustment tax and given that your cost of goods sold, about half of that comes from imports - so what have your thoughts been as these discussions continue? Have you tried to lobby with any of these other retailers against the tax? And as well as other changes potentially coming out of the new administration with healthcare, how that may impact your business as well, if at all? Richard Galanti : Sure. Before I answer that, just one final comment in response to Greg's question about the increased growth in new members - or actually, not members, but new members, but revenue. A little of that probably was negatively impacted by the auto billing comment I made about the credit card transition. A little bit, I don't know how much but that's probably a little bit of that offset too. As it relates to the border adjustment tax, there's clearly the people out there that want it and manufacturers that export a bunch of stuff and don't import a lot of stuff and at the very other extreme retailers. Recognizing border adjustment tax is just one element of one version of the tax reform plan that's been put forward out there. The probability of what's going to happen and when it's going to happen and how much of it's going to happen, we don't know. We don't believe it's good for consumers - it's going to raise prices and ultimately, I read articles where some retailers, particularly apparel retailers, were 90%-plus of their merchandise is sourced overseas, well a 20% tax is a 20% tax. While retailers generally tend to historically be full corporate taxpayers, us in the mid-30s in the US probably a little higher than that, the total company effective rate. It's going to hit it and so to go through, we personally don't buy into the fact that it will be offset by a big rising dollar. We don't know what's going to happen with the retaliation out there by other countries, and we'll see. But as a retailer, we definitely think that it's bad, and we're against it. We, in terms of lobbying, we aren't big on lobbying. We're doing a little bit of that area, certainly RILA, Retail Industry Association, is very involved in it. There's an offshoot organization forum which RILA is a big part of, and we become part of - the Americans for Affordable Products.  We\u2019ve joined that along with many, hundreds of retailers including some very large retailers. And through those lobbying efforts, we certainly support what they are saying and hopefully, those out there that will make these decisions are listening. We've spent our whole lives driving down prices, and recognizing also that so many items - it's not a question of - let's buy them here instead of outside of the US. They don't exist here and that's not going to happen overnight. So it will be a tax, ultimately in our view, and prices will ultimately have to rise. Molly Smith : Thanks so much, and anything on the Affordable Care Act either, or no? Richard Galanti : I'm sorry? Molly Smith : Anything else on prospects of change to ACA, if that impacts your healthcare at all? Richard Galanti : It really doesn't. We have a very good quality, rich, Medical/Dental/Vision and Other plan where our employees only pay about 10% of the total cost. It's one of the things that sometimes impacts our P&L a little bit, but something that we're very proud of, and so we really don't have a lot to say about that. Molly Smith : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group [ph]. Joe Feldman : Hi, guys. Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group as you know. Sorry to prolong the call, but just wanted to ask, could you share any thoughts on the service element of your offering? I'm thinking about like travel, and maybe like payroll tax, or doing different things, auto sales, and maybe how data mining could play into that? Richard Galanti : Well all those services, we tried to not talk about them a lot because we've got a lot of good things going on. They are profitable, they are growing, so many of you have heard me talk to you about, challenge you to go next time you rent a car, go to www.Costco.com and no matter how smart you think you are, and you'll see what a great value it is. We're doing better in getting that word out and you'll see additional services. As it relates to data mining, we're starting to take some baby steps in that area, but again our first and foremost is - we're pretty good at getting on the phone and calling third party people that we think can be a good partner to us. And we continue to look at other things, but those are all things that will continue to drive our business in a positive way, but I don't want to suggest we're hiring somebody to do big data mining at this point. We're doing more data analytics that we've ever done and there's plenty of low hanging fruit to start. Joe Feldman : Thanks, and one other question. Just on IT expenses, I know it\u2019s been a drag much of this year and presumably it never goes away given where we are headed with technology in general - but is that the right way should it annualize at some point and level off? Or should we think about incremental expense going forward? Richard Galanti : You know, about three and a half years ago when we embarked on this dark journey, recognizing we probably had the lowest cost IT out there. And I always joke we were in the greatest MASH unit. It was always up and running, but band-aided to death, and we made a big investment. We also during the process found out what we don't know, and what we need to do and again it's gone up. I think best guess four years ago was incrementally, it might cost in the low double digit basis points to SG&A. Mind you, every year, the denominator of that calculation, sales, keeps going up so it's rising. It's I think historically today it's probably in the mid- to high teens. It has gotten a little more outsized this year because some of the big programs have now been installed. Notably, the beginning of this first fiscal year as an example, our major accounting platform, which is the crux of a lot of things, we'll do on it now. That was $150 million that will then be amortized over seven years. We'll keep it longer than that but that's what we amortize over, so that's added to that thing. I think you'll still have incremental costs and the definition of modernization will evolve also, and we keep adding new things to it, rewriting the pharmacy system. There's additional things that we'll do, so I think it's going to be less painful going forward. This year is a double whammy, because you also have some things that impact sales downward. So that denominator hasn't grown as fast in that regard. I think it's still going to be a drag for a few years. Much less of a drag than it has been. Joe Feldman : Got it, thanks and good luck. Richard Galanti : Why don't we take two more questions. I think this is our longest call ever, and we're all, David, and Bob, and I are here to answer them outside of this conference. Operator : [Operator Instructions] There are no questions in queue. Richard Galanti : Well thank you very much, have a good afternoon. Operator : This concludes today's conference call, you may now disconnect.",

Baird Greg Melich - Evercore ISI  Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Samantha and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Samantha and good afternoon to everyone. I\u2019ll start by saying that these discussions will include forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today\u2019s press release, we reported our third quarter and year-to-date fiscal year 2017 operating results for the 12-week and 36-week periods ended May 7th. For the 12-week fiscal third quarter, our reported earnings of $1.59 a share or $0.35 a share above last year's third quarter reported earnings of $1.24.  As noted, in this afternoons release, the $1.59 reported EPS figure included an $82 million or $0.19 per share income tax benefit in connection with the $7 a share special cash dividend that the company declared on April 25th and which is payable tomorrow May 26th.  The realized tax benefit related to the special dividend payable to company's 401k plan participants as it is considered compensation to employees under U.S. tax law. There is about a little over 30 million Costco shares held by employees among our other investments in the 401k plan. In addition to this one time earnings benefit, here are few other items I would note, when comparing year-over-year results. Number one first, our co-branded credit card as well as the case in both the first and second fiscal quarters in this past year, the Citi Visa co-branded credit card program, positively impacted year-over-year margins by 16 basis points, and SG&A expenses by 20 basis points. And our overall bottom line in Q3, benefitted earnings by $0.14 a share. By comparison and I believe in Q1 and Q2 the numbers were up $0.01 or $0.02 less than that per share, but still significant as we are still in the first year of the program change. Number two, gas profitability, our profits from gas during the quarter as compared to last year's third quarter were higher by $37 million pre-tax or better year-over-year by $0.05 a share. Gross margin, last year's third quarter earnings included a $19 million pre-tax benefit from a non-recurring legal settlement and this represented an improvement of gross margin of 7 basis points year-over-year or $0.03 a share, which was in last year and not this year.  SG&A, this year's third quarter earnings included a $14 million or $0.02 a hit to SG&A this year related to two non-recurring legal items, so whereas last year had a benefit, this year had a detriment. IT expenses, as a percent of sales was actually flat year-over-year as percent of sales and in-line with sales growth during the quarter.  Number six, FX, the two FX items, as compared to year ago during the third quarter, foreign currencies where we operate were mixed relative to the U.S. dollar and our aggregate weakened versus the U.S. dollar most notably in Canada, the UK and Mexico and this resulted in our foreign earnings in Q3 where we convert back into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes being slightly lower by about $5 million or about $0.01 a share, then if the exchanges rates have been flat. Conversely we had a gain reflected in our interest income and other line related to forward FX contracts and U.S. dollar holdings by our international subsidiaries, we do that when they use to pay for U.S. dollar denominated merchandize payables. In Q3 that benefited P&L by $9 million or a little over a $0.01 a share year-over-year.  LIFO, there was no LIFO charge or credit in this year's third quarter results whereas last year in the quarter we had LIFO credit of $13 million reflecting deflation in our LIFO indices. That represented about a $0.02 a share benefit credit last year and versus nothing this year but we do have deflation. There is no LIFO reserve to draw from and essentially you can't go below zero. Income tax rate, as previously discussed, our third quarter tax rate was very favorable due to the treatment of the special dividend, as a result the reported tax rate in Q3 was 26.8%. Excluding the impact from the special dividend our normalized tax rate would have been 35.3% for the quarter. Turning to our third quarter sales, reported sales were up 8% and our 12 week total company reported comparable sales figure was up 5%. For the quarter, the plus five comp sales figure was helped by gasoline price inflation to the tune of about 140 basis points and offset or hurt from FX by about minus 60 basis points.  By segment the company increases were as follows; U.S. six, Canada two, international four excluding the impacts from gas and FX, the six in the U.S. would have been at five, the reported Canada of two would have been three and the international reported at four would have been a six, still totaling up to five overall. In terms of new openings, our opening activities and plans, we opened 12 net new locations during the first two fiscal quarters, the first half of the year; in Q3 we opened a net of two new units, three total and one [indiscernible], so including our 37th location in Mexico and our first business center in Canada in Ontario.  For all of fiscal 2017 we have current plans to open a total of 12 more locations, so 26 net locations for the year; of the 26 for the entire fiscal year 13 were in the U.S., six in Canada, on a base of 91, one each in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Mexico and Australia as well as our first openings both in Iceland, which occurred two days ago, on Wednesday and France coming towards the end of next month in June. This afternoon I'll also review membership trends and renewal rates, the upcoming membership fee increases plan for the U.S. and Canada, those become effective next week on June 1st. An update on the CV\u2019s Anywhere card program, additional discussion about our margins and expenses in the quarter. E-commerce results and the recent special dividend and related $3.8 billion debt offering that we completed recently. So starting with improve results. As I mentioned, sales were up at $28.22 billion, up 8% over last year\u2019s $26.15 billion in the quarter. Again, on a reported basis and on ex-gas and FX basis, comps were up 5%. For the quarter, our 5% reported comp figure was a combination of an average transaction increased of 2% and an average shopping frequency increased a little over 3% and as little over 3% is something wide and was the 4% just in the U.S. In terms of sales comparison by geography, Texas and Midwest regions were strongest, with Northwest, Southeast and California not far behind. Internationally, in local currencies, better performing countries the UK, Korea and Mexico. In terms of merchandise category sales for the quarter, for the third quarter within food and sundries and was up in the low-single-digits spirits, deli and candy were the leaders.  Tobacco continues to be a negative, and as we have mentioned in the last two to three quarters anniversary itself by the end of June the tobacco component. For hard lines, overall in the mid-single-digits, strongest department sales were in tires, hardware, and health and beauty aids. Our consumer electronics overall were down low singles. Soft lines also were up in the mid-single-digit range, with apparel, house wares and domestic showing these best results. And in fresh foods comps were up in the low-single-digits. Within ancillary, gas had great comps in the quarter aided by of course the higher sell price per year to $2.42 per share versus $2.08 a year ago, as well as strong comp gallon growth. In addition, hearing aids were up in the mid-teens in terms of comps followed by optical in the high-singles and pharmacy in the low to mid-singles. In the third quarter, the U.S. front-end basket. U.S. units were just under percentage point. Well average basket value was slightly positive. These results now standing they were still seeing a little deflation in the core business. Lastly, in Q3, the number of MVM promotional days, if they were to stay year-over-year in Q3 plan change from Q2 and year-over-year during the 12 weeks in the second quarter, they were 17 fewer in the MVM promotional days and as we have mentioned in the last call need to make changes. So the lack of promotional days wouldn\u2019t impact company as much as it had impact since the quarter. Moving to the line items in the income statement, membership fees reported came in at $644 million, up 4% in dollars or $26 million and down eight basis points as a percent of sales. FX had a low to do with the dollar increased and also the number of new openings year-over-year in the quarter. In terms of membership, we continue enjoy strong renewal rates 90.2% in U.S., Canada 87.5% worldwide on a fully capture basis and we continue to see increasing penetration of the executive membership and those companies where we offer that.  At the end of the quarter, we had $37.8 million Gold Start members, up from 37.5 million 12 weeks earlier at the end of the second quarter. This is primary $7.4 million, the same quarter-over-quarter for 12 weeks. Business add-on $3.4 million and $3.4 million. Household we had $48.6 million member households that for $48.3 million 12-weeks earlier. Notwithstanding the effect where we just had a few openings in the quarter. Total card holders, came in at the end of the quarter 88.9 million, up from 88.1 million at the end of the second quarter. Also at the end of the third quarter, paid Executive Memberships stood at 18.3 million, and increased during the 12-weeks of 345,000 new Executive Membership or about 29,000 a week increase in the quarter. Executive Members now represents about 38% of our member base, and about two-thirds of our sales closer to 70% of sales in those countries based on the countries where it operates. In terms of renewal rates, business members renewed and these members would be in U.S. and Canada which is about over 80% of our business. Business came in at 94.1% at the end of the quarter, down from 94.3% at the end of the prior quarter consistent with what we have seen in the U.S. as we are still in the process in first year of year-over-year from moving the card over to the new Visa Citi card.  Gold Star, remains both at second quarter end and third quarter end at 89.5 and its total was 90.2 both in the quarter end, so again we rounding, causing some of that, but those are the numbers 90.2 both at second quarter end and at the third quarter end. Worldwide, which includes the outside of U.S. and Canada actually and at the end of the quarter it was 87.5, we rounded up to 87.7 at the end of the second quarter, which had been up from 87.5 at the end of the first quarter.  Regarding the increases in annual membership fees in the U.S. and Canada these go into effect again next week on June 1st, recall that we had taken fee increases in several of other countries this past September for us is the beginning of our current fiscal year. Our primary membership will increase $5 to $60 and Executive Memberships will increase to $120 up $10. And with regard to Executive Membership the 2% reward caps associated with the Executive Membership is being increased from the current $750 per year level to a $1,000 per year level based on eligible purchases by these Executive Members.  In all, the fee increase impacts about 35 million member households will be impacted by it about half of whom are Executive Members and half of who are Primary Members, so $10 to $5. Note that the Membership fees are accounted for differed basis, so in terms of when it will benefits the membership fee income line of the P&L. The full P&L impact would be over 23 months timeline based on the fact that it's over the next 12 months that renewers will get their first increase and then it's differed over a year period from which from the time that they originally pay it.  Before continuing down the income statement a quick update and few updated stats on the Citi Visa card offering which began last June early in our fiscal fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Recall we would began last June with approximately 11.4 million co-branded cards which represented 7.4 million accounts that were transferred to city at the conversion.  As of Q3 end we now have about 1.5 million new approve member accounts, which represents about 2 million new cards since the last June 20th and that 1.5 million that represents about 290,000 additional accounts over the past 12 weeks since Q2.  And overall we are seeing the Citi Visa co-branded portfolio total spend higher year-over-year that both organically from cards converted to Citi last June and from these new accounts. In terms of the conversion the usage in this signs-offs the card I think as I said a quarter ago and a quarter before that so far so good. Turning down to the gross margin-line, gross margins reported were up eight basis points, I'll ask you to do a little metrics here, four columns, well there will be two columns for Q2 2017 and two for Q3 2017, column one will be reported to 2017 year-over-year, column two will be without gas inflation and then columns three and four again will be reported for Q3 2017 and then Q3 without gas inflation. Those would be the year-over-year basis points change.  The first line item is core merchandizing, in Q2 year-over-year was plus one basis points and ex-gas it was plus nine , and Q3 reported plus seven and ex-gas plus 20. Ancillary businesses, minus 20 and minus 18 in Q2 and the two columns of Q3 will be plus 15 and plus 19. 2% reward, zero and minus one, and then minus two and minus four, LIFO minus fives across the board, again having some deflation this year but comparing to credit deflation last year in the credit but nothing to credit since we are below zero there.  Other zero and zero in the two Q2 columns, and minus seven and minus seven in two Q3 columns, so all to all the year-over-year in Q2 we reported gross margins in Q2 down 24 basis points and ex-gas they were down 15, this year in the quarter there was plus eight reported and plus 23 ex-gas. Now if you take the numbers that I talked to you about on the benefit from the change to Citi Visa as compared to what it would have been had we had the old program. We benefitted as I mentioned by 16 basis points year-over-year in Q3, and I believe in Q2 we also benefited year-over-year by 16. So again if you just simply look at the total of just two Q3 here, the reported plus eight would have been minus eight ex that single benefit of the Citi Visa and the plus 23 would have been plus seven ex that, and that's how it shook out. Overall Q3 reported gross margin again as I mentioned was started by eight or reported basis 0.3% excluding, as I usually do I'll go through the core merchandize component which is about 80% of our sales, food and sundries, hardlines, soft lines and fresh foods, the core merchandize component gross margin was actually higher by seven basis points year-over-year and up 20 basis points excluding gas price inflation.  Excluding the benefits of Citi Visa, minus nine and plus four, so again the plus four excluding gas inflation will be the number if you look at here. I'm sorry, it's essentially wrong. The plus side it was what I really told about the whole company.  In terms of the subcategories at the core, food and sundries, hardlines, soft lines and fresh foods, as a percent of their own sales they were actually positive year-over-year in the quarter by 12 basis points, with food and sundries, and hardlines both higher year-over-year, our soft lines and fresh foods little bit year-over-year but net of all four under our sales was up 12.  Second, ancillary and other businesses gross margins were up about 15 basis points, about 19 ex-gas deflation, about two of theirs that year-over-year increase was due to higher gas profits as I mentioned earlier in the call, but even ex that the other ancillary businesses, that year-over-year were up a little bit.  2% rewards, minus two basis points and minus four ex-gas, that basically means more usage by numbers you get the 2% Executive Member reward into spend or more. LIFO I talked about twice already. And lastly the other that minus seven if you will is the fact that last year, that was an $19 million non-recurring legal settlement, which of course zero this year so it\u2019s a minus seven year-over-year comparisons. Overall, margins we felt were good, with solid results in the quarter to plus 12 basis points on core sales and gas margins again also positively contributing not only in terms of higher gross margin within the gas sales as well. Offset by negative year-over-year comparisons from LIFO in the one-time settlement from last year. Moving onto SG&A, our SG&A percentage in Q3 year-over-year was low or better by 14 basis points, and that plus 14 will be flat or zero without gas inflation, coming but plus 14 was basically 10.44 versus 10.30 last year. Again as I mentioned earlier, the benefit effectively lower fees related to taking new card versus our own program. Year-over-year would have been better by 20 basis points in those numbers are in here. So again, I will ask you to do a little metrics with the same four columns, Q2 2017 reported and Q2 2017 ex-gas and then Q3 2017 reported and Q3 2017 ex-gas.  In terms of core operations, reported into 2017, we were up 8 basis points, I\u2019m sorry better or lower by 8 basis points year-over-year, without gas better or lower by 1 basis point. And then Q3 reported lower or better by 21 and ex-gas lower better by nine. Central minus two and minus three, so that was higher by that amount year-over-year and minus one and minus three.  Stock compensation pretty much in-line with the sales, but it\u2019s always a big impact in the Q4, in Q1 what we do our big brand each year. Stock compensation was minus one and minus two or higher year-over-year in Q2, to two Q2 columns and minus one and minus one again a little higher in the Q3 columns. Other is zero to zero in Q2 in this two Q3 columns minus five and minus five and again that relates to the $14 million in the two legal items that we are non-recurring that impacted this year Q3. Also told, last year in Q2, SG&A reported was lower or better by plus five basis points and in natural gas inflation higher or slightly higher by four basis points. This year reported better by 14 ex-gas zero basically flat and again I\u2019ll just use the two Q3 columns. If you take out the benefit from the Citi Visa conversion and that was 20 of the 14 if you will so ex that it would have been higher or over minus six and again the zero would have been higher or minus 20.  Now excluding the Citi Visa Central year-over-year was higher by basis point reported in three without gas. Nothing unusual to quarter, depreciation expense was slightly higher year-over-year again stock compensation expense was a basis point higher and that other was minus five. Next on the income statement line. Pre-opening expense $3 million lower this year coming in the 15 million versus 18 million. Quite a few less openings, eight last year in the quarter and three this year and but that has to do timing of locations to all the pre-opening doesn\u2019t actually happen in the quarter, which the actual opening occurs.  And certainly this year\u2019s figure also include some of the pre-opening expense rate turn entry into two new countries Iceland and France. All told operating income in Q3 came in at 968 million or better by 110 million, which is 13% higher year-over-year. Below the operating income line reported interest expense came in at 21 million. Interest expense in Q3 this year is quite a bit of a lower improvement from last year's Q3 came in at 21 million as 9 million lower than last year reported $30 million for a year. Virtually all of it is due to the payments back in March of the our 1.1 billion, 5.5% fixed rate note that we as a [indiscernible] year note that we paid it off on March 15th, so that is about 60 million a year annualized interest savings since that end March 15th date. As we reported last week, we successfully completed a new debt issuances totaling 3.8 million and that was done in fourth tranches, there was an $800 million five year tranche and then three $1 billion tranches at five, seven and 10 years. The details of that can be found in the press release dated May 9th. [indiscernible] the new debt have the un-mounted rate of little over 2.6%. As well on May 15th we gave notice of early pay-off of our December 2017 $1.1 billion 108% notes and the expected pay-off date will June 15, 2017. Next line item on the income statement, interest income and other, it was higher year-over-year by $11 million coming in at 18 million in Q3 as compared to 7 million a year earlier. Now actual interest income for the quarter was better, but better year-over-year by 2 million. In addition we have benefitted by about 9 million I mentioned that earlier in credits mostly relating to the various FX items discussions and that I have discussed in the beginning of the call.  So adding these two line items, from operating income overall pre-tax income was higher by a 130 million or 16%, coming in at 965 million this year during 12 weeks as compared to 835 million a year-ago. Again in terms of income taxes our reported tax rate this quarter of 26.8% normalized that would be 35.3 and that compares to last year 34.2, and we would expect it to be in that 35.3-ish range for the year. Overall, reported net income came in right at $700 million and that's compared to our reported $545 million a year-ago.  A quick rundown of the other usual topics. The balance sheet as included in this afternoons release, a couple of quick items that I always go through that one of them that\u2019s not on their is depreciation and amortization for the quarter total $320 million and year-to-date $929 million.  One of the metrics we always look at is accounts payable as a percent of inventories as through the balance sheet came in at 97% it was 99% a year-ago in the quarter. We also take on all the non-merchandize payables and we calculate it so it's merchandize payables as a percent of inventories and that to came down two percentage points from 89 a year-ago to 87 so there is still a vast majority of inventories being trade balance. Average inventory per warehouse that was up $693,000, coming in at $13.4 million compared to $12.70 million a year ago, about almost that quite 40% of it was majors electronic, we are seeing a big shift and finally a big increase and particularly in TVs kind of the next generation of bigger more K and you name it as well as some other electronics areas.  Small increases in various other departments as well some buildup in inventories related specifically to our e-commerce as just in the last year we have gone from seven to 19 e-commerce fulfillment centers in the U.S. year-over-year, but many of those and mostly those are connected to our depot operations we not their building along the new warehouses just for that. In terms of CapEx, In Q1 , we spent $670 million. In the Q2 515 and Q3 538, so year-to-date we are at 1.723 billion. And overall for the year we'd probably be in the 2.5 to 2.7 range, probably it's maybe 100 less than we had estimated the quarter or so ago, just a couple as you saw in the number we are expecting 26 for the year, just a few delays nothing terribly different.  In terms of e-commerce we continue in the locations where we were 12 weeks ago, U.S., Canada, UK, Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, and we expect to do additional countries over the next one and a half or so years. For Q3 sales and profits were up, online sales were up 11% a quarter as well as comps at the same locations. Within the 12 weeks, we look at four week periods ourselves, that came net 11, represented 13 or 14 in the seventh, and the seven was weak in part due to the shift in both Easter, Mother's Day, but overall the number for the quarter was 11. We continue to improve our offerings, and enhance our member experience, we continue to add new areas of merchandize, improved in-stocks on high velocity items as evidenced by conditional inventories in those areas and more locations. In April, we launched something new GE Appliances along with their self services delivery schedule, it's starting off well, but again it's just started off, and we will continue to add additional names. In terms of online Kirkland Signature items, we recently launched Kirkland Signature maternity apparel, they have all so expanded from our KS groceries and consumable items on dot-com, and if you are in the mood for A4 Wagyu Center Cut New York Strip Steaks, we apparently have a great deal on four or 12 ounce steaks for $499.99. In terms of improving the experience functionality we have improved search, streamlined the checkout process both mobile and desktop, improved the members ability to track orders and Nevada made in much of the merchandize returns process.  Now, many people have that, we are newer to it, but we have done a good job I think in the last six to nine months of getting that member experience and functionality a lot better on the site. Overall good things are happening online and both in terms of member experience and expanded products and certainly the great value is to our members. We still want you to come into the warehouse of course. Next discussion expansion, as mentioned for the third quarter we opened three locations clearly one reload so net of two, quite of a lot openings in Q4, 12 total including Iceland just a couple of days ago. In fiscal 2016 if you recall we opened 29 units, so about 4.5% square footage growth, this year it was at 26 if it wasn't been delayed into the fall, 26 for the year that will be about 4% square footage growth, of the 26, half 13 are in the U.S., a quarter six are in Canada, and then one each in those countries that I mentioned earlier. And again of course this is our first locations opened to fans which is scheduled for I believe June 22nd and again Iceland just opened. Total square footage some of you asked about Q3 ended sort of 105.4 million square feet. In terms of buybacks in Q1 we brought back $122 million worth, Q2, $66 million, Q3, $45 million, total of $233 million of stock or 1.486 million shares at an average of about $156.5. Regarding dividends in addition to special dividend, we increased our quarterly dividend, that was announced also on April 25th. The new amount is $0.50 per share per quarter, so $2 a year, that's up 11% from the prior $0.45 a share and again that will be also be paid tomorrow on May 26th or 56 quarterly amount. The $2 a share annualized dividend represents a total annual cost of company of about just under $900 million. And as I mentioned earlier, the $7 share driven that will be paid on to shareholders tomorrow as well. Lastly, our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter scheduled earnings release date and this is for the 17-week this international week in the year. For the 17-week fourth quarter that Amazon that is September 3rd, we will do the earnings release after the market closes on Thursday October 5th, with the earnings calls that afternoon it to get to be a pacific time. With that, happy to open it up for a questions-and-answers. And I\u2019ll turn it back over to Samantha. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel. John Heinbockel : So Richard, first topic expansion and business centers. So you have added some more there is couple of coming here in the next month or so. How do you think about business centers versus regular clubs number one? And when you think about is there a big potential business center expansion here. And then lastly on expansion when you think about, is it too early to think about 2018 and we sort of get back to 30 openings worldwide next year? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all with regard to the business centers, I think we started the year with 14 and signed up four this year so 18, that should be up by 1, and are first in Canada, we call that we had business centers for, I think we are going from four or five to seven or eight over about 10 plus years. And so we continue to be hit and news say we have found something that seems to work now and then there is a little method to that madness.  And but it\u2019s corollary to what our primary businesses is opening full Costco membership warehouses. And we were continue to open more, but I think again this is guess at this point. But on assuming the base at end of the year is 18 that should be up one using that two to seven or two to six or three to five, I mean, that will be in that range for the next couple of years. We are not looking to go from 14 to 18 to 28 in a year.  And so far so good, I think a couple of years ago, we said to ourselves one day that this would be since there would be 13 or 14 weeks who knows. I remember when we said years ago one day could we have 100 Costco's in the U.S. and we are approaching 500. So it\u2019s by no means, the same as it regular royal spot in terms of capacity a lot lower than that but I just look at more of general to the last couple of years and extrapolate that for the time being. John Heinbockel : Okay, and then and is it too early for next year? Can we think about... Richard Galanti : Surely, it's too early I mean it is I mean our goals will be to get towards that but it seems to be challenging this year and but we can work in towards that end. John Heinbockel : And then lastly on gross margin so if I look at ancillary ex-gas ancillaries that maybe six or seven basis points so was that anyone department to rise that and sort of how is pharmacy doing within that. And then the major categories within their own sales, so that was improved about five basis points versus last quarter. Is there anything to that or that was fairly broad based? Richard Galanti : I think it's more broad based than anything. I think pharmacy is fine. That was sustaining all the challenges with that industry has and we have continued to [indiscernible] putting all there. Now I don\u2019t see if there is anything specific I think it gets more back to the call a quarter ago where we said things are okay and it's not like we have it's changed a lot but these are going to fluctuate some basis points up and down periodically. John Heinbockel : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman. Simeon Gutman : Hey Richard and thanks for the color on the bigger more K TVs. My serious question is first to get the lien gross profit dynamics for Q4. Can you just give us a sense relative compare. And then I'm going to have one follow-up? Richard Galanti : Right, as everyone knows when oil prices go up we make a little less, our margins come down we make a less and when they go down we make a little more year-over-year Q3 that's where the period gas prices generally were going down that was good. But I think the direction when asked on the second quarter call which Q2 haven't been a great comparison with the other way. We didn\u2019t think it was going to be this good but we would also did know the cash prices have been key down they have gone up lately, so we will see as we had very good profits last year in Q4 some of that has to do there is a trends down towards the end of summer prices in general ex what is going into the market but it's that's why we show every corner and because there is going to be fluctuations that are dictated by what oil prices are doing. Simeon Gutman : Got it, okay. And then my follow-up is on the credit card. Can you share with us were about I guess it's almost the year away from cycling the initial I guess the initial change over can you share with us - I know there is a few buckets of margin that we are helping some of its new sign-ups some it's the spend outside of Costco. Can you give us a sense and we lap the initial been effort from last year, what accretes - what the additive and year-over-year versus what it goes away I'm guessing that the bounty's on the new sign-ups will probably fade, but can you just share with us how we should think about it? Richard Galanti : Well, I mean generically the biggest bang is in the first year is there a little extra - on the one hand there is little extra because things maybe there were some transition challenges right around there for few weeks okay that's good news going forward for little bit longer. But there was also more incentive and a bigger bank for your bucks and the first time you offer it you get more sign-ups in the first week and the second week than the third week as no more sign-ups being more bounty. So generally speaking, we still think it will be a net accretive if you will or additives to the company in the second year but the big bang is in the first year. Simeon Gutman : Okay, thanks. Richard Galanti : And if you look at Q4, Q4 there is five or six weeks of the big bang if you will before June 20th and 10 or 11 weeks afterwards so and there is a little bit above the two-thirds of its after that anniversary. Simeon Gutman : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser. Michael Lasser : My first question is on e-commerce growth which was in the low double-digits in the quarter. Richard are you mindful of maintaining your relevant online especially at a time when other traditional retailers are aggressively growing their e-com presence yet one of your big box competitors talk about 69% e-com growth in the most recent quarter and I believe you are 11% came on an easier comparison it sounds like it flowed throughout the period, so are you mindful of that at all? Richard Galanti : I guess I'll use my phrase that I used several times on the last call, not to be arrogant or cavalier about it but we feel good about what we are doing, we have got great brick-and-mortar comps, we are doing things offensively in our view, not defensively on mind and we have got a lot of things going on the online side but we are not really worried about what others are doing and there is lot of good things about online and there is challenges and we are trying to do more of the good things but again we will look into the way we do it, don't expect us to increase by 69% partly through acquisition and we are going to keep doing organically, we think we have got, we made a lot of changes in the last year probably more than we had in the last several years online, and that will show some good results. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is on the group core gross margin being up 20 basis points, that's on the heels of you making some investment in everyday low price in the prior quarter, so did you get the intended effect of those price investments, and is there now an opportunity to do more especially as your gross margin continues to float up? Richard Galanti : Well I think the 12 year is 12 on the core, I have already turned that sheet to the side, but look we are going to always do more investing in price, just when you think it's safe to go outside you guys we are going to drive sales top-line and certainly the fact that our margins are strong that we have got upcoming fee increases just starting that we have got additional monies from the credit card, all of those things allow us to do things in an offensive way and drive our business and so we kind of think we can do both, have decent margins and drive our business and lower prices. Michael Lasser : I just follow-up on that, because you mentioned the upcoming fee increase in your response to the answering about price investments, should we expect that a good portion more than half would be - that if you get enough fee increase you are going back on the price? Richard Galanti : Well I can\u2019t really tell you that, but we are known for giving a lots of things back to the consumer, to remember and it's not completely formulated but we are going to constantly try to excite our members and drive our competitors crazy. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much and good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon Richard. A couple of questions here, first curious that penetration on the new Visa card as you use the tender here in the third quarter and relative to the first half of the year and also curious to where it was relative to when you had the agreement with AmEx? Richard Galanti : Well I think we are talking in U.S. dollars because it's a U.S. program, I believe we are in 46 range currently and that's trended up since its inception a year ago, I think the highest we were on AmEx that was with AmEx co-brand, it was -- by the way but that number I'm giving you is all Visa not just Citi Visa because we accept all Visa's and we excepted all AmEx cards, not just the Costco co-brand one, I believe we have got up to the 43, 44 range, and so we have exceeded that but we wouldn't expect it to given the improved value proposition to the member, and the fact that there is just more market share out there and more places probably rewards garden to be used and again more incentive for that part to be used everywhere which helps us as well. Unidentified Analyst : And has the basket changed at all? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t know, and I know there was some anecdotal items in the very beginning at the transition on big ticket items like hearing aids or big screen TVs or furniture but I think the answer is yes it has a probably has a plus sign in front of it is so the minus but not huge and again as more anecdotal stories I have heard I didn\u2019t heard anything big. The biggest thing in terms of the whole part is the fact the inside and outside spend, we are very successful under our own program over 14 or 16 years getting the outside spend on that card up to, to get to 2.5 plus for every dollar spend inside. And that where this issuers all of the issuers wherever the co-brand card is they want more spend on that card because that creates APR that creates carry balances and late fees and everything else, and it's just a big in portfolio. And as we would expect, given the greater market share presence that a Visa has in the market there is going to be more usage if we can get that member to have that as top of wallet there is going to be more usage on it and that's exactly what is happened. Anything that get the expectations have been little better than planning on that. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, and just switching gears a little bit Michael's question on e-commerce I think you said 11% growth. Can you just remind us where the penetration is today and also the numbers SKUs that you guys are offering online so we realize you don\u2019t want to have the 350 million that Amazon has, but how big do you think you can grow that and then also on the margin profile the e-commerce business have you believe it's better than your brick-and-mortar margins just wondering if you could clarify that directionally? Richard Galanti : Yes, well the sales are about little under 3.5% of sales again is the year that we are going to end up doing just extrapolating the first three quarters something in the mid-120s we had an extra weekend there to this year. And so again it's over a well over 4 billion now. And that's we don\u2019t that's pure e-commerce online we do have delivery online, and we don\u2019t include that we have travel online we don\u2019t include that it's just been normal online that we started with. And I'm sorry, in terms of profitability nothing has really changed their generally speaking the gross margin of dot-com compared to the gross margin of warehouse as gas the four walls of the warehouse, the warehouse is a little higher. The SG&A on dot-com is a lot lower, so the pre-tax earnings of dot-com it is higher and nothing has really changed there. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, and just number of SKUs and if you have at the percentage overlap of those SKUs relative to what is in store? Richard Galanti : As we had somebody had I think there the SKU challenge ex-office supplies because that's not through a third party and there is 8,000 or 10,000 [Indiscernible] I believe, but I think we have got about 8,000 to 10,000 items and that's exclusive of like - about 2,000 of the roughly 4,000 in the warehouse are online. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, perfect. Thanks very much. Richard Galanti : And I need to say fresh foods is not online other than through third-parties like Google or like Instacart or like that in Google. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short. Karen Short : Hi thanks for taking my question. I just actually trying to get a sense on the gross margin in terms of the MVM. How much was a change in the MVM from Q2 to 3Q or how much of this does year-over-year change in margin-at-margin in 2Q versus 3Q would have been a function of the end game changes and then just wondering what is the number of days on the MVM we can expect in 4Q 2017 versus 4Q 2016? And then I just got another follow-up? Richard Galanti : Okay. Well, first of all in terms of the number of days, I think it's like four or less this coming year versus a year ago. Three or four? It's a few days, so not totally meaningful, I mean the big meaningful was in Q2 when it was 17 less on 84 days. And I'm sorry the other question, Karen, the first one you had asked. Karen Short : Well when we just look at how the merchandize margin in 2Q versus merchandize margin change in 3Q, I guess how much of the difference I mean sequentially was due to the MVM changes, like the pressure that you had in 2Q versus what we are looking out on 3Q? Richard Galanti : I think the biggest change from Q2 year-on-year and Q3 year-on-year was the number of MVM days. we are still being pretty aggressive on the MVM being fewer items with better savings and it's plus a little more if you will that have a seat at the table there from a vendor merchandizing standpoint. But we are also [indiscernible] if we need to - we are not here just to drive margins down, we have got lot of buckets of stuff and when you have increasing kind of inflation and some higher margins areas like fresh foods or some high margins area like pharmacy, those things help as well. But there is something in little pieces that can effect it. Overall we felt pretty good about the Q3 comparison versus the Q2. But there is no material change. Karen Short : Okay. And then I guess just as obviously we are kind of getting out of a deflationary period and into flat or maybe slightly inflationary there has just been a lot of questioning as to how deflation impacted your P&L versus how inflation will impact your P&L and I guess I just want to talk through that a little because it would seems to me that deflation, because you had some much tonnage, it actually is a double set, because you have so much more labor involved in meeting the demand. So I don't know if there is any way you try to talk through a little bit on how much more easing I guess you'd have on the P&L as we are no longer in a deflationary period [indiscernible]. Richard Galanti : Well I think for low margin retailers and certainly we are at the low end and the lowest end of margins, but super market is well on the food side, a little inflation is good, a little deflation hurts you a little bit it still has the D in front of it, not the IN and so it\u2019s still impacting some. it hurts you most in items like I think the example I gave last quarter was of fresh meats where year-over-year, second quarter or first quarter year-over-year per pound beef was down by 10% and we were selling more than 10% more tonnage and certainly we are having lower gross margin dollars because of that and so as that changes that will help us a little bit. Karen Short : Well I guess presumably higher growth SG&A dollars to you because of the labor content, that's kind of where I'm getting at it, there seems like you didn\u2019t have a lot\u2026 Richard Galanti : Actually on the fresh foods we have higher labor, inflation would help all those things. Karen Short : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem. Zachary Fadem : Hi good evening. So, Kirkland Signature continues to perform pretty well, just to what extent is this growth coming at the expense of branded items if any and when you think about positioning the brand going forward are there any areas where you think Kirkland is underpenetrated and work pursuing expansion? Richard Galanti : Well, I'm sure of it in term of the expensive branded some of that though in some cases it's the branded manufacturers they are supplying as not always by no means not all the time and but it's another competitor and again we are pretty transparent about it we want brands and private label and so we will continue to see both of those. it really is an item business and some of the success on the - all of the big items I mean paper trails, water, giant items that are 100s of millions as dollar - we have a several items that are billion dollars in unit sales several KS items.  In some cases we have a billion plus dollars on the branded side of the same time, whether it's assortment or bounty and Kirkland Signature one those two items whether it's various regional brand names of order of its Kirkland Signature order. And it works for us and we will continue to do that. Our new category, while I think in the last in the last year or two I think the thing that has done very well for us is the wine and spirits and that continues to have some legs and substantial legs and the good news like other KS items when the brands loose the market share they get sharper on their own prices which with us not only with everybody hopefully which makes it a season more competitive more on the brands. So all of that stuff works in our view will sure benefit and having the brand loyalty certainly helps with membership and wanting them to come back to Costco. Other areas our voice apparel still has legs if you will and arms I guess. You have got cosmetics organic items and there has been several organic items probably every month of the budget meeting we see new organic items whether its chicken broth or beef broth or some candy caramel chocolate things or nuts clusters and these are $10 million to $25 million whole margin items for us without competitor. In terms of it's not replacing a branded item necessarily. We have done really well in some of the other snack items and energy bar items. We have items where - if a bar I don\u2019t need names here, but if a retail bar, retails for $2 meaning we would sell it for $1.49 we are out there sell the buck on a great item and a full margin for us and providing to some real volume and so I think apparel, cosmetics, health and beauty aids, organic food items not fresh, but packaged food items all those are areas where we continue to I think have some room to grow. Zachary Fadem : Okay, thanks for the color. So Richard could you - I know and nothing to beat on e-commerce so again but could you provide some early color on the Instacart and ship partnerships and is there anything notable you could call out regarding customers response or basket sizes versus an in store shop and then just going forward how should we think about potential expansion of these partnerships? Richard Galanti : Well it's still a very small piece of our business, but it seems to be working in a sense, since that it's growing for them. We have Google Express which is operates on a five cities with several markets but they are in the process out there of offering as several items in one to three day delivery and we are participating in that with them, so that should be a positive for the program. Instacart has continued to grow dramatically, they currently operate in 40 of our cities up from 26 a year ago utilizing 240 of our warehouses from a 132 a year ago so that's growing, and then there is a few others that I mentioned [indiscernible] was one or something else. Boxed, I don't know if we are doing that, that\u2019s [indiscernible] and look two big ones are Google Instacart and there is not a whole lot of other color, they are working; we want sell merchandizing and they help us do that, but again don't expect us to be doing anything giant and big in one [indiscernible]. Zachary Fadem : Got it. Thanks Richard. I appreciate the Time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot Richard, good afternoon. First question is a follow-up on inflation, we are seeing overall CPI start to recover, but we have seen the producer price index for PPI come back a little bit faster, are you concerned at all about any kind of gross margin squeeze s or is what you are seeing on the cost front resembling some of those macro indicators or should we just think about the fact that pricing is moving higher and general is being in that positive [indiscernible]. Richard Galanti : Pricing move general is net positive, if anything though I think we create some of our own deflationary pressures because we are good at - look at the MVM example, greater value to the member means greater lower prices which means us and our vendor lowering the price some and most of that is driving prices down from our suppliers with the anticipation of significantly more unit volume. The good is, most of time that happens and so that's what we do, but that does drive - those things work, don't always work in concert with the immediate bottom line improvement. Matthew Fassler : Understood and then second question, just relates to competition. As Amazon takes 10s and billions of dollars of retail share annually and clearly the biggest share gain or by far the biggest one we have seen in a while. Are you seeing any - obviously your comps overall are increasing at a faster rate than most of the states, is there anything you are seeing in the mix that we might not catch through some of the commentary, that would suggest a change in complexion of how the consumer is really using your store, is it more consumable focused than it had been or is it kind of business as usual with no sign of change in the backdrop? Richard Galanti : Look so far, and there is no guarantee in the future, but so far it's been business as usual. There is a number I read few months ago about how Amazon - if the entire U.S. sale, increase in sales or whatever, it was 50 billion they were half of it, well they were, 25 divided by 50 is half, but we were also up, the fact is there is others in the industry that were down 50 billion and so they were a quarter of a 100, minus 50 to plus 50.  That 25 billion is still credible and formidable, but in our view we are fortunate that a lot of the impact is it's impacting some food items or even packaged food items, it's traditional food retail that is getting hit more than us. We have to keep driving our member into our warehouse and we do that with off course great prices and great items certainly fresh foods, certainly gas station and traffic, which brings them into parking lot if you will and certainly the loyalty program which they have on to, all those have been helped us and then the treasure hunt. We love it when we hear from someone that they heard that we had something, they went the next day and it wasn\u2019t there. well we are still pretty good at all that stuff and I think again the Kirkland Signature help that as well. now so far so good. When we look at the specifics even in markets where whether those Amazon or somebody else is taking share, a lot of were there taking on fracture something, fracture is hard and even they would acknowledge and others. There will be more competition in the future, but who is going to get - we are asked a lot about legal coming into the east coast, they are going to take share, but they are going to take share from everybody else a lot more than they can take share from us. So we haven\u2019t really seen a big change like people are buying less something at Costco because of other formats out there. Matthew Fassler : Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell. Paul Trussell : Hey Richard. On SG&A we have recently cycled some labor investments made a year-ago. Could you just outline for us some other puts and takes we should keep in mind that\u2019s is going to impact the P&L in 4Q and beyond? Richard Galanti : I'm sorry could you repeat that. Paul Trussell : So on SG&A on the expense front, really just want you to help us think about some puts and takes on the expense side of things in 4Q and beyond especially since we just cycled some of the labor investments you made a year-ago? Richard Galanti : Right, well look the biggest put and take is sales. If we can get another percentage point or two in sales that's always good and that solves a lot of things. When you look at some of the line items payroll is the next one, yes we just anniversaried some of that at the end of March that helps a little bit. Healthcare is still a challenge in the U.S. increasing penetration outside of the U.S. helps that number just by a higher a penetration within the total cost of the company and lot less everywhere else. But again that's going to happen slowly overtime in a positive way, and in some quarters the inflation the U.S. is does more than any small offset to that.  IT expenditures, somebody internally said we probably get the question asked upon it is the zero year-over-year basis point or inflection point, probably not we got to be lucky. Sales were a little higher, we had lot of expenses last year leading up to the end of the fiscal year or day one of the new fiscal year when we installed the new [indiscernible] counting platform on which other things will be built and so we had a lot of third-party contracts, lot of training which you write off, you don\u2019t capitalize and so that will get a little help there. But in fact, it will come down overtime but it's not going to be zero. I think we e-commerce helps a little bit to the extent even at 11% last quarter or 13% or 14% in the first two-thirds of the quarter before the Mothers Day and what have you that's a higher growth rate than the rest of the company. So that a much lower SG&A, so that helps you a little bit. But I think we do pretty well at trying to drive the things in a right direction, but not touching certain things, we are not going to tweak wages a little bit less or does have an increase that\u2019s a little bit less. We don't do big things like some of those incremental things that anniversary at March like done on scale. We ended that I think in six years, but every three years we look at everything formal way. And so we are still couple of years away from looking again in terms of the big way. I still vote for a sales increase, if you get some extra sales everything else falls in place. Paul Trussell : And then just could you speak to Gold Star and overall household membership growth; the growth has slowed a little bit. Just how you are thinking about membership count in the U.S. and also what you are seeing on the international front? Richard Galanti : Part of it has to do where we are spending, several of our units in the past couple of years in the U.S. for example that it's do small markets, where you don't give the biggest bang. I think we had one big bang, I gave you example of Tulsa in new market, but that's not as small as some of the markets we want to do. When we open in another Seattle unit which we have two in last couple of -- two and a half years, or in the Greater LA market, it's a great success net of cannibalization. But you don't get a few 1,000 extra members, because everybody is member couple of more frequently because 20 minutes for driving the roadmap 40. We also -- part of the growth depends on how many units we are opening overseas. When we open a new unit in Asia, as of opening date signups paid signups over the eight or 10 or 12 weeks prior and through opening day, you could have 25,000 to 40,000 new members. Iceland although there is only one location in Iceland, as of opening day we had I think over 35,000 members, over 35,000 and it's national news. And so I don't worry looking into the numbers, it's much based on where we have opened, it's not like a life opening compared to two years ago is getting fewer signups. Operator : And your next question comes from Scott Mushkin. Scott Mushkin : I just want to follow-up on the last question, just a dated question jumped into my head. Are comp memberships actually rising in U.S.? Richard Galanti : Comp memberships\u2026you mean comp buildings? Scott Mushkin : The memberships going up and\u2026. Richard Galanti : I think they are but it's probably a very small number, I mean closer to zero than the number of others. And part of that is when you are opening in a, let's say when we opened in Redmond where Microsoft's headquartered, that cannibalized knowingly three locations, two of them doing in the low to mid 300s a year, and doing in the mid 200s or low 200s a year. We signed up several 1,000 new members, but not 20,000 new members. If we average roughly 62 -- if we are just adding to our membership number of households divided by number of locations, it's about 61,000 or 62,000. And next year of that opening the comp of those three locations is down because some of those members now are allocated to the new rounds. Scott Mushkin : So the one I want to just ask about just popping in my head. So how do you think about that as your business matures in the U.S., I mean does that make you want to slow down your center growth I mean how should we frame that, it's maybe the number eventually goes negative? Richard Galanti : Maybe it does, I don't think we are there yet. For 25 years people have asked what is your next, whatever -- what is your next fresh foods, what is your next gas station, what is your next pharmacy, what is your next geographic market. Five years ago, I don\u2019t think any of us thought about and I am not assuming us about going into New Orleans, in Baton Rouge, in Mobile and Rochester and Toledo and Tulsa and the like. And we know by the way on average that you are going to be a little slower to take few extra years, but they still have good metrics to them. We have slowed I think using the two examples in Greater Seattle area in last 2.5 to 3 years we have opened Woodville and Redmond we waited on Redmond for 10 years to do knowing that we actually owned land in Redmond 15-20 years ago. But as we opened [indiscernible] there can be in the first one of these sides of CNE and then several years later opened Woodville, which is north of that north of Redmond, we have kept -- we actually sold the land and years ago. And finally -- so we are we try to be pragmatic about what we do. But overtime you are right we haven\u2019t found the bottom, that's the good news. In terms of, again anecdotally, I remember years ago when we have included we needed a minimum of 0.5 million population to serve the warehouse. And then it was 450, now it is 400 and we have the very successful warehouses that you divide the number of households in the community in the population, it's in the very low 200s and if you were in the high 100s. So hopefully we will keep pacing that goal in that direction and that will give us little more life hopefully the business center create some life, and hopefully that term fee is to improve. And hopefully we find couple of more countries. So we think we have got plenty to go and so that changes we'll let you know. Scott Mushkin : So then my follow-up question and my real question was I noticed BJs competitor of you has offerings and pretty significant discounts on their memberships. I think you get the first three months free if I am remembering the commercial correctly and $40 for the first year. How do you -- is that matter to you guys I mean you are putting a fee increase through. But a competitor in the northeast and Mid-Atlantic southeast is offering significant discounts. I just wanted to get your comments on that and then all yield? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Sure. And I think first if the advertise is good, we don\u2019t advertise we don\u2019t spend on that and we would love seeing add TV and the print adds still from both other competitors. And we are not concerned about it. We think that the value of the Costco is still as significantly higher price or without the free three months is a much better value. And we think that's evidence by our success of what we have done overtime and the fact that even what we have done in the past renewal rates have not really been impacted by it. Operator : And your next question is from Brian Nagel. Brian Nagel : On the gross margin Richard it was definitely a better performance here than the prior quarter, s going back to the discussion we had on the conference call last quarter. How much of the better performance reflected I guess more stable gas price environment, was that a significant contributing factor to the gross margins this quarter? Richard Galanti : Well, the guest helps the margins as did other ancillary business as well. But again to put me in terms the chase, the roughly 80% of our sales which is food, sundries, fresh -- food, sundries, hardlines, soft lines and fresh foods, year-over-year on their own sales they were up 12 basis points. So, it was a lot of different things. Operator : And your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli. Scot Ciccarelli : Two questions, number one, in terms of the e-commerce business as you guys reach a certain scale. Do you need to change your processes or do you continue to go with the drop ship philosophy? Richard Galanti : What relates to what, I didn't hear the first question? Scot Ciccarelli : Your e-commerce\u2026 Richard Galanti : Well, as I mentioned earlier, part of the inventory increase in the Company because we are just rejuvenated by number of warehouses, you give me a number and we'll maybe change that over time. But we had an increase in inventory for e-commerce related stuff, not at the warehouses but we went from seven to 19 distribution points in the last year. So we are getting closer to the customer, we are also working with third parties. I mentioned in the call the GE scheduling system there is other scheduling thing that we are doing. And I mentioned the thing we are testing right now in our Bedford Illinois Business Center. I mentioned last quarter where in addition to 50 or 70 mile radius where we deliver with Costco truck through third party, there is one or three day delivery to 17 states all the way to the Pennsylvania New Jersey. And so if anything I think we are getting it's getting quicker and cheaper to do these things for us. And maybe we started off high and begin with how we baked and how we did it, but we are improving. Scot Ciccarelli : And then second question is hopefully this is an easy calculation here. We look at the debt redemption the issuance, looks like you guys would be incurring about 25 million more a year in interest cost call it 6 million a quarter. Should that just be a pretty straight calculation or is there something else we should keep in mind as we kind of work on our model? Richard Galanti : I did a back of the envelop this morning and I came in with a number that's few million higher that still has two in front of it. Now it's pretty straightforward I mean you've got 3.8 billion tons somewhere between 260 and 270, call it 265 it\u2019s a rounded number, you've to pay down of the March debt that we did, which was 60 million a year savings, you've got the call, shortly of the 1.1 billion, 108% that's on the interest expense line, a little bit of an offset will be the cash. As you know we borrowed 38, roughly 31 is the dividend, the others 700 is cash earning less than net interest rate, and even less than the one that\u2019s coming up. But it all moves up to something like you said, if you go back to the March where we had in place the March 2017 5.5%. Operator : Your next question is from Oliver Chen. Oliver Chen : Our question is on multi vendor mailer, how are you feeling about what you've been doing in terms of testing and learning; and that the MVM product versus the product that you are offering at every day values? It's been -- I know you are thinking about how to optimize that appropriately; so just curious about the status of that? And the second question is about the mobile app, and Amazon has a really good mobile app. So what features do you want to have in your mobile app over time that you don't have now? Thank you. Richard Galanti : I want to get back to you on the latter question. Just because I don't have something here you can help me on that one. The first one, I forgot now, what was it? Oliver Chen : The monthly vendor mailer\u2026. Richard Galanti : I think we feel good about it. I think as I have said on the last call, something as we enhanced the value and kept in the multi vendor mailer and items some of the things we took out and did everyday little pricing on; sometimes it's still better value based on and the vendor working towards that end and to have it more prominent, so there is lots of different things. It was 12 weeks ago that I said to you and many of you on the phone things are fine, there is a few things that impacted us a little more or something that didn\u2019t work. I think we have improved on all of those things but we will continue to do that it's been only as we haven\u2019t solve family answered everything but we feel good about what is happened in the last 12 weeks as it relate to that question. Oliver Chen : Richard, lastly on traffic and store traffic you've been able to do a great job on the multiyear basis with physical store traffic. What are some of the opportunities ahead or what are some of the plans you have just aim to sustain that in a sustainable healthily growing manner? And how do we or should we be more cautious because it's been still good on a multiyear basis. Just it's something we monitor and it's been impressive for you to achieve such good store traffic in a tough environment. Richard Galanti : Well, this is where we go all shocks. And I think we are going to keep focusing on driving value of items and identify the item that makes sense. And I mean it as many of you known us for years as we have said many times, it's the good news it's a lot of little things. Even gasoline is a lot of little things today, because it had a big help for several years in the U.S. -- in Canada for few years. We now have about a dozen plus unit at the gas stations and countries like Japan and Australia, and soon a couple of other countries. And not everywhere, but it's now a lot of its little extra thing in some of those countries. I think the wine and spirit thing has caught us off guard in a positive way that what started as a few line items a number of years ago we are actually receiving rewards on price points that are nobody can match and the trust to the brand. On the spirit side, we never thought we would be successful, and it's a double positive because it's not only selling us the full margin private label item but it's creditors the brands don\u2019t like losing market share to us and they want to get look better on pricing at Costco, so all those things had helped us. I think the apparel area as I have mentioned has been something we hadn\u2019t thought about it. But over the last two or three years, it's a $5 plus billion business that's been growing at 9% compound it's 3.5 years. And that has more lives even though retail apparel was weak. And so we will keep coming up with stuff. I think the first trend that our traffic went from a boring 4.2 compound for seven calendar years '09 through '15 and then it hit 38, 35, 33, 28 and everybody is saying Bob and I others were the first to say, this could very well be the durable not just punch on it but 4.2 is pretty hard to do. With that being said we feel really -- where we got some things for traffic drivers and fresh food still has legs, JS still has legs, gasoline still has legs executive membership so the credit card extra value. So we feel pretty good about -- that's in a way or not quantitative answer but all things are relatively sorted. Oliver Chen : Richard, you have very talented merchant. Did Amazon is trying to hire them is that something that comes up in terms of that capability being such a competitive advantage? Richard Galanti : I would hope not. To my knowledge, we lost one or two merchants but not in the last few years. We lose a few IT engineers several of whom 18 months of the date call us back after they hit their [indiscernible]. But that's everywhere I mean look Amazon is in our town and they hire a lot of people from every company in town and out of town. We have been fortunate, people have chosen to stick around but the answer is no, we haven't. But we cross our fingers to you in the future. Operator : And the next question is from Kelly Bania. Kelly Bania : Just another one with e-commerce, I think you mentioned that you've expanded some KS items online. Just wondering if you could elaborate what categories those are. And really just what is the pricing strategy with online versus in-store for those items that I think you said 2,000 items that crossover. I mean should we expect prices are the same or is there a difference in pricing strategy online versus in the club? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Sometimes online they don't hire for delivery, sometimes as we tried some, what call them velocity apparel items, stocks and shirts and things. We need to some of that ourselves in terms of shipping as we want to get people comfortable ordering velocity items, whether its apparel or health and beauty aids or sundries like Jacobs. And unfortunately, I don't have the list in front of me and some of the new items with several KS items, but other brands as well. And again give me a call after the holiday -- I just don't have that information with me. Kelly Bania : And then can I just ask one more just clarification on gross margin. I think when you talked about the core gross margin the up 7 up 20 with and without gas that includes the 16 basis points from the Citi Visa but the up 12 the 80 basis or the 80% of the core business, up 12, that excludes the Citi Visa. Is that correct? Richard Galanti : That\u2019s correct, yes. Operator : And your next question is from Peter Benedict. Peter Benedict : Richard, just a couple of quick ones, MFI trends, some underlying slowing there I mean is that just a friction from the new card changeovers or are you seeing anything in terms of signups that's concerning you? Richard Galanti : The biggest issue is re-openings in the quarter, actually two net openings. One was there so no, nothing that's terribly -- that's concerning. Nothing that is dis-concerning, I shouldn't have used the word terribly. Peter Benedict : Second question, the lift in comp that you've seen over the last several months recovering comp trends; has there been anything in terms of business members versus Gold Star, anything like that that has kind of disproportionately driven that? Richard Galanti : No, not really. Peter Benedict : And then my last question is just around the e-commerce fulfillment centers, just get 19 of those. Where do you see that number going in the next few years? And then could the clubs actually be used for that whether you said 2,000 items that are in the clubs that are also offered online, can the clubs to be used to sell that delivery of those? Richard Galanti : First of all, going from 7 to 19 has a lot. And again, we are more than saving on that because we are getting the stuff to you quicker. We are spending less on freight we did it somewhat inefficiently to start with. There\u2019ll be more -- I don\u2019t that's I don\u2019t know if -- I just know what those few data points for 7 and 19. The other question was where we ever use the warehouses fulfillment centers, yes sure. And I'm saying that not suggesting it's going to happen tomorrow. And one of the things we are doing with the Bedford, Illinois Business Center in a way is e-commerce related, you order online and it will be deliver in one to three days via third party carrier; certain items, I mean I think the items have certain weight and size limitations we are not to be delivering sofas to New Jersey from there. But probably we will be delivering that but using the business centers like using a warehouse and different set of items, but it was easy to do because it will set up at some ways to accommodate it fat. And we\u2019ll see, but it's logical to think that would you have some of allocations around the country that could do some things at night when they closed or a low volume unit that could help out. But we haven\u2019t -- don\u2019t expect anything on that front for at least the next year, and I would always suggesting to next year that this we haven\u2019t really talked about and a lot of other than could we. Operator : And your next question is from Greg Melich. Greg Melich : Richard, could you fill us in on what gas was the percentage of sales. And I think you said the gallons comp positive and if you have the number that would be great. And I have follow-up? Richard Galanti : It was okay we are almost there. Greg Melich : Should I go with the next question? Richard Galanti : Yes. Greg Melich : Okay, so the other question I just want to make sure I get the timing of Visa fitting and how that came in last year. So it is the 36 bps of help to the EBIT margin, if I get this right. And in the fourth quarter, we should probably get another four or five weeks of that benefit. Am I thinking about that right or is there some other thing at work, if I remember correctly, as you are running out the Amex program you were not signing up people and not getting the payments for signing up people for the card? Or is it just the straight forward think about that got a few more weeks of the benefit cycles? Richard Galanti : I think it's like six weeks, not just three or four but then you get -- there was 220 that we have some disruption around it. We are also conservative on some of the assumptions. I mean look it\u2019s not going to be nearly as it was in the last three quarters, but it's not going to be a quarter is the only of quarters base. In terms of the gallon comps, it's a very strong number. It has two digits but not -- is very low two digits, so I can't tell you anything. Greg Melich : Low single digits, and gas a percentage of total company sales? Richard Galanti : Yes, hold on a second\u2026 Greg Melich : And maybe why you are digging that out, since I got -- the membership fee growth in local currencies, how much effect that line? Richard Galanti : First of all gas is a little under 10% and the other one was membership fees, that was in my -- membership fees reported was up 4% in dollars, or $26 million and 5% without FX. FX was a $3.6 million hit to the number. FX should have been flatter -- the number would have been $3.6 million higher. Operator : And your next question is from Edward Kelly. Edward Kelly : Richard, just a couple of quick one for you entail on here, on the gross margin in Q4. Is there any extra leverage from the extra week in Q4 that we should expect, that's meaningful at all? Richard Galanti : Nothing. The margin very little on the expense side almost nothing. Edward Kelly : And then on just a follow-up on fresh food, just provide maybe more color on what is tied up here in terms of things you've been talking about, particularly in organics. And is there any kind of step change or just continuation of what you've been doing? Richard Galanti : Global store sales -- being the largest purveyor of USDA prime beef in the universe and we are now -- in the U.S. we are something like a third of all U.S. prime beef sales. Before \u201908, vast majority of all prime beef sales went to restaurants and hotels. Edward Kelly : And how are you doing on capacity and some items in produce from an organic standpoint that maybe you struck a little bit in the past? Richard Galanti : I think, overall, and not just us but everybody has benefitted in fact there is more supply out there. I think we feel competitively from a standpoint that we are well positioned because I think we have used the number on produce. We source produce from 44 countries, nobody does that and that gives us some additional advantage in that area. But it's gotten less hard but it's still organic as -- there is more demand than there is supply. But if I look at the price points of organic versus conventional, on most items, the premium is still a premium but not as big a premium that it was two years ago because of the fact that there is less of a supply demand imbalance. Operator : And there're no further questions. Richard Galanti : Well, thank you everyone. Have a good afternoon, and holiday. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Christie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 Earnings Call and September sales. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to CFO, Richard Galanti. You may begin sir. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Christie and good afternoon to everyone. I\u2019ll start by saying that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported our fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2017 operating results for the 17-week and 53-week periods ended September 3 and our September sales results for the five week retail month ended this past Sunday, October 1. For the 17-week fiscal fourth quarter, reported earnings came in at $2.08 a share, up $0.31 over last year's fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.77. In comparing our year-over-year fourth quarter operating results, several items to note. First, of course this year\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter was comprised of 17 weeks of operations. Last year\u2019s fourth quarter results covered 16 weeks. We just finished the year which had the extra weekend. Second, the improved results related to co-branded credit card, as we reported in each of our first three quarters of fiscal \u201917, as the Citi Visa co-branded credit card program again positively impacted our year-over-year gross margins by 14 basis points and SG&A expenses by 8 basis points and our overall bottom line in Q4, benefiting earnings year-over-year by an aggregate of 22 basis points or $0.13 a share over the 17-week fourth quarter. More detail to follow later in the call on this. Gas profitability, the third item. Our profits from gas during the quarter as compared to last year's fourth quarter were higher by about 40 million pretax or $0.05 a share. Number four, gross margin, this year's fourth quarter margin, the gross margin included $20 million of pretax benefits from non-recurring legal items, which were partially offset by about a $10 million reserve charge for inventory losses attributable to Hurricane Harvey. Together, this net $10 million pretax benefit represented a benefit of 2 basis point improvement to gross margin or about a penny and a half share benefit to earnings per share. Fifth item of note, SG&A. This year's fourth quarter SG&A expenses included an $11 million or about a penny and a half negative hit related to Hurricane Harvey. This represented about a 3 basis point detriment to our reported SG&A percentage in the quarter. Number six, modernization related IT, as a percent of sales, only slightly higher by a basis point year-over-year. Next, FX. There's two FX items to point out. On an operating basis compared to a year ago, foreign currencies had a very slight negative impact to earnings, less than $1 million pretax. Also, in our interest income and other line, the year-over-year swing in gains and losses related to accounting for our FX exposures in the other countries where we operate. In Q4, the year-over-year swing was about a minus $12 million pretax or $0.02 a share hit, impact to EPS year-over-year. Last year, in Q4, we had a gain of 11 million in terms of these items. This year, we had a loss of about $1 million recorded in this year in the fourth quarter. Number eight, income taxes. We had favorable discrete tax items in both fourth quarters, both this year and last. In last year's fourth quarter, discrete tax items benefited the last year's fourth quarter earnings by $0.05 a share. This year's fourth quarter discrete positive tax items benefited earnings per share by $0.03, so $0.02 lesser benefit this year over last year. And lastly, LIFO, there was no LIFO charge or credit in this year's fourth quarter results whereas last year's fourth quarter results had a LIFO credit of $31 million, reflecting deflation in our LIFO indices a year ago or a $0.04 per share benefit last year versus zero this year. Turning to fourth quarter sales, reported sales were up 16% in the quarter, including the benefit from the extra week and reported comparable sales figure, which compares a like-for-like number of weeks year-over-year was up 6.1%. For the quarter, the plus 6.1% comp sales figure was helped by gasoline price inflation to the tune of about a half a percentage point and hurt slightly by a slight detriment from the FX impact. In terms of new openings, in Q4, we opened 12 new locations, six in the US, two in Canada and one each in Australia, Japan, Iceland and France, the last two countries being new countries for us as well. As of our fiscal year end, we operated 741 locations worldwide, including 26 new buildings during the year. We opened 28, but two of them are relos. This afternoon, I\u2019ll also review with you membership trends and renewal rates and update on our co-branded Citi Visa card. I'll discuss a little bit further about margins and expenses, I\u2019ll discuss e-commerce results and some recent initiatives, a couple of other new initiatives as well and lastly, I'll give you a recap of our September sales results for the five week period ended this past Sunday. So on to the results. Sales for this year's fourth quarter, the 17 weeks ended September 3 were $41.36 billion, up 16% over last year's 35.73 billion. On a reported comp basis, Q4 comp sales were up 6.1% for the quarter on a reported basis, up 5.7% after accounting for fluctuations and gas prices and FX. For the quarter, our reported 6.1% comp sales results were a combination of an average transaction increase of 2.1% for the quarter, an average shopping frequency increase for the company worldwide 3.9% up and within that 3.9%, it's up 4.4% for the US. In terms of sales comparisons by geography, for the fourth quarter, within the US, the Midwest, Southeast and Texas regions were the strongest, with other US regions not far behind. Internationally, in local currencies, better performing countries were Japan, Mexico and the UK. In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, within that 6% reporting comp, food and sundries up about 4%, strong categories include spirits, deli and frozen, hardlines, up in the mid-single digits. Overall, strongest department results were lawn and garden, tires, toys and consumer electronics itself were up in high singles. Softlines were up in the high singles overall with housewares, jewelry and home furnishings showing the best results and in fresh foods, comp sales were in the mid-single digits, relatively consistent across various departments of meat, bakery, deli and produce. Within ancillary, gasoline had strong comps in the quarter aided by higher average sale price this year versus last as well as very strong gallon growth. In addition, hearing aids were up in the mid-teens, followed by optical and food court. Moving to the line items of the income statement, I\u2019ll start with membership fees. Membership fees were up 13.4% or $111 million year-over-year. As a percent of sales, they were down 5 basis points, as we expect in part due to simply the strong sales results. Of the $111 million increase in fees year-over-year, about 15 million related to the membership fee increases we took, a little over half of that $15 million from the fee increases taken in our international operations last September 2016 and the balance from the June 1 increases taken in the US and Canada recently. In terms of membership, our renewal rates are fine. There's still some slight negative renewal rate impact from the US credit card conversion last year and we expect that to continue for at least a quarter or two and we continue to see increased penetration of our executive membership. In terms of number of members at Q4 end, at year end, at Q3 end, we started with Gold Star of 37.8 million and at the end of the quarter, at the end of the year, we had 38.6. Business primary was 7.4 at each period; business add-on, 3.4; total member households, 48.6 at third quarter end and 17 weeks later at fiscal year-end, 49.4 million. All told, cardholders were 88.9 million a quarter ago. And fourth quarter year end was 90.3. At year end, paid executive memberships totaled 18.5 million, an increase of 274,000 since third quarter end, which is about 16,000 per week increase in the quarter. Executive members are about 38% of our member base and about two-thirds of our sales. In terms of renewal rates, at year end, business members renewed at 94%, Gold Star members at 89.3%, these are numbers for the US and Canada combined, which is over 80% of our company and total US and Canada 90.0%, and worldwide, 87.2%, a slight tick down of a tenth or two from the last quarter. A lot of that, as I mentioned earlier, we believe relates to -- in the US, the conversion last June to the new credit card program and with auto rebuild and again, we expect that to continue to downtrend a little bit in the next quarter or two. While I'm on the subject of membership, I\u2019d like to spend a couple of minutes to respond to the many questions we get literally every day relating to concerns -- the following concerns. One, the new member sign ups might be slowing. Two, that the average number of member households per location seems to be coming down a little. And three, that with the increasing overlap of people having both a Costco membership and an Amazon Prime account and the fact that more and more people are having groceries delivered by everyone, is this the beginning of something that will impact Costco. As to new memberships sign up slowing, we believe it's virtually all related to timing, the timing of openings and the timing of two online new membership initiatives we undertook, one each in the past two fiscal years. For example, in the first three fiscal quarters of 2017, fiscal 2017, in these 36 weeks, we opened 16 new warehouses, including two openings with outsized sign ups, both in Asia, a new unit in each of Korea and Taiwan. Those were done last January. Each of these locations added almost 60,000 new members to our base. In Q4, we opened -- in these 17 weeks, we opened 12 new locations, three were large sign ups in Japan, Iceland and France. Again, these three locations, each opened for only 5 to 15 weeks in the fourth quarter added a total of 180,000 members to our base, again an average of about 60,000 new members per building. So timing of those certainly impact the numbers in terms of averages. Conversely, when we look at openings that cannibalize the existing nearby locations, you'll add maybe a few thousand at the most new members at that new location, the result will drive an expected $80 million to $100 million of new annual sales in that market, but lower the average number of members for each building in that market by 10,000 or more. The other timing issue, in the last two fiscal years, we've done two online new membership drives, each which added an average of around 200,000 members, one a little less and one a little more. The fiscal 2016 event occurred in February of \u201916, near the end of our second quarter. The fiscal 17 event occurred in August in the fourth quarter of this year. So again, timing played an issue with that. One last data point, if I take all of the US and Canada locations and I exclude all the new openings and all locations that were being cannibalized, in many cases, by these new openings, the average number of members at these remaining locations grew year-over-year from the end of fiscal \u201916 to the end of fiscal \u201917 by approximately 4% year-over-year. So our view is that we're fine and hopefully that answers some of the many questions we've got on these questions. As to the other question, as it relates to increased delivery options by everyone, is it impacting us and is it impacting our brick and mortar? A few comments. One, of course, our sales and our comps are strong and have even trended up. Two, our shopping frequency is strong and has also trended up. Three, our value proposition, we believe it's stronger than ever. Four, we're just getting started on some of the new delivery options of our own and I'll talk about that in a minute. And five, we're using online and the Internet to drive businesses both to e-commerce as well as in store. So stay tuned and we'll continue to discuss that in each quarter. Before continuing down the income statement line items, a couple of updated stats on the Citi Visa card offering. Again, this began in Q4 of last year in June, about June 20 I believe. When the conversion to Citi Visa occurred in June of 16, there were 11.4 million co-branded cards or about 7.4 million accounts being transferred over to Citi. As of Q4 end, just over a year since the conversion, we now have 1.8 million new approved member accounts or about 2.4 million new cards, including about 270,000 new accounts during the past 17 weeks. Overall, we're seeing the Citi Visa co-branded portfolio total spend higher year-over-year, both organically and from these new accounts. Despite the fact that we had a partial comparison to the conversion last year, since it was midway through Q4, it was still positive year-over-year to gross margin, SG&A and EPS as I mentioned that earlier. I should note though that we\u2019d anticipate the year-over-year comparisons to moderate of course as it did actually in Q4 as well to moderate starting with the first quarter. Lastly, we continue to enhance the value proposition, not only of being a Costco member, but then being a Costco executive member and then even better at Costco executive member using the Citi Visa Anywhere card. I'll share a couple of new examples of that during the remainder of this call. Overall, in terms of conversion, usage and sign-ups for the card, all good at this point. Going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin the fourth quarter was lower year-over-year by 15 basis points. As I do always, I\u2019ll ask you to jot down a few numbers. We\u2019ll do four columns. The first two columns are year-over-year basis point changes for the third quarter. First column would be as reported and the second column would be without gas inflation. And then Q4 reported and Q4 without gas inflation. So those would be the four columns. First line item would be core merchandising. In Q3, we reported improvement year-over-year of plus 7 basis points, without gas inflation, plus 20. This year, in Q4, minus 8 and minus 3. Ancillary in Q3 was plus 15 reported and plus 19 ex inflation in gas. In Q4, minus 1 and plus 1, 2% reward from executive membership, minus 2 and minus 4 in the third and fourth columns, plus 1 and zero. LIFO, minus 5 and minus 5 in Q3 and minus 9 and minus 9 in Q4. Other, minus 7 and minus 7 in Q3 and the two columns for Q4, plus 2 and plus 2. So all told, on a reported basis, in Q3, 17 year-over-year, we were up 8 basis points, without gas inflation, up 23. And in Q4, on a reported basis, down 15 and without gas inflation, minus 9. Now, mind you, in these numbers, the Citi Visa impact, as I mentioned earlier, in Q4, was plus 14 on a reported basis and on -- without gas inflation. So if you look at that way, the minus 15 would be minus 29 ex that and the minus 9 would be minus 23 ex that. Now, overall, as I mentioned, reported margins were 15 basis points down year-over-year and 9 ex gas and as I just mentioned, taking out the Citi Visa benefit, minus 29 and minus 23. Now, within that, the core merchandise component gross margin was lower by 8 reported, but 3 excluding gas. As I've shared before, the subcategories within our core gross margin, which is almost 80% of our sales within the warehouse, food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percent of their own sales, they were essentially flat year-over-year, notwithstanding the investing in price that we have done during the course of this, with food and sundries and softlines being up a little bit year-over-year and hard lines and fresh being down a little bit again investing in price. Ancillary and other business gross margin was down a basis point, up a basis point ex gas inflation. In the quarter, higher year-over-year margin contribution in gasoline, hearing aids, business centers and travel was offset by lower year-over-year margin contribution in e-commerce, again investing in price as well as pharmacy lower margins year-over-year. LIFO, I already shared with you, the fact that we had a LIFO credit last year to the tune of $31 million versus zero this year, so year-over-year, that was the 9 basis point delta. And Hurricane Harvey, well, that was the net of two items, so I won\u2019t go through that one, but overall, margins were down relative to last year and we feel it's a function of our own initiatives to drive sales and enhance member loyalty and satisfaction. Moving to reported SG&A, our reported SG&A year-over-year in Q4 was better or lower by 37 basis points and 31 without gas inflation, coming in at 9.97% for the year compared to 10.34% last year. Excluding the Citi Visa benefit, and again the Citi Visa benefit was 8 basis points benefit to SG&A year-over-year or lower. Again, I'll ask you to jot down those four columns, Q3 reported and Q3 without gas and then Q4 reported and Q4 without gas. In terms of core operations, in Q3, plus 21 basis points and plus means good or lower and plus 9 without gas in Q4, plus 32 and plus 27. Central, minus 1 and minus 3 and in Q4, reported and adjusted for gas, plus 8 and plus 7. Stock compensation, minus 1 and minus 1 and then in Q4, zero and zero. Other, minus 5 and minus 5 and then in Q4, minus 3 and minus 3. So reported Q3 lower or plus 14 basis points, reported and flat without gas inflation. And reported, plus 37 or lower by 37 basis points year-over-year and plus 31 or lower by 31 basis points ex gas. And again, each of those numbers, at 37 and 31, you could adjust -- you could look at it from the standpoint that 8 basis points came from the improvement year-over-year related to the Citi Visa card. And while that's been a great improvement each of the last four quarters as it was to margin, we'll start to see that benefit -- we\u2019ll still expect to see some benefit, but it will be greatly reduced after the first full year. In terms of our SG&A performance in Q4, the operations component again was quite good. Strong top line sales frankly led to year-over-year improvement in payroll benefits and other items, particularly bank fees. Central expense was lower year-over-year by 8 basis points and 7 without gas. Again, we saw a nice improvement in payroll and benefit expense percentages, again offset very slightly by a basis point from IT modernization. And lastly, other was worse by 3 basis points that impacted negatively and that was the 11 million I mentioned earlier related to Hurricane Harvey. And next on the income statement is preopening expense. Last year, in Q4, we had 24 million. This year, it was 6 million higher at 30 million. Last year, we opened 11 new units, 11 units, 10 that of relos, 2 of those 11 were international. This year, while we opened up only 1 more, 12 total, 6 were in international, international tend to have higher preopening. Overall, higher year-over-year preopening costs is really a reflection of higher penetration from international. All told, operating income in Q4 came in at 1.450 billion, up 259 million or 22% higher year-over-year than last year's results. Below the operating income line, reported net interest expense came in at 53 million as compared to 39 million last year, primarily a result of the incremental new debt offering we did this past May in conjunction with a special dividend, which was discussed in last quarter's earnings call, plus there's one extra week in Q4 this year than last year. Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by 7 million, coming in at $22 million this year compared to 29 million last year. Within that number, actual interest income for the quarter was better year-over-year by 5 million, however, it was more than offset by that minus 12 million of FX related items I discussed at the beginning of the call. Overall, pretax income was higher by 20% or 238 million higher in Q4, coming in at $1.419 billion this year. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q4 of 17 came in at 34.3% for the quarter compared to 33.6 last year. Again, as I mentioned during the call, we benefited from a few positive discrete items, tax items in both fourth quarters, but our -- but more last year than this year. Our effective rate for the entire fiscal year that we just ended came in at 35.36%. With that, reported net income was higher by 18%, coming in at $919 million this year compared to 779 million in net income reported last year in Q4. Now, for a quick rundown of other topics. The balance sheet is included in today's press release. A couple of balance sheet info items. Depreciation and amortization in Q4 totaled $441 million. So for the entire year, depreciation of $1.370. Our accounts Payable ratio, if you recall last year, we were converting an ITR accounting system, so we paid an extra week of invoices early to make sure we wouldn\u2019t run into any snafus with that conversion on day 1 of the fiscal year that just ended. But adjusting for that, last year, our accounts payable as a percent of inventories was 104%, reported was 85, but 104 taking the adjustment out. It came down to 98% at the end of this fiscal year. If you take construction payables out there and other types of payables that are not merchandise, last year's normalized number at year-end was 91, a little down at 89%, roughly 90% in both year-ends of last year on a merchandise only basis and normalized for that payables early. In terms of average inventory per warehouse, this year fourth quarter end, it was about $12.28 million per location, last year, 11.85 million, so up about $430,000 per location. There is -- that's at the warehouse level. We've broken out this time the increase in inventories elsewhere, because we have quite a bit of expanded inventory with our expansion of e-commerce fulfillment locations and activities as well as some of the vertical integration things we're doing in those businesses. In terms of CapEx, in Q4, we expended $779 million, which for all of 2017 would put us right at $2.5 billion, which is about the same as fiscal \u201916. We\u2019d anticipate spending to be a little higher in fiscal \u201918, not only as it relates to net increase -- relates to the sum of everything we do, not only openings, but also some manufacturing businesses that we\u2019re expanding as well as e-commerce and some other things. Next, in terms of e-commerce, of course in the US, Canada, UK, Mexico, Korea and Taiwan, you should expect additional countries to be open over the next year, year and a half. Total e-commerce sales in fiscal 2017 came in at 4.6 billion, up 15% from right at 4 billion at the end of our fiscal \u201816. For Q4, sales were -- profits were of course up. Total e-commerce sales were up 27% in the quarter. Of course, that includes an extra week, 17 versus 16 weeks and up 21% on a comp sales basis with a trending positive during the -- roughly four months of the quarter. As discussed over the past few quarters, much of our efforts over the past year focused on improving the functionality of our site. We improved search, streamlined the checkout process, improved our members' ability to track their orders and automated much of the returns process and we also improved our online merchandising efforts by adding high end and well-known brand names, a few examples of late, Marmot, Spyder, ExOfficio, GE Appliances and Jiffy Lube Services. We've expanded our KS offerings. We're providing new hot buys, limited time offer with extra discounts. We're also -- we\u2019ve started doing what we called Buyer\u2019s Picks and unique offerings to our partnership, Buyer\u2019s Picks and lastly some unique offerings through partnerships with Citi Visa, where we're offering in the cases we've done it with Samsung Electronics, we've done it with tires and a few other things where you buy it at Costco and you use your Citi Visa card on top of all the other great savings, there's anywhere from a 10% to 15% cash offer. And leveraging as well, we're leveraging our global brick and mortar buying power to expand and improve our online value proposition by lowering prices even further. Lastly, we continue to build awareness on our site with Costco members through warehouse signage, special offers and targeted emails and expect us to discuss some of those activities more in 2018. We feel that all these efforts, which are ongoing have resulted in increased traffic in sales, both online and in-store during the past couple of quarters in particular. Looking forward, we\u2019ll continue to expand these types of activities to drive our businesses. You'll hear more from us in the coming quarters about driving online sales with ongoing site improvements, improved online marketing activities and of course along with great products and services at fantastic prices. That's what we do. In terms of what's new, three days ago, we rolled out two new online delivery related offerings. The first, Costco grocery, which consists of nonperishable food and sundries items. This offers two day delivery on dry grocery and a second, an expanded white label same day grocery delivery offering through our partnership with Instacart that includes both dry and fresh grocery. You can find both sites by going to costco.com and then clicking on the Grocery tab. You'll then be taken to a page offering and explaining both of these new online delivery options. A few details about each option. As it relates to Costco grocery, just under 500 dry grocery SKUs, again no fresh, free delivery with orders over $75, two day or less delivery throughout the continental United States, the boxes are up to 40 pounds shipment through UPS, orders are fulfilled at several of our business delivery centers. These offer very competitive pricing and value proposition, excuse me, in fact significantly better price than even we had at costco.com on many of these items. We\u2019d expect to expand these offerings overtime. The second option, I mentioned, Instacart white label. This is currently offered at 376 of our US locations are live with it and there will be a number of additional US locations planned, added between now and the end of calendar \u201918 as our partnership expands. There are approximately 1700 SKUs, both dry and fresh that are offered and can be fulfilled through the Instacart white label option. Again, I mention that same day delivery and same day delivery, it's also a very competitive pricing value proposition, better than before and again, Costco members will now have access to our promotional pricing like on MVMs as well. Costco executive members will also receive the 2% reward and members utilizing the co-branded Costco Visa card will now earn that 2% on these purchases similar to in-store purchases. It\u2019s just starting this weekend and stay tuned. Next on the discussion list here, warehouse expansion. For fiscal \u201917, we opened 26 net new units, about 3.5% square footage growth. For fiscal \u201918, we\u2019d expect to open about 25 net new warehouses, a little under two thirds of them in the US and about a third internationally as well we plan to relocate six warehouses to better located and larger facilities. That compares to two to three relos in each of the last several years. As of Q4 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 107.3 million square feet. In terms of stock buybacks, in the first three fiscal quarters of 2017, over these 36 weeks, we expended $233 million to buy just under 1.5 million shares at an average price of $156.51, In Q4, these 17 weeks, we expended a little more than that 233, we expanded $240 million for about 1.5 million shares at an average price of 159.21 a share. So for the year, $473 million on stock repurchases, 2.998 million shares repurchased at an average price of $157.87. In terms of dividends, our current dividend stands at $0.50 per share per quarter. That's up 11% from the previous quarterly amount. This yearly $2 per share annualized dividend represents a total payout from the company of approximately $880 million. Finally, before I turn it back for Q&A, I\u2019ll discuss September sales results. For September, which is the five weeks ended this past Sunday, sales for the five week month were 12.4 billion, up 12.1% from the comparable five week period last year of 11.06 billion, they were up, sorry, yeah, they were up 12.1%. On a reported comp basis, September comp sales were up 8.9% and 6.2% after accounting for fluctuation in gas prices and FX. For September, our reported 8.9% comp was a combination of an average transaction increase of 4.1 and again that 4.1 of course includes the benefits from FX and gas at an average shopping frequency of 4.7% worldwide and within the 4.7%, a 5.4% in the US. Gasoline price inflation and FX both contributed possibly in the month. Gas added 160 basis points while FX was favorable in the month by 110 basis points. Cannibalization impacted Canada in September by 325 basis points. As you know, we opened I believe 6 or 7 locations on a base of low-90s this year. So, a lot of cannibalization going on out there, while the US was negatively impacted by 60 basis points and other international by 155. So total company 110 basis points of impact in cannibalization. And as I -- not sure if I mentioned early, e-commerce, comp sales in the month were up 30%. In terms of sales by geographic region, Texas and Midwest, both low double digits were strongest with California and the southeast regions being in the 7% range. Internationally, in local currencies, better performing countries were Japan, Mexico and the UK. In terms of merchandise categories for September, within food and sundries, tobacco, candy and cooler were the leaders. Tobacco of course, we've anniversaried back in June some of the big declines and we're seeing some strength since that point. For hard lines, which was up low double digits, strongest department results were lawn and garden, automotive, tires, consumer electronics and toys. Softlines, which were up in the mid-single digits, housewares, small appliance, domestics and apparel showed strong results, strongest results and in fresh foods, comp sales which were in the mid-single digits again consistent pretty much across most -- all four -- main categories. Within ancillary, gasoline again had very strong comps in the month, driven by both high, both price inflation and the cost of a gallon of gas as well as strong comp gallon growth. In addition, hearing aids were up in the teens and optical was not far behind. Lastly, before I turn it back for Q&A, our fiscal 18 first quarter scheduled earnings release date for the 12 weeks first quarter ending on November 26th, these will be reported after market close on Thursday, December 14 with the earnings call that afternoon at 2 o'clock Pacific time. With that, I\u2019ll be happy to answer questions and I'll turn it over back to Christie. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : I wanted to ask one on membership and I want to ask another on gross margins. So first on membership. The renewal rates have been moderating a little bit and there\u2019s been some explanation behind it, I think there was some credit card friction. And then regarding -- and I'm just curious if that's still the case or what's going on there. And as part of that, the membership growth, can you talk to the composition in the US versus international? Richard Galanti : Yeah. Well, again, in terms of renewal rate, we believe the biggest issue is the auto bill. When we look back at Canada, which occurred a year and a half, two years prior the conversion up there, from its peak renewal rate, I think all the way back to early fiscal \u201915, if I looked out six quarters, it came down about a full percentage point. It's now actually a tenth of a percent above where it was a year -- that year earlier at its peak. So -- and when I look at the -- we\u2019re now 4.5 quarters into it, not 6 and it's down \u2013 again, it was down a full percentage point in the US and recognize it's a little bit different scenario with conversion, but it's down about seven-tenths of a percent. So we believe that's what it is. We don't -- when we look at -- we talk to the members of marketing people and we ask them about what are the reasons when somebody doesn't renew, we get consistent answers of what they've heard for the last several years. So our view at this point is that we're not seeing, we're not concerned about it and want to see what happens over the next couple of quarters if after that it doesn't change. But we assume it will at this point. And I'm sorry \u2013 Simeon Gutman : If you just look at the overall membership, trying to dissect what the US run rate is or how is, I guess, same unit membership trends, I guess if you can try to take out cannibalization, just the direction and what the trend line has been in the US? Richard Galanti : Well, in the US and Canada, which again is 80% of our company, 80 plus percent of our company, it was four. We just did that because we're getting the question every day. We can look at it. I don't have it off -- we didn't do that. We actually was -- we're trying to respond to some of the many questions. I think internationally, particularly since you've got newer units internationally, particularly in Asia and Australia, which is where your impact, less so in Mexico and UK where it\u2019s older, my sense is you'll see the same thing. It will be a positive, but greatly affected by cannibalization. When you've got, in a city in Taiwan, where you've got two very high volume units, which with well over 60,000 members per warehouse and you open up a new one, you're still going to get a lot of new openings, not a lot of new members relative to what we see here, but my guess it's still -- that's going to cause it to come down. So again, it has more to do with timing than anything, cannibalization than anything. I just don't have beyond that. Canada and the US are pretty similar. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then my follow-up was on gross margin and I don't expect you to give a clear answer, because I don't think you give a lot on the outlook, but trying to think of price investment in particular, right, but there's been a pretty favorable trend up until this quarter and I think you said down 3 ex fuel. So I guess, how do you think of the price investment? I know, it's constant for the business, but you'll have some tough compares as you head into the next year, both on a gross margin and an overall EBIT growth perspective. So how do you think of that as the next several quarters play out? Richard Galanti : Well, I mean, in a couple of words, we're fine. I think what we saw this fiscal quarter in terms of sales growth cures a lot of things and driving it with value, we've had the good fortune of having better than expected economics from our new credit card and we certainly -- we are just starting the benefit, if you will, to the membership fee line item, which will start -- continue over the next 20-ish quarters, 20-ish months as the fee increase in the US and Canada. That is again -- that's a fee increase that's about $240 million, peaking 12 months after we started. It takes 23 months because the deferred accounting get in there. So, there's plenty to go around and our view is that we can do both and we feel quite good. Simeon Gutman : Thanks, Richard. Richard Galanti : Let me add one last comment on that, I forgot to mention. The big chunk of it also is penetration of gas. Gas, while gas was great year-over-year, profitability is great. It's a much lower margin business, it's 9 plus percent of our total sales at 500 to 700 less margin -- basis points of margin. So when you've got huge increasing sales price per gallon and 10 plus percent sales growth on 10% of your business, and that aid into it as well. I'll take that lower margin percentage every day for 40-ish million of profits in the quarter. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael Lasser : Richard, on the metric you provided about 4% membership per club growth ex cannibalization in the US and Canada, is it just a coincidence that that's kind of in line with where your traffic has been trending over the last couple of quarters or should we think about it as your traffic growth is highly correlated to that membership growth ex-cannibalization? Richard Galanti : I think they're separate. I mean, a lot of times, I'll give you a simple example. Here in the Seattle region, we have three locations on the east side of the lake, Issaquah, which is across the street from where I am; Kirkland, which is where we used to be and Woodinville, all three kind of aligned north to south on the east side of this Puget Sound. Last November, we opened Redmond, which is where of course Microsoft is headquartered and basically, I think we had as of opening, less than 1000 new sign ups at the Redmond location because we have close to 80% household penetration in the Puget Sound, which is extreme. This is where we're headquartered and we've been forever. We\u2019ve taken the average number of members per location, down from the mid-60s to the low-50s by just adding a new unit, but we\u2019ll add 80 million to 100 million in sales in the first year in this market. So when you've got locations that are doing 250 to 300 plus per unit, you've got to cannibalize them. So, I mean that's an example of that. So I don't think the two are correlated. Michael Lasser : Okay. Just thinking about the comp frequency or the frequency component of your comp, it would seem some of your most longstanding members are probably going to Costco about as much as they can, so is it that the newer members are building their frequency and that's where the bulk of the frequency across your population is growing? Are you seeing growth in frequency across your entire population of members? Richard Galanti : I think it\u2019s over the entire population. First of all, new members -- every new member is going to presumably be more frequent every year for several years. I believe that some of the things we're doing, I didn't give an example on the call here but we've done several e-mail initiatives to members to drive them in-store. We did it over the holidays with New York Strip Steaks at $6.99. We did it with Copper River salmon over just a very limited, I think a ten or so day period. These are little things that little anecdotal things, but we think that we keep doing things to drive even more frequently as well. So I would bet that most of it, since the bulk of our sales come from the numbers that are more than a year, more than two years and more than three years, we're getting them in as well. Michael Lasser : My final question is on September\u2019s frequency growth of 5.4%. There's obviously a lot of moving pieces within landscape in September between the hurricanes, you also had Amazon closed on its acquisition of Whole Foods and there was a lot of noise around that. If you look at your clubs around Whole Foods, was there any impact and what do you think drove such strong frequency growth in September? Richard Galanti : Mel Brooks once said it's merchandising. It\u2019s value and merchandising and some of the other little things we're doing here. As it relates to the tragic things of the hurricanes in Texas and Florida and Puerto Rico, frankly, you get a bill -- whenever there's a pending tragedy that's on the news every day, with this pending tragedy like a hurricane, you get a build-up in sales leading up to it. You're closed for a few days perhaps or more in a couple of locations, but when we look at it -- as I think I mentioned, the comp sales in Texas in September was one of the stronger regions. Now, that's partly because the entire state wasn\u2019t impacted by it. So we don't think that was a big impact at all. As it relates to the publicity and the news and the noise around Amazon Whole Foods, all we can do is perform. When we look at the value proposition, our view is our value proposition got better. You read about Whole Foods having giant increase in member shops or customer shops that first week. I would hope they do and I would expect them to. There's a lot of news out there and there's a lot of things. When we've done our own, we've read about the price changes that the lowering of prices gives us more confidence that our value is even greater. So we\u2019ll have to wait and see and nobody can predict everything. All we know is that our brick and mortar is as strong as it\u2019s ever been and trending in the right direction from there. And we know we've done a lot of, there's 100 different things you do every day. I gave you a couple of the sound bites, the example. So again at this point, we feel pretty good about what we're doing. We feel good that we've got a few delivery Options for our members that frankly are better than the ones they were doing the day before with us or with Instacart or with anybody else. So we feel that to the extent that somebody wants to choose -- to use that route, they'll be able to and we\u2019ll be able to generate the sales from it. Operator : Next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So Richard, I just want to start on SG&A leverage. Right. So both operations in Central, this was about I think as good a quarter as you've had in a long time. Extra week play any role in that? And maybe a little more detail on particularly operations because that you\u2019re down 27, you think about wages, benefits? Richard Galanti : The only benefit is it\u2019s one-sixteenth more of our earnings number. I mean I guess you would have taken that 208 and divided by 17 weeks, but there's not a week with no rent expense in it, because we prorate that daily. John Heinbockel : Yes. So I mean, if you think about it, you sort of -- you think about a sea change here, right, because you\u2019ve typically been up in Central and now down and again, you were down quite a bit more than the third quarter. What is different -- what was different fourth quarter versus third? I'm just curious what was different, how sustainable that is? Richard Galanti : Well, it\u2019s sales. I mean, we hope it\u2019s sustainable. We\u2019ve got a lot of good things going on, but we\u2019re only a little bit better predictor than you guys are at that. We feel good about the initiatives we got going on. We feel good about the monies we have to invest in price and to still drive the other line items of our income statement. And \u2013 John Heinbockel : All right. Then just on the openings, right? So it sounds like maybe 8 or 9, 7 or 8 outside the US. Is that sort of 2 Canada and maybe 6 or 7 other international, and then where in other International? Richard Galanti : I\u2019ll tell you. Yeah. I mean basically, a couple in Canada, two or three, a couple, four or five between the three countries in Asia and another one probably in Australia. That's generally where they are. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then just one last thing, when you think about your delivery options here, what's your sense as to how customers will use those and alter their behavior? Right? So you think about the non-perishable food and sundries on the 2-day, do people simply get, do you think they\u2019ll get those delivered to the home and then come in to buy fresh and nonfood, some of the treasure hunt items and not to have their cards loaded with some of those sundries? How do you sort of get comfort about the impact on traffic to what you're doing? Richard Galanti : Well, needless to say, we have to continue to watch that. We\u2019ve had some limited experience with our relationship with Google starting a few years ago and with Instacart over the last couple of years. What we found so far is it's more fill-in than replacement of a shop and the key is, if you come down a couple or three shops a year, one way as you add several more shops as fill-in or alternative, that's what we saw, but we have very little time and data to feel comfortable about where it will go. We had to keep getting you, we want to do both of course, but we have to keep getting you in store because you're going to buy more and you\u2019re going to see more even if we had everything online, but we don't of course. And one of these I mentioned was, how do we get you in-store. We're just literally scratching the surface of any type of targeted Internet -- e-mail marketing initiatives. We have a very, as you know, a very loyal, hopefully you\u2019re one of them, a loyal member. And we're just scratching the surface with thinking about how to get you in store as well more often. And on the few examples, and several examples that we tried, it's great and we\u2019ll have to see how that goes. I guess the one question that none of us know is [indiscernible] home and order stuff, recognizing you've got to pay for it and no matter who ultimately and there will be several of the lowest cost supplier provider delivering to you at home, there are people that actually want to go out, there are people that actually want to go touch their fresh foods and decide, pick it themselves and it's going to change over time. There's going to be an increasing percentage of online and online delivery and the question is, in brick and mortar, we even asked for years, well, how can you drive sales if you're not offering as many alternatives and whatever else. We've done it with value, in our case, value first and foremost is quality and low price. Over time, the percentage of delivery of fresh will change, how much so, we'll have to wait and see. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Chris Horvers : So first question just on the SG&A front. Can you talk about, the IT headwind was small from a basis point perspective, but of course, the overall top line has accelerated. So as you think about the IT modernization on that central expense line, the underlying dollars, is that dollar growth year-over-year decelerating at this point or when do you think that dollar growth actually decelerates? Richard Galanti : Basically, I think we're in the middle of that. I think it was a quarter or two ago where we actually, it was lower year-over-year by a basis point, and I said, that's on an inflection point. Certainly, even this 1 or 0 basis point this quarter was helped greatly by sales growth. It's going to still increase. I think part of it is where -- we're right at or about to enter our fifth year of modernization. So, that line will start getting fuzzier and fuzzier. We certainly added things to what we are modernizing, taking major systems and doing that we had not contemplated at first. And so my guess is in the next year, assuming regular decent sales, as a percent of sales, a lot of these systems, you spend $60 million or $100 million on one system, it\u2019s kind of like building a building, you start appreciating the day open or the day you turn it on. And it was probably three to four years ago that we started turning a system on in that regard as we complete them. So it will be another year before we've got, if you will, the plate full with these bigger expenses that then amortize over generally five to seven years. So but as sales grows, the denominator in this calculation grows, that will be an offset to it. So I'm shooting from the hip here and as a guest, but all things being equal, sometime in the next year, there is maybe an inflection point, but it's going to be in the one or two basis points either way hopefully and at some point here, we\u2019ll stop talking about it. Chris Horvers : Okay. And then you said on the Visa benefits, the gross margin, SG&A, you\u2019ve said the word, used the term moderate, but not go away. So I think the last quarter, you talked about that sort of -- we're going to start to lap that guys and that's going to go away. So is it just moderation or does it go away and is that \u2013 Richard Galanti : Well, it\u2019s a moderation with a capital M. I think in the first three quarters this fiscal year, the sum of the benefit of improvement to SG&A and margin was 37 or 38 basis points. The aggregate in Q4 was 22. And mind you, a year ago, in Q4, you had a lot of things happening. You were getting off the old program and there was some detriment to that in those last several weeks anyway, the first five weeks of Q4. Then, you had it, but there was also some noise and friction around getting the conversion done for two or three weeks. So my guess is, it will be a much -- it should improve because we're seeing increased penetration of usage. We're seeing increased revenue shift from people saying the value of this card and not only at Costco, but their top of wallet. I forgot if I mentioned it on my part of this call, but using travel as an example. We just added Costco travel to the executive member, first of all, effective September 1, so you get 2% on travel, which you hadn\u2019t gotten before. On top of that, if you use your Costco co-branded Visa Anywhere card, Citi Visa card, you get another 3% by using that on travel. So there's a 5% off unbelievable prices. Chris Horvers : Understood. And then last thing is, you did do -- you talked about the timing in the Groupon, January or earlier and then in August. Can you talk about what the rationale was to do in August? I think a lot of people look out there and say, hey, they see this growth in membership slowing, so sort of a desperation pass to the end zone to buffer the numbers and to the print. So maybe just talk about what the genesis of that was, does it make you -- is it an expression that you're concerned about millennial retention or millennial customer acquisition, just talk broadly about that. Richard Galanti : No, I mean I think first of all, we did it because it works. We don't do it every month or every six months because we don't want to get people comfortable waiting for the next online offering with that added value, with added giftback, gifts in them. We want them to sign up as a member and pay for it. And so it works, the timing difference is simply, we have a lot going on. I believe if I recall, if I look back, we did the fee increase effective June 1 and we didn't want to do it over that month or two period of time. So we pushed it out a little bit. Chris Horvers : And then just from what you've seen in terms of the millennial customer from a renewal rate perspective on these deals going back in time? Richard Galanti : Yeah. Going back to your question though, you asked, do we do it because of concern about millennial, I don't think we're smart enough to understand that. The fact is we do it just to drive membership, we recognize that it has a good millennial benefit. I don't have the one on the one that we just did, but the one we did a year and a half ago and what we did like 2.5 and 3 ago, versus a walk-in, a higher percentage of people that sign up on these LivingSocial or Groupon offers are millennials, not as much as you'd expect and I think it's walking in if I recall correctly. It is like mid \u2013 39% of those that walk in this last one were millennials. I think I\u2019ll go back to the previous one, it was 36% were walk-ins or millennial, whereas millennials under this program, it was like in the mid to high-40s, so about 10 extra percentage points. So not a huge distortion or a difference between those two. But it helps. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : Actually, just on the subject of millennials. Wondering, can you maybe just give us an update a little bit on the average age of your membership? I know, you kind of give that periodically. It seems to have been trending down, any color you can give on that. Richard Galanti : I don't have anything in front of me. I know that what we did a couple of \u2013 not a couple of years, about a year ago, it was looking at US numbers, it was 52 years versus 54 years across the US, not the entire population of US adults, which was about, so we were two years older instead of a few years earlier than that, we were four years older. I have not seen anything since that. If I have a \u2013 you can ask me, I\u2019ll find out, but I don\u2019t recall. Karen Short : Okay. And then one other question I think you were asked, and I didn\u2019t catch the answer, if you gave it. But do you have any color just specifically on the performance of your stores that are in close proximity to Whole Foods since the price reduction were -- took place at Whole Foods. Richard Galanti : Yeah. We essentially overlap everywhere. And I\u2019m not trying to be cute, but other than reading about it on the news and the paper on Wall Street, we have not seen -- we recognized \u2013 I read yesterday that there are some specialties brick and mortar retail stores that are impacted more than others. We don't believe we\u2019ve seen an impact from it. Karen Short : And then I guess on the online grocery, I just want to clarify. You gave 1700 SKUs and I think what you said was that possibly, the price points will possibly be cheaper than Costco, did I catch that right and then --? Richard Galanti : No, no. It will be lowered. Currently, you could go to certain other parties, Google Express, Instacart as was before Octobe1, costco.com Costco Business Center and limited delivery within the 40 or 70 mile radius of those 15 locations, shipped down in the southeast, I believe, boxed. And I'm sure there are some others out there that I\u2019m missing. When we look at the pricing that anybody, both a member and a non-member as the case may be depending on each one, how they price their goods, what they're ultimately have -- what their delivery prices, this is better, including on some of the items which you could buy at great value and better value than those areas on costco.com already. Karen Short : Got it. Okay. And then just a last question, there seems to have been some rumblings that you\u2019re looking to expand into China, I don\u2019t know if you could comment on that a little bit. Richard Galanti : It\u2019s the 20-year discussion as we're looking. As a rule, until we have permits to do something, building permits to do something, we don\u2019t announce whether it's in Alabama or China and, but we're looking and at some point, we'll announce something. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matt Fassler : Richard, my first question relates to the line item that talks about core margin categories on their own sales and I guess that line item, this is inclusive of gas and I might not have caught the number ex-gas, have been up for the first \u2013 Richard Galanti : It's exclusive of gas. Matt Fassler : Okay. So only in core categories. That number had been up I think each quarter of the year and in fact, I think had been up something like 11 straight quarters. Last time it was down I think was in that -- 10 straight quarters -- second quarter of fiscal \u201915 and I know it was flat this quarter and the differences are not very big, but it was a bit of a break in the pattern. So was there any particular area where you invested in price and was there a concerted effort to invest to a greater degree in price that would have led to the increases in that line item data here? Richard Galanti : Yes. But again -- honestly, we don't sit down. We decide like here is a bucket of money, if you will, and how we're going to use it. We don't do a bunch of sensitivity analysis of it. We\u2019re merchants and I\u2019m not, but they are here and we look at what are the things that drive business in retail grocery, or retail non-food as a case maybe and certainly on key items, I think I used the example of New York Strip Steaks where we were $7.99 and $8.99, which \u2013 we went down to $6.99. And by the way, we did that and still made a decent margin because of how we bought it on, we're a giant buyer of this stuff. We've done it on several items and it works. So I think the point you made though is, while it's not a lot directionally, it's different. That's fine. We're really not concerned about that. Matt Fassler : Fair enough. And then secondly, so Instacart, I know, is a prominent delivery partner. I know that prior to Amazon acquiring Whole Foods, Whole Foods had made an equity investment in Instacart, does that have any impact on that partnership on the future of -- and obviously you're not the only partner Instacart has and there is probably a question a lot of their business partners are having, is that a relevant consideration at all as we think about this forward for Instacart? Richard Galanti : No. In fact, what we announced, when we initiated this week our discussions both before and after that, but both before and after June 15 or 16. Matt Fassler : Great. And then finally, the e-commerce business, I know, has accelerated over the past few months and you spoke about the last couple of quarter about some of the changes that you made, re-platforming, et cetera and the capacity you have. Are there any particular categories where you're seeing that acceleration to the extent that you\u2019ve kind of more than doubled the pace of growth in e-commerce, I know you're not doing fresh obviously and you're expanding your e-commerce efforts with some of these brand new initiatives, but anywhere in particular where the business is taking off. Richard Galanti : Well, on the non-foods side, I think we mentioned a quarter or two ago, appliances is a big area. Apparel \u2013 on the non-foods area, [indiscernible] sundries. So we continue, I think, to do a better job on the things on the food and sundry side, on the dry food and sundry side and some big ticket items. And then, I look at some of the examples, again, it was only for what one or two week period, the Samsung deal with using the Citi Visa card on top of great pricing on the TV to start and white glove service if you want it, it was -- you got our great price and if you\u2019re an executive, remember, you got 2% and have used the Citi Visa card, you not only got a 2%, you got that 2% because you bought at Costco. On top of that, you got a 15% cash card. And that impacted sales, both in line -- in store as well as online. So, these are sound bites, but there's lots of them. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : First on membership. I believe the last LivingSocial deal that you ran in 2016, you signed up approximately 250,000 new members through that program or so, could you discuss what the more recent program led to in terms of sign up and then also, the number you gave early on call in terms of the 4% growth in the US and Canada, ex-cannibalization, what would that number be all in, even if we included the club that did see some cannibalization or just kind of overall US maybe versus international growth in membership per club. Richard Galanti : Yeah. I don't have it. I was trying to be helpful to the \u2013 one of the things I guess I want to warn, we're not going to start doing this new calculation every quarter. We try to be helpful here, but we know based on our discussions every day, we can, at the budget meeting, that we felt that we're fine when the question's been asked about the average number of members who are all seems to be going down. The new, total new member signups seems to be \u2013 the rate of growth seems a bit slow a little bit. Again hopefully, the data points I gave you lay those concerns. But I don't have the detail beyond that. What we did is we took, let\u2019s take all the cannibalized units, we know that's a bigger impact and all the new units that many of them are in small markets. That's an impact. That\u2019s going to impact it. Paul Trussell : Understood. And on the LivingSocial sign ups? Richard Galanti : It was a little better than the one 18 months earlier. Paul Trussell : Fair enough. And then just on gross margins, you mentioned at the beginning of the call, the benefit, the pretax benefit had been netted out to about 10 million or so. What line item within gross margins did that impact and also just wanted to enquire what if any margin impact you are assuming from the new Costco grocery rollout? Richard Galanti : Yeah. On the first one, I think it was a separate line item called other. That was the 2 basis points. And as it relates to the impact of the new thing, it\u2019s going to be so small to start with, we don't even know yet. Paul Trussell : Got it. And then just so, on that point, as we think about gross margins over the near term, is it fair that we should think that there could, maybe flat to slightly down would be kind of the near term run rate, just given investments in price that you've made and the moderating contribution from Visa. Richard Galanti : Well, we don't guide. Visa will be moderating, but moderating still has a plus sign in front of us, even if it's small. I look back though as we still have a chunk of those monies, we still have -- we have the new membership fee increase that started in June, with -- again ultimately it's $240 million that increase in just the US and Canada that will hit the P&L, but the total benefit to the P&L line won\u2019t be for 23 months from June. So that\u2019s May of 19. So, but there is plenty of money out there to do both, to be able to \u2013 when the margins go up or down a little bit, again, I get back to it, it is merchandising. We feel we've got plenty of capacity. I think that the salient point is, is any of this related to competitive issues out there? For the most part, no. It's us. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett. Charles Grom : Could you just remind us the profitability of your digital business relative to the club segment and also the SKU overlap between both and what you think the long term opportunity is for the SKU count on the digital side? Richard Galanti : E-commerce profitability is a higher percentage of pretax earnings as a percent of sales in the brick and mortar, but there are a lot of things like that. Some of the ancillary businesses are that way, but it has continued. If it's come down a little, it\u2019s simply because we've invested in price and I would say whatever investment in price is, that number of basis points is less than the reduction in the profitability of e-commerce, because we've driven e-commerce profitability. Charles Grom : Okay. And is that mostly on the merch margin side or has it been on the SG&A side? Richard Galanti : A little of it is SG&A, little of it\u2019s margins. Charles Grom : Okay. And then just a follow-up on Chris\u2019 question earlier about the millennials, could you speak to membership trends and renewal rates for that category or for that cohort of individuals? Richard Galanti : I don't have any new data on that other than I think what I shared last quarter. Millennials, new members generally renew at a lower rate. Every year, you're stuck around, you're going to renew at a better higher rate until you're really old. And millennials linear renew at about the same rate, at least that\u2019s always, it offers your members. Yeah. And in fact, I remember, I don\u2019t have the detail on the one we just did, but the one we did 18 months ago versus walk-in, we saw those that signed up on LivingSocial renewed at like a percentage point higher rate in that first year of renewal. But again that's plus or minus a little. Charles Grom : Okay. And then just my last question is obviously the compression in your renewal rates and the timing of the Amazon Whole Foods deal has sort of given a lot of people concern and there's obviously a focal point on the call and I wanted to circle back to Simeon\u2019s question earlier, in your answer to his question with regards to Canada, because I think it gives you a good proxy for sort of a pathway for the renewal rate subsequent to the change in tender. So could you just remind us and just go over that again. You said that peak to trough was around 100 basis points from the time you rolled out that new credit card and what was the recovery time and therefore you think it's going to be another quarter or two before your renewal rates ticked up, can you just kind of discuss that because I think it\u2019s pretty important? Richard Galanti : Yes. And mind you, there's still some differences and nuance differences between Canada and the US, but notwithstanding those differences, Canada, I think we did the transition in early fiscal \u201915, September of \u201914, which was Q1 of \u201915 and we were in Canada. And then if I look out six months later, it dropped -- it continue to drop for six quarters and it dropped exactly -- and I mean \u2013 but it dropped 1.0 percentage points. The next couple of quarters, it ticked up half of the delta and it took another couple of quarters to pick up all of the delta. Another quarter plus to pick up the rest of the delta. This year, we did -- we converted in Q4 of \u201816. So we're now in the fourth quarter past that, whereas, I saw the trough in Canada, albeit some differences and nuances, six quarters out. So that would tell me, it's probably a couple of more quarters, but that\u2019s about as much analysis as we've done. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Oliver Chen : Richard, as you do think about e-commerce and you become much more aggressive and considerate about what your strategies are, what are your thoughts about the framework for balancing e-commerce and the convenience factor against margins and cost control from a CapEx and expense perspective, what\u2019s your framework for how you're thinking about evaluating where you should allocate ROIC for the long term. And our second question was just about the value proposition story, which continues to be very compelling. How are you triangulating the value proposition against core merchandise margin and also working through with vendors in terms of maximizing it for the whole system and sharing and passing on some savings to customers. And that's also a little bit related to the multi-vendor Mailer and where you are with that project? Thank you. Richard Galanti : It's all of the above. First of all, in terms of allocation, first of all, the base e-commerce as we\u2019ve gone to more fulfillment centers, we frankly -- it\u2019s been a net positive because we\u2019ve driven down transportation costs, freight costs, we've driven down time to get it to you. The improvements, the costs of the improvements to the site are de minimis. It's just that perhaps we were a little stubborn for a long time and we hadn\u2019t done it. It wasn\u2019t our focus, but improving search, improving the site itself, expanding distribution points, those are small pieces of a $2.5 billion CapEx budget. So I don't really see that, we've got more than enough money to do it. As it relates to driving business, some of these things are text clearly. Someone else earlier asked the question, what if this thing with grocery is really successful. Well, really successful is two things. It's really successful as a business and how does it impact the people coming into -- walking into Costco, because we know we're going to buy really a lot more stuff when they walk in. So we have to do that and we think we can manage that by using email to drive people in store as well and the couponing and things like that. So again, time will tell and we\u2019ll have to see where it goes. As it relates to working with vendors, it's pretty simple. Based to the volume and the efficiencies that we bring to purchasing a product from a vendor, we better get the best price and we all hear and sometimes we read and sometimes somebody accidentally sends us something, but we all hear about all the special deals out of one retailer, whether brick and mortar or someone else. I think like all of us out there, we have to keep our options open, but we feel pretty good about we\u2019re getting money. Some of the successes we've had, whether it's the special deals and the example of the special deals, working with vendors on hot items and the Buyer\u2019s Picks, when I spoke about last February or early March in the second quarter earnings call about, in some cases, tweaking some types -- differently tweaking how we use the MVM and what I was doing with, how we drive greater value and sometimes partnering with the vendor to do that, all those things are part of the equation. I think it's a lot easier for us to do it when we're trying to manage a few thousand items at the enormity of purchasing power we have within those items and the availability of sourcing those items from many people. So I think we feel pretty good about what we're doing and how we're getting the monies and how we\u2019re spending them, and there's a lot going on. We\u2019ll have to wait to see. We\u2019re gratified that the things we're doing are driving brick and mortar traffic and comps and we're gratified by some of the things that we were telling you over the last few quarters of earnings calls about improving the site, adding a few things, have started coming to fruition on e-commerce. We think some of these new things, we're excited about it, but there's a lot of unknowns yet. A comment from somebody in the room here mentioned, I think appliance is a great example. It used to be, we sold some appliances in-store and other big ticket items like furniture. And if you know we don't deliver and you\u2019ll get your U-Haul or your pickup -- your friend\u2019s pickup truck, well, that\u2019s not happening today. By displaying some items in store, we're driving more business, we're doing very well online with furniture, with patio furniture, with regular furniture, with lawn and garden type big ticket items, with electronics, including white glove service and now with appliances. We think appliances, part of it also is brands, having partnerships with GE and LG and Samsung among others, which are relatively new in the way we're doing it, we think in literally three or so years, we can add $1 billion of sales, which we\u2019ve started doing about 8 months ago. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict from Robert Baird. Peter Benedict : You mentioned the manufacturing facilities during your prepared remarks. Can you talk a little bit more just about what you've done there and what kind of the strategy is and some of the benefits you see when you start to take some of that stuff in-house? Thank you. Richard Galanti : Well that's a continuation of some things we've done. Years ago, we opened our first ground beef plant, I think it was originally in Tracy, California and the intention was -- is to one, assure supply and two, by definition have great quality, but in two, lower the price per pound of landed ground beef to our locations. We did that and more. We now have a plant in California that supplies us. It's our planet, 4 plus million pounds a week, over half a dozen SKUs. We're building a second plant on the East Coast right now because this one has been beyond capacity for a few years, but we now can accommodate one in the East Coast and by the way reduce some freight costs along the way, so we\u2019ll get more efficiencies from that. The $300 million we're spending on a chicken plant in Nebraska just broke ground a month or two ago. We need over 400 million birds in the US every year. This will be less than about 100 million, so just under a quarter of our need. More importantly, we've got two other plants run by other well-known suppliers where we, we call them dedicated facilities. We had to retrofit them, greatly reduce the number of SKUs they\u2019re supplying and manufacturing to supermarkets, restaurants and us and other clubs and driving, guess what, if you are to greatly reduced the SKUs, you make the manufacturing more efficient, you can save, given the weak and given what happens with all the byproduct and the markets themselves, we can guarantee sourcing and lower our costs by anywhere from $0.10 to $0.35 a bird depending on what month and what's going on out there in the markets. So it has worked well for us. We're looking to do that and other things and the fact that we source produce from 44 countries, it's what's make -- it is what makes us who we are, but we're sourcing 30 SKUs or so, not 150 SKUs. We\u2019re building -- in Canada, we\u2019ve built a commissary for baking these. We've got \u2013 so we\u2019ll continue to do that, but I think the biggest single commitment we've made is this new chicken plant, but it's not likely gone from zero to 300 million in this example. We've done a lot of things. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : I know we're late, but I wanted to just kind of attack the elephant in the room. We\u2019ve had a lot of questions on kind of memberships and I think the elephant in the room basically, it's the old Peter Lynch of investing, invest in what you know and I think a lot of people in the investment community have seen, if they\u2019re Costco members, maybe have seen that their shopping frequency to Costco drop as Amazon's come in with things like subscribe and save and other programs that they've done. So Richard, what I wanted to, I mean, clearly, your sales are just amazing, like they speed up and they speed up and they speed up in your frequency, what are we missing in the investment community, where again it's the old Peter Lynch thing kind of invest in what you know where our experiences, I think, collectively and I hear from a lot of investors, but I also have experienced myself in my own household, we're going to Costco less and yet, your sales are so darn strong, what are we missing and why do you think we're missing it. Richard Galanti : I wish it was the easy explanation. We don\u2019t see it and that's not a good -- it's a good answer from the standpoint that we don't see it and that's good, it\u2019s in the numbers. To the extent, clearly, you've done some sampling yourself, Scott, others have as well. Some of that sampling shows what you just suggested that it appears that, including your family. Others, it doesn't show that. I don't know why. What we know is that we feel good, well, certainly, we feel good about comps and frequency and renewal rates, subject to the \u2013 to some of the credit card stuff. We feel good about some of the things we're getting ready to offer. If this stuff is being sold out there at higher prices and now we're going to -- those prices are going to be even lowered further by us with one and two day delivery or with, the first, one day, same day delivery with fresh, we have to figure out how to communicate that to everybody. But that should continue to drive more business. We\u2019ll see. I don't have a good answer for that one. I think part of it is, if you take, using the supermarket grocery industry, the roughly whatever it is, 900 billion or $1 trillion industry, everybody out there on this call and elsewhere will have their estimate of what delivery and online will be as a percentage of the total. If whatever it is today, it'll be more tomorrow and it will be more the next day. I think everybody, even though has extreme assumption is it\u2019s not going to be 100% ever. The question is, is it going to go from and making these numbers up from 5 to 10 and then slow down, is it going to go to 20 or 25, is it going to go to 40, who the hell knows. Whatever it\u2019s going to be, we should have a piece of it, but clearly, whatever that brick and mortar and people actually drive somewhere and get in themselves, I think we're going to keep taking pieces of that. An extreme example is not even on grocery, it\u2019s on apparel. We have a six plus billion dollar apparel business that\u2019s compounded for 3.5 years at 9 plus percent, while the brick and mortar apparel is down. I know why and we've explained why. So for every point, there seems to be a counter point. Within grocery itself, part of it's the unique items, whether it's Kirkland Signature items or some of the things we do uniquely ourselves, all those things hopefully will get in. If we can\u2019t get you to come in for it, we will at least get you to come in occasionally, buy some of the things we do that drive you it like the strip stakes or like the Copper River salmon or like organics and to the extent if you want to pay a little more, that little more will be a lot less more than it was the day before, even through us. So that's what we're going to do. Scott Mushkin : Yeah. I mean I think right now, it seems like with the strength of the business, our experience maybe on the investment community is a little different than what's going on for a lot of people. Hey, I had just one last one on the $75 free delivery, I've been on the site during the call. If you sell items and you deliver for free for over $75 of the order size, are the profits equivalent there with going to the store and then thanks for letting the call go so long. Richard Galanti : Repeat the question, somebody was mentioning something. Scott Mushkin : Yes. So I mean basically, if it's $75, the delivery is free. What -- is the profit equivalent if I go over $75 and I buy on this Costco grocery, is the profit equivalent there versus the store? Richard Galanti : Yes. Scott Mushkin : Yes. All right. Again thanks for taking my question. Thanks for letting the call go so long. Richard Galanti : Yes. No worries. And part of that by the way is what we do. I mean it's a huge volume that we\u2019re doing, like any deliverer out there, including some of the ones that deliver our stuff and they\u2019re doing stuff third party with us, it's all about getting more things on the box. If we get you to maximize that shipment, that goes a big way. If we get the volume that we can bring to the table when third party shippers are also looking for more volume and to spread that volume, that's all good for us. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies. Dan Binder : On the topic of e-commerce, you talked about the higher profitability of an online sale. I'm just curious if you were to take a dollar of sales out of the club and transfer it to online, does the better profit online completely offset the deleverage of pulling that dollar out of the club. Richard Galanti : It took me a long time before we figure that out. At the end of the day, if all we\u2019re doing is substituting and taking sales out of brick and mortar and doing it online, that's a loss and that's a money losing proposition. The fact of the matter is, if we're going to lose it, a, we should lose it to ourselves and b, can we drive more business anyway, both in-store and online. The fact that you can get under this Costco grocery dry items throughout the entire Continental United States within a year, 90% of it already, starting two days ago, that includes lots of geographies where there's not a Costco within 150, 200 miles. So we think that we're going to drive some business outside of our existing members and by the way, they're going to come remember to do this. So they're really doing it despite ourselves online with a limited amount of things we had at a higher price. So we think that, will there be some, will somebody stop becoming a Costco member? Sure. There's going to be somebody. Will somebody shop less on in-store because they\u2019re now infilling or fulfilling some of that with buying direct? Yes. But, will there be new people that do it before? Absolutely. And will we figure out how to get you in the store even if you don't want to drive to the store? Yes. And we've been pleasantly surprised by some little things we've done to do that. People like deals and we do deals better than anybody. Dan Binder : Second question was around renewal rates. You talked about the next couple of quarters possibly before you see that inflection. If I go back far enough, I can recall cycles where you had membership fee increases, where the renewal rate would come off a little bit, not a lot. I think the last cycle, you didn't see that. I'm just curious as you look -- because you just raised membership fees, is it possible that that renewal rate takes a little bit longer than just a couple of quarters until you lap that fee increase next year? Richard Galanti : I think it's possible. I think what you're talking about originally though is when we do an increase, you'd see almost an immediate drop in renewal rate for about a year that it gets backed up and it\u2019s continuing on. I think it's been like, at least two, if not three cycles of 10 to 15 years prior to that when we saw that. Recognizing, there's other things that have made you want to renew your membership, having gas stations, having fresh foods, becoming the executive member, all those things have helped that as well. So it's hard to dissect it in that regard. Anecdotally, what we hear from -- again from membership and from membership when they survey members that have dropped that it has nothing to -- virtually nothing to do with raising the fee. Dan Binder : Okay. Just two other questions. On the promotional front, if I go back a couple of quarters ago, it looked like you were pulling back on the MVM, hit the sales a little bit, but over the years, it\u2019s gotten a little bit more business on promotion, maybe a little less on EDLP, there\u2019s been a little bit of a shift, and now I'm just listening to the call today, it sounds like you're going to be more active online. So I guess just in terms of how it fits into the message to the customer about everyday low price and whether they should wait for that promotion, do you feel like you're -- you have the right balance today or do you think there will be further tweaks as you do more online, take away some of the MVM in the club? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, the letter E means every day. What we talked about -- what we changed back in February-ish, we\u2019ve continue. What I mentioned -- I gave a couple of examples what we\u2019ve done online of late. So it's not substituting something else. The view is -- our collective view is that there's -- we have the ability to do all the above and we're doing it. Dan Binder : Okay. And then my last question was just around traffic, both I think in September and the quarter and I think actually for quite a while, the US traffic, or at least a couple of quarters, the US traffic has been better than international. I was just curious with a younger international store base, why would that traffic be softer? Is it strictly cannibalization or is it something more than that as you compare it to the US traffic growth? Richard Galanti : I think it\u2019s two things. It\u2019s cannibalization and the newness of the \u2013 it\u2019s cannibalization and new members in any state or any country and that first renewal is less than the second year renewals, less than the third year\u2019s. So every time they renew, they\u2019re more likely to renew the next year at a higher rate than the previous year class if you will. And so we've got newer market units and we have cannibalization. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO. Kelly Bania : Just a couple more questions on the two new online initiatives. I guess, first, how will the prices compare for each of them to the stores in the club. I believe Instacart has two different models, one where the prices actually matched the in-store prices, but I believe there's a margin impact for that for the retailer. So just any comments on how we should expect or what the message to members will be on how prices will be on the online versus in the club? And then are there any plans in terms of testing some more auto replenishment type programs along with this and any plans to market or advertise this in a meaningful way. Richard Galanti : On the latter part, I believe there's something already on the site in terms of auto replenishment. That\u2019s over there. I\u2019m sorry, it does replenishment in terms of the list of based on you bought before. And again, yes, that will be tweaked, but that was first order business to get out there. First of all, in terms of Instacart having two different models, the same prices in store or not, I don\u2019t think they only have one model with us currently, prior to this week. And which included, however they charge for delivery or they markup our goods. So this will be lower when you go on to Instacart and even lower when you go on to Costco grocery or Costco e-commerce. Did I answer that? Operator : Next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky : When you're looking at the various reasons people shop at the Costco clubs, are you able to look at just how much they enjoy their shopping experience, you've got great sales numbers and there's a lot of reasons to be in the store, but is there just a factor that indicates people enjoy being in the club. Richard Galanti : Well, I\u2019m biased, but of course, we all enjoy being in a club. What was first part of your question? Chuck Cerankosky : Well, you've got various reasons like saving money to go to a Costco club and high quality, but is there just flat out simply an experiential reason to be in the clubs that is driving traffic numbers that are better than a lot of other brick and mortar retail? Richard Galanti : Well, I think it\u2019s several, well, Chuck and again, I am biased, it\u2019s several things. The gas station\u2019s help to fresh foods is second to none. And in our view, that\u2019s even got -- the amount around that has gotten bigger, not smaller since June. There's Kirkland Signature items, there's Treasure Hunt fresh. There's organics, I mean I think this is what we do. When I go to the budget meetings every four weeks and I look at even some of the things we've got coming in for the various holidays, whether it's outerwear, apparel for the winter or some of the holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, just, I think our members are -- should be as excited as ever about some of the exciting new things we have. They keep driving that value proposition. And all the things that I mentioned earlier in the call, the tweaking of the MVM, the -- using the emails to get you into buy, when everybody out there was $8.99 to $10.99 on choice, New York Strip Steaks, we went from $7.99 to $6.99. That not only drives business and it takes it away from chicken and ground beef, it drives traffic. And we know how to do that kind of stuff pretty well. Chuck Cerankosky : Going back to membership, our work has been showing that household formations are looking a little better than the census numbers, which are about 1 million new households per year right now. Are you seeing that in membership sign ups in the US? Richard Galanti : New households? I don't know. If you want to me email me the question, I can find out. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Rob Iannarone : Rob Iannarone on for Scot Ciccarelli. Just one housekeeping item. Organic sales, can you tell us how much that was for the year? Richard Galanti : Organic? It was up a little over 20% and about 5.5 billion. Rob Iannarone : Great. And one follow-up also food related here. Anything you're seeing changing in either inflation/deflation, has the preliminary conversation changed with any of the suppliers you talk to? Richard Galanti : It's pretty stable. I mean, everybody's hoping for a little -- well, we're not hoping for inflation, everybody's hoping for inflation. Again, it doesn't hurt us, but it's been pretty stable. I mean if I look at LIFO indices or any type of those metrics, we've gone from deflation to flat or literally low single digit basis points up on a basket. Taking gas out of the equation, which is quite inflationary right now. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joe Feldman : Two quick ones. Pick up in store, I know we've talked about this before with you guys, but just curious if you\u2019ve changed your thinking on it at all or if there's any potential to do a test like a bottom line pickup in store situation. Richard Galanti : Yes. We look at it, but at this point, we\u2019re not prepared to do it. We do with tires. You can order them online and schedule your appointment. Joe Feldman : Got it. Is it a space issue or a labor issue you think? Richard Galanti : Well, it's -- first of all, to tell you the truth, in our view and maybe we're stubborn, it's a common sense issue. You order and then you've gotten, we have separated, it's a dry refrigerated frozen wait for you and it's clearly a space issue. I mean, we're doing literally twice the volume of some others out there, two to three times the volume versus our two direct competitors and I'm sure at some point, we\u2019ll try it, but it's not on the agenda in the next couple of months. Joe Feldman : Got it. And then the other topic, I think you said the store mix for this year, new stores was two-thirds US, one-third International, I feel like that you were trying to push more towards 50-50 the past couple of years, just anything to do that you can mention there. Richard Galanti : We\u2019re still trying and just there's a longer pipeline and we\u2019ve had a lot going on. So there's, we will get there and I look at it and I think the good news is, if you had asked me five, six, seven years ago, I don't think we'd have as many opportunities in the US as we still think we have. I mean saturation continues, but that the time with saturation ultimately occurs for new locations, keeps -- being pushed out a little bit further. Why don\u2019t we take two last questions? Operator : Okay. We\u2019ve got two more questions left. The next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. David Bellinger : Hi. This is David Bellinger on for Brian. So my first question is on the price investments you detailed earlier. Just to be clear, did those step up in Q4 versus the trend over the first three quarters of the year and if so, was that in some way a reaction to the Amazon Whole Foods deal. Richard Galanti : No. They didn\u2019t other than there\u2019s more weeks, there's 17 weeks versus the first three quarters that had 12 weeks and it had absolutely nothing to do with that. I mean, we priced Whole Foods twice a week in many, many markets around the country and we're kind of scratching our head. And we did that before the announcement of the acquisition by the way. Have they come down in prices of some items? Sure. Overall, and some of you have done your own price baskets, while we read about up to 43%, it's a lot closer to 0 than it is 43%. And even with something dramatic, others out there will be impacted a lot more than we are. Other than people wanting to have stuff delivered and we're providing that option based on how we do stuff. David Bellinger : Got it. And then as my follow up, can you just give us any comments around the recent trajectory of food price deflation and what your expectations are going into 2018? Richard Galanti : It's pretty flat right now. Within fresh, you're going to see variations like meat has come down a little bit. It was way up for a year, but that's going to be seasonal. Produce depends on props, recent events, oil, gasoline depends on recent events, the hurricanes, but other than that, taking some of those things out, it's pretty flat. Operator : The last question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : I wanted to ask, can you give the percentage of sales that Kirkland Signature represents and then just curious if you think about the margins relative to what else is in store, given increasing competition out there and obviously the favorability of the KS product, would you think about increasing the offering there going forward to help sort of fund offer uniqueness within the store? Richard Galanti : Yeah. Well, percentage wise, ex gasoline, even though, it says Kirkland Signature gasoline is about 24%, 25% of our total sales are non-gas sales, we\u2019ll continue to add items as they make sense. We're not really working towards the number and we think the number will keep going up a little bit, because we do like it, but we've also -- we've tried -- we remind ourselves, our head of merchandising reminds our buyers every day, don't fall in love with it, because it has your name on it and each year, which items, even Kirkland Signature, we just continue because the brand does better, maybe ours is a better value in our minds and maybe it is a better value, but we're still not successful with it. And by the way, part of the focus of our buyers probably before that is to find more brands, we want more brands. Mark Astrachan : Got it. And then just lastly, you had previously talked about e-commerce expansion being done organically, curious if that's still the case or would you potentially take a look at other things, whether it's national retailer or it\u2019s a logistics provider, something that can help sort of bridge what you're doing externally now with something internally and related to that sort of views on competitive dynamics, meaning you buy something that isn't necessarily something you want, but something that somebody else may want that ultimately could negatively impact your business? Richard Galanti : I think on the latter part of that, no. That\u2019s going to be the last thing. I always joke, we're not smart enough to figure that one out. I think that we're likely to first of all look for partnerships and ventures to jointly venture something rather than to buy something. As you might expect, we along with other large consumer retailers, get calls every day about everything, whether it's delivery services, food related meal stuff, all kinds of stuff and we're fortunate in the sense that one, we've got some good relationships like this recent expansion, what we're doing with Instacart. That helps. So I don't see us doing that. That being said, we\u2019ll be open minded to anything. But we'll have to wait and see on that one. We've gotten a lot going on right now with some of the things we're doing that we're excited about and every time, when we tried something, I keep bringing up the steak idea or the steak example or the Copper River salmon answer, then we figure out what else can we do. And there's a lot of those what elses. And so we've got our plate pretty full on those kind of things and we've got to, look, we just rolled this thing out, it\u2019s -- what we rolled out three days ago is a soft opening if you will. There's no publicity out there for it. We have to see how it goes, what it does first. Mark Astrachan : Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Have a good day. Operator : There are no more audio questions at this time. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Christy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Costco Wholesale Corporation First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to CFO, Richard Galanti. You may begin. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Christy, and good afternoon to everyone. I'll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal '18, the 12 weeks ended November 26. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $640 million or $1.455 a share. That's a 17% increase compared to last year's first quarter results of $545 million or $1.24 a share. In comparing the year-over-year results, there were two items noted in today's release. First one, this year's first quarter had benefited from a $41 million or $0.09 a share income tax benefit related to a change in accounting rules for stock-based compensation. And secondly, last year's first quarter results benefited from a non-recurring $51 million legal settlement. This $51 million figure represented a 19-basis point benefits in gross margin and a benefit to the first quarter 2017 earnings per share of $0.07 a share. So excluding those two items, the reported 17% integration earnings would have been up 16%. A variety of other items impacted the year-over-year comparison. To the positive, gasoline profitability was higher year-over-year as was, to a lesser extent, incremental events, incremental benefit from our co-branded credit card program metrics. Offsetting these year-over-year positives were costs related to Hurricanes Irma and Maria and the slightly higher year-over-year normalized income tax rate, about 70 basis points. Now turning to the income statement I'll start with a sales. Net sales for the first quarter were $31.12 billion, a 13.3% increase from last year's $27.47 billion, while this year's 12-week quarter included one less sales day in the United States than the first quarter of last year due to the calendar shift for Thanksgiving. Our pre-thanksgiving and Black Friday holiday weekend sales fell into the first quarter this year compared to a fall into the second quarter last year. Combined, these two factors produced an estimated net benefit to this year's first quarter sales results by an estimated 1.5% in the U.S. and about 1.3% worldwide. As you saw on the released today, reported U.S. comparable sales increase was 10.3. Ex-gas and FX, the 10.3 was an 8.7. Canada was reported at 11.3, ex-gas and FX was a 4.3; Other International, a plus 10.1 reported, and ex-gas and FX, 8.2. All told, the total company was a 10.5 reported and a 7.9 after taking on the effects of gas inflation and FX. E-commerce, which we several months ago started reporting each month. For the 12 weeks, e-commerce comp sales were 43.5% up. And ex-gas inflation -- I'm sorry, ex-FX, it was a 42.1%. Now this number includes the holiday shift of Thanksgiving, but it's a little different than in-store because of Cyber Monday and we estimate that somewhere north of 5% and perhaps up to 10% of benefit and that number; so that 42 would come down a little bit if you'd normalized it. Still a very strong number.  In terms of Q1 sales metric, first quarter traffic was up 5.9% worldwide and 6.6% in the U.S. Again, these two figures positively impacted by the Thanksgiving holiday shift as just discussed. FX impacted total sales by about 110 basis points and gasoline inflation contributed another 142 basis points. So gas and FX together for the entire company was about 2.5 percentage points, 250 basis points. As well, cannibalization weighed in on comps to the tune of minus 105 basis points. For the last several quarters, we've had more impact from that as we -- in several more reloads than we had done in the past. Average running transaction or ticket was 4.3%, and again, a little over half of that, which was the gas and FX benefit; so about a little over 2% normalized transaction figure.  Next to the income statement, membership fees; Reported in Q1, $692 million, that's up $62 million or 9.8% year-over-year and seven basis points. Now that $62 million increase in fees, about $24 million of the $62 million increase related to membership fee increases. About 3/4 of that $24 million membership fee increase benefit came from the fee increases we took in the U.S. and Canada effective June 1, 2017. And the balance from the fee increases taken in September of '16 or at the beginning of Q1 '17 and our other international operations, that is just back again to September of '16; but all told, that plus $24 million is in that plus $62 million. So ex that $24 million, we were still -- have been up 6% and up in the low-to-mid 5% range if you take out the FX benefit. We would expect, by the way, to see the impact of the fee increase based on how it impacts the income statement overtime with deferred accounting to continue to be even more positive year-over-year delta in the upcoming three or so quarters. Our membership renewal rates were -- came in at 90.0% in the U.S. and Canada and 87.2% worldwide. These are the same renewal percentage figures we had at the end of the previous fiscal quarter at Q4 of '17. In terms of number of membership Q1 end -- in terms of total households, at Q4 end, we had 49.4 million. We ended Q1 in 12 weeks later with 49.9 million, up a little over -- up right at 1% during the 12 weeks. And total cardholders at Q4 end 12 weeks ago, we had 90.3 million cardholders, now 91.5 million. In terms of paid Executive Members, they stand at 18.8 million and that's an increase of about 246,000 over the past 12 weeks here. We are still being able to convert and add new Executive Members at the rate of about 21,000 a week in the quarter. In terms of -- and mentioned earlier, terms of membership portion release related to the recent annual increase, that year-over-year number will continue to increase and we'll share that with you in each quarter going forward. Going down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin first quarter was lower year-over-year by 33 basis points. I'll ask you to just jot down two columns of numbers, not 4, just for first quarter and basically what we reported for Q1 '18, and the second column would be without gas inflation because that was impactful to understanding the numbers. The first line item is merchandise core. Year-over-year and on a reported basis, it was down 12 basis points. Ex-gas inflation, it was flat or 0. Ancillary businesses, plus 600 on a reported basis and plus 9, ex-gas inflation. 2% Reward, minus one basis point and minus two basis points. Other, minus 26 and minus 26. So all told in total on a reported basis, that was a minus three if you add up those numbers. And ex-gas inflation, it was minus 19. Now overall, again, it was 33 excluding the 19 -- excluding the benefit from the non-recurring $51 million legal settlement last year, that was 19 basis points. Again, the total gross margin was lower year-over-year by 14 and was flat excluding gas deflation -- gas inflation. The core merchandise component margin was lower by 12, as you can see on the chart, but again, flat excluding gas price inflation for the quarter. And within the subcategories within core, food, sundries and soft lines merchandise departments, year-over-year in Q1 were up, and hard lines and fresh foods year-over-year were down. The ancillary and other business gross margins, again, on the chart I just shared with you, plus 6 basis points and plus nine ex-gas inflation. Higher year-over-year margin contribution came from gas, hearing aids and hearing aids mostly, offset by lower year-over-year margin contributions and pharmacy, e-commerce and food court. In terms of the 2% Reward and the fact that, that hits margin by a little bit indicates the fact that we're still getting higher penetration of sales from members -- increasing penetration of sales from members that opted to become an Executive Member. Lastly, in others, we had the positive non-recurring legal year-over-year settlement that was a 19 basis point number. Most of the rest is some incremental costs of this year primarily related to a new centralized return facilities. Going back two or three years ago, we tested this in one region, and in the last several months, we rolled out two the entire United States. And so there'll be some small incremental costs related to that, that hits the margin in each of the next couple of quarters. Moving to reported SG&A our SG&A percentage in Q1 year-over-year was lower or better by 34 basis points. More importantly, I think, ex-gas inflation, it was still better or lower by 20 basis points. Again, on a reported basis, it came in at 10.3 -- 10.36%. Doing the little chart again, the two columns reported and without gas inflation, core operations, lower or better by 24 basis points. Put a plus sign in front of that. And ex-gas inflation, plus 12. Central, plus 8, and ex-gas, plus 7; stock compensation, plus two and plus 1; total reported, lower or better, plus 34 basis points, and ex-gas, plus 20 basis points or lower by 20 basis points. Now looking again at the chart, the operations component was lower or better by 24 basis points and better by 12 ex-gas inflation. This basically is a function of strong top line sales. As you know, we've reported in each of the last several months today in the quarter very strong sales, both in-store and online. Central expense also, lower by 8 basis points or seven without gas. Again, when we looked through all the detail, first and foremost, it is a strong sales results. No real surprises here. As we've been told, higher sales drive slower SG&A. Next, for the income statement. Preopening, $5 million lower this year in Q1 coming in at $17 million compared to $22 million, really a function of opening schedule. This year in Q1, we opened seven openings, five net new openings plus two relows, all in North America. And last year in Q1, we opened 9, 8 of which were net new but nine openings, again, all in North America. All told, reported operating income in Q1 came in at $951 million, up $102 million or 12% higher year-over-year. And excluding the legal settlement, basically it was up -- would have been up $153 million from an adjusted $849 million last year, we are up 19% without that legal settlement. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was up $8 million year-over-year at $37 million this year in Q1 compared to $29 million a year earlier. Higher year-over-year basically because of the result of the dead offering we did this past May in conjunction with our special dividend. Interest in income and other was lower year-over-year by $4 million. Actual interest income in the quarter was better by $5 million; however, it was more than offset by about a $9 million impact, negative impact from FX contracts, FX-related items, not just contracts. Those fluctuate plus or minus that amount, it seems, each quarter based on how we manage foreign currency payables in to the countries around the world. Overall, pretax income was higher by 11% or $90 million in the quarter, coming in at $936 million, up $141 million or up 18% excluding the $51 million onetime legal settlement benefit last year in Q1. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q1 '18 came in at 30.4% for the quarter, last year was 34.4%. On a normalized basis, again, taking out that usual item that we've mentioned in the press today, last year's tax rate would have come in -- last year, there was a small incremental difference. Last year without normalized tax rate would have been a 34.1%, which would again have been lower by about 70 basis points than this year's normalized tax rate of 34.8%, taking that out item that we mentioned in the press release. As I mentioned earlier in the call, again, we mentioned that positive discrete tax items this year. Overall, reported net income was higher by 17% coming in at $640 million compared to last $545 million. And again, excluding the two items, that's the one on the tax side, excluding the two items on the press release, net income would have been higher by 16 percentage points. A few other items of note before we turn it over to Q&A. Capital expenditures were $820 million and we would expect for the year for it to still be in the mid-to-high 2s, and depreciation at $335 million. Warehouse expansion; so I think we've talked about somewhere between 20 and 25 openings. Over half of them will be in the U.S. We expect three in Canada, two in Korea and one each in Australia and Mexico. As well, we plan to relocate six warehouses this year, four in the U.S. and two in Canada. And that, again, compares to two or three a year in recent years. We will procure a few extra in fiscal '16 as well -- fiscal '17 as well. As of Q1 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 108 million square feet. In terms of stock buybacks, in all fiscal '17, we spent $473 million for just under 3 million shares at an average price of $157.87. In the first quarter, we repurchased 734,000 shares for $119 million or an average price of $162.51, and we will say we purchase more stock earlier in the fiscal quarter. Now before I turn it back to Chrissie for Q&A, a quick update on e-commerce and our credit card relationship with Citi Visa. Worldwide, e-commerce sales for the first quarter of '18 were $1.3 billion, up 40% year-over-year. Again, somewhere between 5% and 10% benefit in the holiday shift. We continue to improve our offerings and we continue to improve our member experience with better sales, checkouts and returns processes. In the quarter, our site traffic conversion rates and traffic were up nicely year-over-year and we enjoyed basically stronger metrics for both the Thanksgiving, Black Friday week as well as Cyber Monday, which falls into Q2 this year versus -- falls in Q2 this year and last year. Warehouses are supporting costco.com with signage used in search and purchase, and people can purchase for dot com items via members warehouses, selected items. Online grocery, as you know, at the call fiscal quarter ago, we talked about that week in first week of October, we introduced two new delivery options at Costco.com; a dry grocery two-day delivery and our same-day fresh -- the latter -- and also same-day fresh delivery through Instacart. Both of those rolled out early October. They've been positive to date while still in the soft openings/limited marketing mode. We rolled out in Q1 '18. We added -- enhanced the value excited membership. Q1 '18, we have now members who are Executive Members purchasing from Costco travel who also received a 2% reward on all their travel purchases. And of course, with travel and the like on -- using their Citi Visa card, they get an additional 3%, so 5% between the 2. We're also now offering a buy online, pickup in store in selected items, including jewelry and some laptop computers. We're seeing proper coming into pick them up and over half of them were shopping while they're there. Overall, all these efforts are having a positive impact on our business, both online and in the warehouse, and it results in greater sales momentum that increased awareness of our digital presence. As well as we've done quite a few things online to increase traffic in our warehouses. I think I shared a few of those with you the last time, whether it's hot price on USDA choice prime steak to the back-to-school Labor Day weekend. And so we think that we can use the Internet and online and e-mails to drive traffic both ways. In terms of Citi Visa Anywhere card; when the conversion to Citi Visa occurred back in June of '16, there were 11.4 million co-branded cards or 7.4 million accounts. Those were transferred over to Citi for the conversion. As of Q1 end, we now have 2.1 million new approved member accounts or 2.8 million new cards of there. And that includes about 263,000 new accounts opened during the 12-week first quarter. We continue to be pleased with the adoption utilization of the card to date and it's been overall very good for us and our partners. Lastly, our fiscal '18 second quarter scheduled earnings release date for the 12-week second quarter ending February 18, this again will be after the market close on Wednesday, March 7. However, earnings call that afternoon at two P.M. so we'll release the earnings shortly after the market closes and at the top of the next hour do the call. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions with Christy. Back to you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael Lasser : Richard, are you now at -- is membership for club now at a growth level that can be sustained from here? And whether any unit promotions that contributed to the growth in that method that you experienced during the quarter? Richard Galanti : I think the biggest thing, if you go back a few quarters ago where it was that average came down a little bit, it's composed of two primary things, well, 3: Number of openings, and certainly they fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year; two, we have huge memberships sign-ups in certain new markets, particularly Australia, Asia, Iceland was off the charts, great, and so when those compared to in the U.S. and Canada where we have been forever; and so those time, as you may get. And then when we add new unit to an existing market, and I gave a couple of example of that last time, that will tend -- you know, we might have 65,000 members per warehouse in three locations in the east side of Seattle here or in the San Jose area; I think those are two examples I gave you. We opened up a new unit, which adds $120 million, $130 million of incremental sales, but only adds literally a few thousand additional members because you now have members that are shopping more frequently because we're closer to them; and so that will continue to happen. The timing of openings, as I've said, that will be up and down. I think overall, the number -- the metric did come up both last quarter and this quarter year-over-year for the first time and we're adding some new markets as well. That will help us. My guess is the average, if you take the total number of warehouse at quarter end and divided by the total number of locations, I mean, this is in the low 60s, it will probably remain plus or minus that a little bit. To the extent it was a little less, we'll look at it and say, well, usually the reason is there were less year-over-year openings in a few of these international markets. We feel very good about our renewal rates and so far so good on what we've felt the impact of the credit cards switch and the auto bill, and so, so far so good. Michael Lasser : In the past, you've given a little bit more detail on renewal rate by Gold Star Primary Business that was your cohort. Is there any reason why you decided not to give that detail? Richard Galanti : I think the biggest reason, over the years for some of you on this call noticed for 20 or 25 years doing this, and we've gotten so granular, it almost has become a distraction. Rest assured, anything that is impactful, we're going to make sure that you know about. But at the end of the day, what's important is total number of members and growth, existing renewal rates, of course. And part of the other challenges is for years, we've had -- early on in our career, wholesale member, you have to have a bona fide business license and truly was a small business owner. And then that evolved into a business mentorship where you have business add-ons, and many of those were not for business purposes but small business with 10 members, with 10 employees and the employer bought the membership for his or her employees. And then after that, with the Executive Membership coming on, those people would get off of that primary membership and have their own membership. So we know more about our business member versus not based on what they're buying than anything else. Michael Lasser : And then my follow-up question this on the potential for tax reform. Would you treat any savings that you might get from potential tax reform as any other windfall that you get and reinvest that back in the business in the form of price, lower prices? Richard Galanti : Well, first, we have to wait and see what actually happens. I know in the first year, what we're reading about today, there's still some onetime offset to that for earnings overseas, historical earning overseas to the extent of that cash hasn't come back. That will be a partial offset, I believe, to what we currently read today. Look, going forward, we're going to do what's long term right for our stockholder's quarter's valuation. And for us, that includes all of the things you've heard about historically. But we'll have to wait and see and talk about it more when you get there. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Charles Grom : Just on the gross margins, I think you said the quarter-on-quarter was flat. I was wondering if you could shed some color there on the Visa benefit? And then also what the total core was as a percentage of their own sales? If you could just amplify on any of the category color on direction that you gave earlier. Richard Galanti : Yes. Getting back to the previous person's question about why respond with a granularity, the big benefits were in the first year. There was some incremental benefit, but going forward, we're really not going to specify the detail. Needless to say, incrementally, it was a lot lower than going from nothing to the big benefit that we got in the first 12 months and that we'll continue to get and the good news is it's growing us percent of sales. In terms of core encore, I think it was down few basis points. I don't have that detail in front of me. And again, I know that was a big question last -- I was about to say last semester, last quarter, compared to prior quarters. There's so many moving parts. What I can tell you is we feel very good about our margins. There are a lot of the stuff that we have done and we'll continue to is offensive and not defensive and we are probably the biggest prize that's worth as good if not better than we thought it was going to work. Charles Grom : Okay, great. And then just any early readings with Instacart? I know when you did Google Express that most of the purchases were falling trips and were therefore complimentary. I was just curious what your early takes are with that effort. Richard Galanti : Look, all the members are great partly because they expanded themselves in terms of the number of locations over the last 12 months. Two, its front and center now on our website. But one of the things I mentioned here, we both have chosen for the first two-three months for this thing to basically have a soft opening, if you will, to make sure that we don't screw it up. And when I say we don't screw it up, it's growing very nicely. But clearly, when we market it, we think it will take off even more. But so far, so good. Charles Grom : Okay. So then when you look at the acceleration in digital sales in November, that was really just your core Costco.com business? Richard Galanti : Yes. Operator : Next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. John Heinbockel : The thought of starting with jewelry and PCs, what sort of drove that? How far can you take that operationally? Right, if you think about other products like big bulky stuff, papers and beverage, can you do that operationally? And then is that what your customers want? Are you hearing from numbers that they want more bulk items? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, we haven't heard from a lot of members. I'm not so sure that -- we have not asked them either, by the way, but we do see the strength in our numbers particularly in store. I mean, the online is fantastic, but in-store is maybe 5% of our business. When we look at doing it our way, we still scratch our head about doing what -- even consider doing what some of the others are doing, not just other warehouse clubs, but other retailers. There's a lot of cost to that. So far, we haven't seen a reason to do that. In the case of these couple of categories, what we found is that there are people that won't buy it because they don't want -- they can't have it shipped to their office or their place of work and they don't want it left at their doorstep. And so here's a way for them to buy it and we saw a nice piece of business being done that way. And as you might expect, since we're not going to be over to pick up the groceries that we bought and put for the refrigerated stuff in the refrigerator and the frozen stuff in the freezer, they just go up to the cage and get this. Over half of them went in at shopped before they pick up their laptop or their jewelry. So that's what we like and we'll keep evolving it and we'll see, it's just the start. John Heinbockel : And then the -- when you think about tenure of openings here, right, so do you think we are more at the low end of that 20 to 25? And obviously we have sort of haven't done many in Asia of late. Is that just the way the real estate timing folds and we're going to get a surge in overseas openings on the next 18 months? And then I think you're doing just one business center this year, is that right? Richard Galanti : Only one business center this year? Unidentified Company Representative : We've already opened up San Francisco, so we have one at Minnesota, maybe... Richard Galanti : We'll have at least two this year, having open one already and maybe a third. That's just a matter of timing. I think it's clearly in the list right after the fiscal year. A lot of that has to do with timing. In terms of the 20 to 25, history would suggest we are at the lower end versus the higher end. There were a couple -- and the real difference is that things that don't have on the plate already, it's -- can we push them, can we move, do we get lucky with the weather if we push a couple of days on different hurdles like with permits or whatever. John Heinbockel : And then just lastly, are you also -- you talked about the gas benefit. Was that de minimis or how big was that? Richard Galanti : Well, we're trying to -- there's no good time to get a less granular, but when you add them all up, it was the biggest line to the bottom line but at the end of the day, gas is good, there have been some quarters. If you looked at the last 8 or 12 quarters which I haven't looked at, it's probably more than a $0.01 and there have been quarters when it was $0.05; and it could be anything whether there or little on either side of that. Needless to say, they were good. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Karen Short : First, just a housekeeping question. What was inflation in the quarter? Could you give that? Richard Galanti : No, we didn't. Overall, ex-gas and maybe the best was up a couple of percentage points. We don't really look at LIFO anymore. We had it, but we don't look at it. Our guests -- I think, if there was anything that's maybe ex-gas, there was a tiny amount of inflation. But that was on the cost side. Investing on price and given the competition that you see from other retailers out there, my guess is there is probably little if any inflation. Karen Short : Okay, so that was [indiscernible], it's done a lot of -- I mean, PPI has clearly been high, I mean up and elevated, while TTI has been a lot more muted. So I guess, that's -- I'm wondering how much that impacted your margins? Or how do we think about that in terms of\u2026 Richard Galanti : I really don't think that impacted it, Karen. It's really us looking at what happens when we get hot on pricing or hotter and recognizing we have these benefits from credit card and from membership. And that's what we do. Karen Short : Okay. And then I guess, in terms of grocery delivery and then Instacart, I guess, you didn't give an update. Are you still at the 500 SKUs for grocery delivery and 1.700 on Instacart? And then anything to indicate on that component of the business, whether or not this is drawing a customer who has kind of been dormant? Now you're seeing incremental trips; anything it could point to because obviously the concern is that there will be cannibalization with this offering. Richard Galanti : We really haven't. I mean, it's still -- even though they are big increases in what they're doing today before the day after with us going back to in early October, it was miniscule relative to our company size. We'll wait six months and then take a look at it. Karen Short : Okay. And then lastly, how many units on focus right now? Richard Galanti : I'm sorry, how many units? Karen Short : Are on the buy online, pick up in store for those smaller items? Richard Galanti : Very limited. Hold on, hold on. All warehouses are doing jewelry and laptops in U.S. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Richard, first on membership, could you talk about how successful the couple of promotions that you ran in the quarter and how it performed relative to other ones you've done in the past? And just generally, is the environment -- the competitive environment for club membership any different than it's been in the past? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, I'm not sure what we did this first quarter. During Q4, we did the Groupon/mini social. That went fine but I'm not sure of anything we did this quarter. Simeon Gutman : Okay, what about the environment? Is it any different as far as competitors being promotional for new members? Is there anything to call out versus what it was like in the past? Richard Galanti : I don't think they're more promotional, but our direct competitors have been very promotional one more than the other. But whether it's a monthly one or a certain amount of dollars off to try it out, and so we haven't really seen any dramatic differences to that. It's been that way for a while. Simeon Gutman : Okay. My follow-up is on the online sale. You gave it a bit of color, I don't know if you talked about categories that are out comping the house average. Are there any gross margin implication of the categories? I realize there is still a range even within a pretty tight band, but curious, just thinking about the products that are growing faster than the house online versus others, if that's doing anything for the gross margin? Richard Galanti : Well, yes. But keep in mind, with all these wonderful growth, it is still very smart -- it's less than 5% of our company so it doesn't have that big impact to the overall company. Electronics, it probably does because we've been very successful online with electronics. And given the white club service, hopefully, members understanding that if they are an executive member and may have the flow brand card, they'll get an extra 5% off and they get a four-year warranty that includes using the co-brand card. So all those things will help drive the business notwithstanding we have to let everybody know. And I think apparel has been good, but part of that so that we are doing more apparel online. And I think we're also getting better with a small B on targeting certain types of e-mails to members to do some of these things. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Dan Binder from Jeffrey's. Daniel Binder : So first question was on the Visa cardholder. I was just curious, you're over a year and now. Do you have any comparative data on how that cardholder spending in the club versus the MX holder previously? Richard Galanti : The only thing I'd look at -- I don't know that. The only thing -- in many cases, it is the same number. We believe you have a higher spend because of a better rewards, better promotions. The fact that Visa is accepted in more places, if it is your top of wallet, old reward card, co-branded card, it was my top of wallet and now the new Citi Visa is. There are many more places I can use my new one, and so that's driven more outside spend. And the beauty of co-branded programs with big companies, whether it's airline, retail, hotel, travel, is that there's some revenue share there. So those are the metrics we look at. We also, of course, double the reward on Costco purchases, gas more, not a double, but everything else used to be one and now it's two. So all of those things are helping us trend in the right direction there. Daniel Binder : And then with regard to renewal rates, you highlighted of the renewal rate was same as where we were at the end of the fourth quarter. I know last quarter, you're talking about the trajectory and how you think it will follow your experience in Canada. Do think that next quarter, we could see the first tick up in renewal rates? Richard Galanti : I think a quarter ago, we said one or two quarters. And so we have one more quarter of flat to -- we're talking about tenths of a percentage point, half a tenth is what we'll average it up or down. We want to hedge our bets here a little bit. But we believe this in the case, but we've got one more quarter of free pass here but we were pleased with what we saw in Q1 compared to Q4 end. Daniel Binder : And then lastly, do you have any numbers around membership growth in comp stores? Richard Galanti : No, we don't. Only because we did that last quarter because we know there was a lot of concerns around it, we thought that was a data point. And I'm sorry, we just don't have that. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Christopher Horvers : So on the core margin being flat ex-gas, usually when you're going to these periods of intimate piece of the renewal, the membership fee increase. It tension investing gross margin and I think most expected it to be down. So going back to a prior question, is mix helping you? The price environment is pretty promotional out there solid just trying to understand why that came in flat versus through the historical experience of how you would invest and to the fee increase period. Richard Galanti : Look, our philosophy is we invest in this stuff. We are also pragmatic. There's a lot out there, but I think we have a benefit also. We could take -- given our limited nature, limited number of items, we could just do some hot buys on a limited number of items that are truly wow, and drive sales and item at extra $10 million or $20 million in a week or a few weeks. And so it seems to work for us, we feel good that we've got -- we're looking at this stuff offensively and we'll see how we use it. Christopher Horvers : And then in terms of the following up on the tax question, you talked about doing what's right for the shareholders, the valuation of the stock, and historically, I think your motto is customer employee vendor shareholder. So is that the way how we should think about that potential tax flow through? Richard Galanti : We got crazy a little bit, sure, I mean, yes, we're going to keep doing what's right. And again, I'm noting try to be cute. First of all, we don't know what the tax plan is going to do and we don't know the impact on first year of it based on some offsets. But you can rest assure that we'll do the right thing and we'll drive the business the way we do it that helps of those stakeholders. Christopher Horvers : And then lastly, just a couple of quick follow-ups. This in the calendar, this the 53rd-week end up being a point on headwind for this upcoming quarter? And the other line, we think, gross margins, I think you said 26 basis points. When you say some of that is going to stick around for the next three quarters, is that 26 basis points or something like that? Richard Galanti : No, no. Within the 26 is 19 of that 26 was that $51 million legal settlement benefit to gross margin in Q1 of '17 a year ago. So year-over-year was minus 19 basis points. So we're talking about is the other 7, and the other seven has primary do with a major switch we did and how we hand over, return and dispose of salvaged merchandise. And we tested it for a couple of years in one of two regions, one region than another. And then just the last six or seven months we rolled it out through the United States to selling all 12 depots that do this for us that can handle the entire United States. And needless to say, we did because it works, since it's positive. There's the start-up cost if you will of getting it rolled out and done in the efficiencies that we look for overtime. That seven hopefully will be 6, 5, 4, 3; but a year from now it will be zero in theory and then go the other way a little bit. But at the end of the day, we wanted to point it out because it is a little unusual and we recognize that you guys are very sensitive to these basis points of margin. Christopher Horvers : And then 1.5 point sale shift? Richard Galanti : That's for Q2. Christopher Horvers : That is a headwind? Richard Galanti : Yes, that will be a headwind, yes. And it will be a bigger headwind for e-commerce because we don't know if it's 5% or 10% probably in the high singles; that's a guess. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : Can I just ask about traffic; it wasn't that long ago, I guess, that traffic slipped to kind of 2% or so and we were also thinking maybe this is the new norm. Obviously, you have seen dramatically better traffic growth this year. I guess, like just thinking about things in hindsight, was there something unusual about that period of 2016? And then as we think about things going forward, is there anything really that would cause things to set to that kind of level again given the levers you now have to pull in this business, whether it's the fee increase or tax or whatever it might be? Richard Galanti : I think a little of it has to do with credit cards switch leading up to June of '16 for about nine months, prior from June 16 backwards. We didn't sign up any new members, but we had American Express agreed, there's no sense signing up selling for a card that's going to go away in June of 2016. And so there's probably some negative impact and confusion, and the confusion probably into the first few weeks of the new card given it was a overnight transition which was faded in behind. And -- so I think that probably had -- it certainly wasn't a positive impact, my guess is it was a little bit of a smaller impact. I think, it's -- I remember when those numbers were coming down, we were asked, and like you just said, we said maybe it's just normal, we don't know; we felt good about our business and one of the things we did is how should we get it more excited out there and part of that was the pricing and the like. So I -- we also had a little bit of hiccup from a traffic standpoint with the multi-vendor mailers. If you recall, the good thing is it's pure items with greater values and more sales than an MBM. However, the offset to that was we probably dug a little bit deeper than we should have in terms of fewer MVM days and during the course of the year. And we saw that impact basically December of '16 to February or March of '17, so pretty much Q2 of fiscal '17. And then as we said on that Q2 call, which was a disappointing quarter, we said it's easy, we'll change it back, we'll add some more days. We kept the lower fewer items and the greater values and that's working nicely, but we have more days and so we had less and where we had tweaked a little bit too much, we've had fewer MVM days or higher traffic helping days. We were back to pretty much normal in that, maybe a few less, but nothing that really impacts us. Edward Kelly : Just a follow-up on tax format. I know it is a difficult question to ask, but maybe we think about it in like bigger picture sense of investment and how you think about driving sales. And as you think about sort of like where you'd like to spend money particularly if you were to potentially get some windfall, everyone sort of thinks about price, but are there other things that sort of like would really like to have but are expensive? Or an earnings headwind currently that makes the return calculation a little different, whether it's the enhanced digital or fulfillment or something on labor. Just figure out, are there other areas of business besides just price you should be thinking about that you would like to invest if you had the opportunity? Richard Galanti : First of all, I would like to think we would be doing those anyway. We have strong cash flow. As you know, we generate cash flow well in excess of our CapEx and keep increasing the regular dividend, have done the specials a few times and brought back stuff to at least cover more than, frankly, cover that, which over 5,000 employees get as part of the compensation. And so I'd like to think that -- I don't think we're going to sit around the table and say we have this big box of money and what would we do we are not prepared to do yesterday. I know -- now as we said, I think you'll see us do what we do well. It's merchandising and driving business and taking care of our employees and also taking care of our shareholders. I'm not trying to be cute. We don't know what we're going to do yet because we first we have to figure out what can actually happen. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Couple of follow-ups; one on the calendar shift, can you talk about whether it was a particularly profitable 1.5 of sales? Clearly, you're going to do a lot more sales per day and probably per employee hour. I'm not sure what the margin profile that you generate on that week so any impact on operating margin rate from that shift and presumably whatever it was would reverse in the following quarter. Richard Galanti : This is -- I'm shooting from the hip on this one. Look, having extra strong sales in a warehouse on that day, they are more profitable as a percentage of pretax because you already budgeted your labor and is busier. We kind of know on the other end, hopefully we budget properly there so maybe it won't dramatically offset. But I don't -- We're talking about a few weeks here and there, I don't think it is a big deal either way. Matthew Fassler : Okay. And then another question, you asked on e-commerce about profitability related to category shift. If you think about the growth of the business, you think about some of the accommodations you're making and the incremental offers that you are providing, can you talk a bit about the gross margin profile of e-commerce in total? I think you addressed them briefly, I think, as part of the gross margin discussion. Any sense as to the direction and they also know it's small, you made that point as well. Just as it gets bigger, is the direction you're taking it in and moving to gross margin category with the other through that channel, just, is what I should say? Richard Galanti : First of all, gross margins in e-commerce even two years ago was a little lower than the warehouse, but yesterday was a lot lower than warehouse. So the bottom line was a lot higher than the warehouse, recognizing it wouldn't exist if it's in another warehouse. So it's all one big happy family there. At the end of the day, what we have found and what everybody else found before us probably is if we can figure out and we have, we think, figure out how to communicate effectively with our members on some particularly hot buys, it really drives business, and not just online. And so I think there is enough -- we have so much, in my view, flexibility and comfort in our margin. And because we're not being -- our views is our margin, whether it's a basis point lower or basis point higher is because of what we wanted to do, not because we're impacted by losing something to someone else. I think we're fortunate in that regard. And even with very competitive products, hydraulics is very competitive, we over-indexed to higher end stuff. It's all competitive everywhere, but within the electronics here, it is probably a little better, a little less competitive, which makes us look better. So there's so many -- we have, in my view, there's so many buckets we can pull from. I don't see that as a big thing to worry about analyzing the structure. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Just to follow-up on the e-commerce conversation. You had a series of announcements on the last few calls, including partnerships in the buy online, pick up on store Costco grocery. I just want to take a step back real quick, Richard, and if you could just talk overall kind of your mindset and approach to e-commerce and kind of omnichannel and what's kind of led to -- I think, a lot of us view this as a bit of a term in the narrative in the way that you all have kind of approached the business historically. Richard Galanti : I think we still done things our way and we continue to evolve. Needless to say, there's a lot of views out there, like several people on the phone here, and there's a range of views. I think what we've hopefully communicated is that in our own way, there's lots of little buckets out there and low-hanging fruit that we haven't touched. Perhaps we should've touched some of them earlier, who knows. But we seem to be running on many cylinders here and the things we're doing our work in. Importantly, not only through e-commerce or omnichannel, but for in-store and driving business that way as well. We feel fortunate in that regard. It was funny, I remember on the last earnings call three months ago when we talked for the first time about the two new delivery options on grocery, on Costco.com site, these two links. And on the one hand, there's some out there that viewed this, yes, they cleared it out. There's others saying they had to do this because somebody else is wrong. Our view is we are kind of doing it pretty well first and foremost with driving our brick-and-mortar business, understanding that some of it was going to evolve in respect of this. We believe we were very successful with big-ticket items, furniture, big-ticket like electronics. What was evolving already 10 years ago online even with us was light club service on things you had to install or build like a patio set or swing set or a big thing television. One of the things we talked about last quarter was white goods. Over the last several months, we've improved our direct relationships with LG and Samsung rather than trying to -- rather historically when we were doing white goods not terribly well with just a little bit of a couple of item, not with the highest end stuff that we could sell in store. All of a sudden, we have great value, incredible value plus extra award, all that stuff if you use your Visa card. And we think we can take an item that was well under $100 million sales in a matter of few years be $1 billion. Now $1 billion is still just under a percent of sales, but it's $1 billion. There is a lot of things we're able to do in this tough new world. I'd mentioned before apparel, where brick-and-mortar apparel is flat or down. And total apparel, including online, is up a few percentage points. We've got worldwide $7 billion -- close to $7 billion apparel business that's compounded in the last three-plus years over 9%. Two reasons, growth in signature and weakness in brick-and-mortar, and some manufacturer willing to sell to us for the first time, so suppliers. And amazing pricing; so we'll keep doing that. Paul Trussell : That makes sense. And also in looking at your strong top line over the last few months, it's occurred globally. You spoke a bit about kind of the investments in price on some of the product on the U.S. front. Is that the same story in what's happening in Canada and other places around the world? Or other any kind of unique factors that we would attribute some of these in those regions, too? Richard Galanti : It's everywhere. The fact that the warehouse club concept is newer in some of those countries, the fact that we're opening more new units, we opened one unit in Sylvia, it's in Seville, Spain. Smaller market than Madrid, but you had vendors, even international vendors and certainly local vendors, that would not -- were a little crazy, they knew how big we are, and if we comment, it would be great; but they have a lot of customers that weren't drilled. Once we get that second one opened, it helps in the first one as well. We see the same thing happen in Australia in the first few years and again it gets back to we are in sourcing and global supply company. And clearly, with eight or so locations in Australia, we bring the purchasing power of $130 billion retailer to that market and that helps us as well. And I think the fact that our first signature items have become a high end, and incredibly low priced brand, incredibly high-value brand, that helps us as well. Paul Trussell : And lastly, for me quickly, I might have missed it, but from the Visa card, did you outline any particular benefit to gross margins or SG&A in this quarter? Richard Galanti : Well, for the first four quarters since it was so large going from the prior program to what this great new program has done for us, we did. And going forward, we aren't. We did say that incrementally, it was a little benefit percentage-wise. Operator : Next questions comes from the line of Kelly Bania of BMO. Kelly Bania : Just curious on the SG&A line, you mentioned some incremental cost to think about over the next few quarters. Can you quantify that at all for us? And in terms of the shift, was there an impact, the calendar shift, to SG&A or membership or any other line items in the quarter? Richard Galanti : There's about little things. I mean, first of all, in terms of the shift, to help you -- as Matt asked early about the extra percentage half, it helps a little bit, but it's hard to quantify. This a little bit of shift with some holiday pay issues, but you're talking about, my guess is a small amount of basis points. The thing is the first part of the question you asked was about this thing and it will continue for the next few quarters; that's a margin item. That had to do with us changing the way to make it, frankly, more efficient and less costly for handling returns. And doing it centrally, if you will, at each of 12 depots across the country in the United States. Talking about U.S., we started -- we tested this for the first time probably three years ago; and over the last six months we went from two to 12 depots, added 10 of them. And so there was about -- that was much of that extra, that line item that was 26 basis points of which 19 was the one-time thing from last year. Those other seven basis points, much of that is that, but that's a margin hit; and so that will be a little bit of a margin hit in the upcoming, probably two or three quarters. I'm hoping it will dwindle a little bit, but that would be what it will be. Kelly Bania : Great. And then just on online with the acceleration online of grocery, just curious if you have any -- based on what you've seen so far, it's been very successful with just even a soft launch. So you mentioned getting deeper into using some e-mail and some targeted e-mail. Just curious, what else can we expect to come from online? Do you have any plans for adding an auto replenishment feature? Anything you can share with us on that would be great. Richard Galanti : First of all, with regard to like -- delivery, we have done no marketing effort per say, so it truly has been a soft opening, both on our part and in the case of same-day grocery, on Instacart's part, we want to get it right. Percentage-wise, it's going crazy but it's very small, small amount of business relative to our company. Well, even with the comments I made about the laptops and the jewelry, that's the test. We looked at it and of course, we've been asked a hundred times, what about order online pick-up in store, we scratched our head in recognizing our places are a lot busier than others. We don't see how that makes sense and we don't hear a lot of members asking about it but we look at it and said where are some areas where it makes some sense and so we're trying. Tires that make sense and that's been very successful over the last year, year and a half where you can order the tires online to go to the location that you want them installed at, your traditional warehouse that you shop at; and that's driven -- in our view, that's driven volume to the tire business for us. Kelly Bania : Any from the auto replenishment? Richard Galanti : No comment at this point. We'll let you know if and when we decide. We're looking at that and some other things. Operator : Next question comes from the line of David Schick [ph] from Consumer Edge. Unidentified Analyst : We talked a lot about digital and what you're trying digitally. My question is what you're seeing digitally in e-commerce, is that causing any merchandising decisions, pushed anything back to the club? Are you noticing anything in those trends that could change your merchandising? Thank you. Richard Galanti : Yes, I mean, one thing that we've done is we've done a better job of e-mailing people to get them into the warehouse; I mentioned the New York strip steaks [ph]. We've also done some items that -- if you bought in-store a baby seat, car seat, the banner that's at the top of your e-mail includes some hot items or if you bought tires, the banner includes some automotive or garage items. Some of those are online and some of them are in-store; the tires, I just mentioned. And in terms of -- right now, what we're doing is high-fiving each other, it's working to drive business in-store and drive business online. Unidentified Analyst : Just -- any update on the wage outlook, you guys have stayed ahead of it and been very transparent with it. But just talking about the wage outlook now, 90 days since your last quarter. Richard Galanti : No, we feel good about that. We've taken -- of course, we took up wages throughout using the U.S. as a base here. We took about year and a half ago, March of '16 and in several markets we started people a little higher than that where we have to. Some parts of the Bay Area, some parts of New York, and there are only a couple of cities, Seattle and San Francisco, where there's a minimum of 15, but rest assured we'll stay ahead of the game a little bit. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : So a couple housekeeping items and then a question. I don't think we've talked about much about inflation, or if we did, I missed it, and I wonder what the inflation would look like in the quarter, what's your outlook? Richard Galanti : Yes, we did talk briefly about it. Look, we think it's up a little, but it's muted by the fact that driving better value. And so really not a big issue either way. Next question. Scott Mushkin : The cost of hurricanes, that's the other -- there was a cost, I didn't hear what you said what the cost was. Richard Galanti : We try to be a little less granular because if there are some offsetting things of there. The two together were a couple of $0.03 in total, but that's the difference. I'm learning not to tell you stuff. Scott Mushkin : My last -- my real question is, when you take a step back and we talked about e-commerce forever, the Amazon impact that concerns about it, you historically, said we want people in our stores, we don't believe in a lot of this stuff, particularly the buy online and the Quicken collect types of businesses. The -- you want people in your stores or your warehouses. I guess, just from a philosophical perspective since your sales are so darn strong, why are you guys moving aggressively with some of the e-commerce, these e-commerce trials or you're just rolling it out? It seems that if I look at it over time, it could be harmful to keeping people in your warehouses. And I just wanted to know philosophically what made you guys changed your mind and why you're doing it? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, I think, well, we want to be responsive and we want to make sure that we're not being stubborn about things but we also want to do it our way. I think we've gotten comfortable, there are some things we can do that we think can drive our total company sales and profitability without impacting and also recognize that if we have 3,800 -- an average about 3,800 items in-store, maybe we have twice that online, this is a rounding year for everybody else in terms of what they offer to customers in terms of items. And so we have to see or how to do it and still have the value of what we do. And so I think -- we've also figured out how to do it without spending hundreds of millions of dollars. We are -- the two-day drive grocery -- up to two-day drive grocery that we're doing to a handful of our depots which covers essentially the entire United States, we're able to do that pretty cheaply because we are already allowing business members to run the business and not depots but the business centers, because you can already buy it online and have it delivered. But we brought in about -- just under 500 items that were more retail consumable type items. So our view is these are relatively inexpensive ways to try things and they're working, we do have to kind of first -- we have to measure how we do going forward if we love for orders -- on grocery orders online to be filled in, not stop you from coming; we've recognized it you may come a few less times during the year. How do we change that? And we also recognized there is people that live 30 to 60 minutes away from us, sometimes that's 10 miles, sometimes that's 40 miles and that's been a big move for us where we see this could help. So again, life has changed on big-ticket, big sized items and items that you've got to install, and in many cases items that you want somebody else to take the old mattress or the old refrigerator away. So we can show -- we've got nothing, some confidence in those areas that we can show the best value on the high-end stuff in those areas as well. So I think it's all working probably a little better than we thought it would. Scott Mushkin : Alright, I appreciate the answer and I'd give a shot out to that tire program, it's actually -- it's pretty good. Anyway, have a good holiday. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky : I just wanted to see if you could take sort of a 30,000-foot view and talk about how the mix is different and changing as these economies improve, not only in the U.S. but maybe also on Canada and the rest of your operations? Richard Galanti : Bigger ticket items, jewelry I think, has improved. Electronics, expanded electronics, not just computers or laptops or iPads, tablets and televisions but the whole audio side. Audio is everything from these boxes that you put outside, telephones and jewelry. So I think from a -- is the economy getting better? Who knows; certainly, there is money out there to be spent on the stuff and we have seen some pickup in those areas, and the Internet helped out a little bit. Charles Cerankosky : By Internet, you mean e-commerce? Richard Galanti : Yes. Charles Cerankosky : Great, thank you. Richard Galanti : Well, thank you, everyone, and we'll be around. Happy holidays. Operator : Thank you for your participation. That concludes today's conference call. You all may now disconnect.",

Baird Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Christy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Quarter Two Earnings Call and February Sales. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there'll be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over to CFO, Mr. Richard Galanti. You may begin. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Christy. Good afternoon to everyone. I'll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the 12 weeks ended February 18th, as well as February retail sales for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, March 4th. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $701 million or $1.59 a share, a 36% increase compared to last year's second quarter results of $515 million or $1.17 a share. This year's earnings per share included $0.17 due to a net income tax benefit of $74 million as a result of the tax legislation recently passed by Congress. Excluding this benefit, net income grew by 22% year-over-year. This afternoon, I'll start by reviewing our Q2 operating results. Beginning with sales, net sales for the quarter came in at $32.3 billion, a 10.8% increase over the $29.1 billion of sales during the second quarter of last fiscal year. This year's 12 week second quarter included one additional sales day in the United States versus last year due to the shift of Thanksgiving. But while we gained the sales day in the quarter, our pre-Thanksgiving and Black Friday holiday weekend sales fell in the first quarter this year compared to the second quarter last year. Combined these two factors negatively impacted second quarter sales results by an estimated 1.4% in the U.S. and slightly less worldwide, somewhere at or about 1%, 1.1%. The shift also negatively impacted ecommerce sales results by an estimated minus 7 to minus 8 percentage points in the second quarter. Recall that in Q1 we had an estimated 10% improvement relative to the shift in ecommerce. I think if you look at the 24 week fiscal year-to-date comparable sales results in our earnings release, it essentially eliminates the impact from the holiday shift altogether. Now for the second quarter 12 week comparable sales results, in the U.S. we reported a 7.1% increase ex-gas and FX, 5.7%, and then we\u2019d estimate these add to 1.4 back for the switch in the holiday. Canada 8.7% reported and 2.5% ex-gas and FX, other international reported 15.7%, 7.4% ex-gas and FX. So total company would be an 8.4% reported and 5.4% ex-gas and FX, a little over 1% of impact -- negative impact on that 5.4% from the Thanksgiving shift. E-commerce reported was 28.5% comp sales, 27.3% ex-gas and FX, and again we estimate that 27.3% was hit by about 7 to 8 percentage points related to the holiday shift, so something little over 30 ex-that. In terms of Q2 sales metrics, second quarter traffic or shopping frequency was up 3.7% worldwide and 3.4% in the U.S. Also, these numbers are negatively impacted by the Thanksgiving holiday shift as I just discussed. In terms of the impact on FX and gas for the company FX assuming flat currency relative to the U.S. dollar over the last year, that impacted sales, the strengthening in foreign currencies impacted sales by approximately 180 basis points positive, and gas inflation contributed another 125 basis points, so together about 3 percentage points. Cannibalization weighted on the comp to the tune of 55 basis points to the negative. Our average front end transaction or ticket was up 4.6% in the quarter, excluding the net benefits from gas inflations and strong foreign currencies relative to the dollar it was up a little over 1.5%. Our February sales results were also reported in sales release. I'll review these results at the end of the call. Moving down the income statement for the second quarter, there is membership income is the next line item. I reported in Q2 $716 million, up $80 million from the $636 million last year second quarter and up about 4 basis points or 12.6% in dollars. Now FX, the benefit of strong foreign currencies benefit the number by about $12 million. Of the $80 million increase in membership fees increased year-over-year about $37 million related to membership fee increases. The majority of the $37 million came from fee increases taken last year in first U.S. and Canada with the smaller balances from the fee increases taken in our other international operations starting back in September of 2016. So all told, if you take out both of those, we would on a normalize basis membership fees were up $31 million or about 5%. In terms of renewal rates, our renewal rates improved in Q2 to 90.1% in the U.S. and Canada, up from 90% a quarter earlier and worldwide improved to 87.3% as of Q2 end, up 20% from the 87.2% at Q1 end. I think the most important thing here of course is the trends we\u2019ve seen with the conversion of the credit card over the last year and half in the U.S. and slightly overlapping that prior to that in Canada and happy to see that what we expected came through there and seen a slight improvement now. In terms of members in Q2 end. At Q2 end, we had 39.6 million Gold Star members, up from 39.3 million 12 weeks earlier. Primary business were 7.5 million both quarter end. Business add-ons, which was 3.2 million at Q1 end and at Q3 end was 3.3 million. So total member households 49.9 million at Q1 end, up to 50.4 million at Q1 end. Total cardholders at 92.2 million at the end of the quarter, up from 91.5 million 12 weeks earlier. During the quarter, we only had one opening. At Q2 end paid executive member were 18.8 million, an increase of about 46,000 from the second quarter end or about 4,000 a week. A little softer than it had been in recent quarters. When we look at the quarter ago, it started off quite a bit weaker and I\u2019m happy to say the last several weeks have been in the high-teens low-20s on average per week. Lastly, in terms of the portion of membership fee increases related to the recent fee increases, that year-over-year quarterly membership fee increase will continue to grow each fiscal quarter this year and into fiscal \u201919 given the deferred accounting treatment as to when it benefits our income statement. The year-over-year increase will peak in Q4 of this fiscal year. So the $37 million Q2 increase related to that will increase in Q3 and increase again in Q4 based on the P&L on deferred accounting. And so have again smaller increases but in the next couple of three quarters after that into \u201919. Going down the gross margin line, our reporting gross margin came in at 10.98% or 2 basis points lower year-over-year. On a reported basis that minus 2 basis points, it was actually plus 11 basis points excluding gas and FX. Within that I\u2019ll have you just jab down the two columns with the four, five members in each column first column would be as reported and the second column wihtout gas inflation. The core merchandise on a reported basis was year-over-year down 20 basis points, down 8 basis points without gas inflation. Ancillary businesses up 23 basis points in the quarter and up 25 ex-gas inflation. 2% reward plus 1 and zero in those two columns, and other minus 6 and minus 6 basis points. So all told, if you add up column one the reported year-over-year gross margin change was the minus 2 basis points and ex-gas inflation was plus 11. If we look at -- as I've done in the past, if you look at the core merchandize categories in relation to their own sales, even though again on ex-gas inflation basis, the core has contributed to the total company was minus 8. If you look at core categories on core sales, margins year-over-year in Q2 were higher by 14 basis points. Subcategories within core margins year-over-year in Q2, food sundries, hard lines and fresh foods were up, soft lines was down a little. Notwithstanding greater all of these improvements and notwithstanding greater values for our members as we continue to do it. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin up 23% basis points and 25 ex-gas inflation. Gas represented a little more than half of that improvement, it's both the combination of these higher sales penetration and improved margins within the business. With hearing aids, pharmacy, optical business centers and travel all showing higher year-over-year gross margins and that contributed to that number as well. 2% reward again essentially at gas. Lastly in other as was the case with the first quarter, we were incurring incremental cost related to the rollout of our new centralized returns facilities. And this will continue to impact us as I said last quarter and each in the next few quarters, likely a little less each quarter and it was a down a basis point this time from 7 to minus 6. And long term, we believe it's a big benefit to us. Moving to reported SG&A. Our SG&A percentage Q2-over-Q2 was lower or better by 21 basis points and better by 9 basis points plus 9 basis points ex-gas inflation coming in at the 10.02% of sales this year compared to 10.23% on a reported basis. And again the two columns reported and without gas inflation. The first line item would be operations plus 19 basis points and plus 8 basis points ex-gas inflation, central minus 1 basis points and minus 2 basis points, stock compensation plus 3 basis points at each column and then total, plus 21 basis points or lower better by 21 basis points on a reported basis, and ex-gas inflation better by 9 basis points. Not a whole lot of unusual items here. The core operations component again was better by ex-gas inflation, strong top-line sales we believe led the year-over-year improvement in payroll, benefits and other traditional expenses like utilities and maintenance. Central expense higher by couple of basis points ex-gas. We've got a lot going on. Stock compensation better year-over-year by 3 basis points again strong sales and usually that's the number that's most impacting Q1 when we do the big grant every year. Next on the income statement is preopening expenses. They were better or lower by $3 million in Q2 this year they were $12 million, last year $15 million. Now again, this year we only opened one new unit. Last year, we opened four. However, we also have quite a bit of preopening related to two big manufacturing plants that we -- one we just opened and one under construction. A new meat plant in the Midwest as well as our major new chicken plant in the Nebraska that's under construction. All told reporting operating income for Q2 came in at $1.16 billion, up $172 million or 20% higher year-over-year from last year's $844 million number. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense came in at plus $6 million -- at $6 million higher year-over-year that $37 million this year compared to $31 million a year ago, primarily a result of last year's debt offering. Interest income and other was better year-over-year by $11 million in the quarter. Actual interest income for the quarter was better year-over-year by $5 million also benefiting this line item is the year-over-year comparison was various FX items, mostly various FX items in the amount of positive $6 million. Overall, pretax earnings were higher by 22% or $177 million higher in Q2 coming in at $986 million this year compared to $809 million last year the same quarter. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the second quarter came in at 27.7% for the quarter compared to 35.6% last year. Of course, the lower tax rate for Q2 this year its results of tax law changes. The primary benefit was the result of the lowering in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Given that our fiscal -- we don\u2019t have a calendar year and it doesn\u2019t line with calendar year. You take the number of days in each in our fiscal year, which fall before or after December 31st. In our case, it's a blended U.S. federal rate 35% for 119 days of the fiscal year and 21% at the remaining 245 days of the fiscal year, again an average of 25.58%. The impact of that lower rate on Q2 pretax income was $52 million of the $72 million I just mentioned -- the $74 million I just mentioned. The other $22 million is basically two main things. One is a true up of Q2 -- of Q1 recognizing in Q1 we assumed we had no reason to assume this much lower federal income tax rate, so turning up for the first quarter so that were in tune for the whole year. The other piece is some positives and some offsets to that relating to various things that have come with the new tax legislation. Also the net impact of these items in Q2 was an additional $22 million benefit tax benefit. So total tax benefit in Q2 of $74 million. The $52 million what I\u2019ll call normalized to Q2 the $22 million related to turning up Q1 and other offsets that go along with the original change in tax laws. Going forward, we anticipate that the effective companywide rate for the balance of \u201818 in Q3 and Q4 will be probably in the 29.5% to 30% range and in fiscal \u201819 based on what we currently know and of course all that subject to change is approximately, we assume it will be approximately 28% plus or minus. As we know more and we\u2019ll share it with you. Overall, the reported net income was higher by 36%, coming in at $701 million in Q2 compared to the $515 million last year. Again up 22% ex the tax benefits I just spoke about. Before I leave the subject of tax law changes, a few comments as to what our plans are vis-\u00e0-vis the savings. Overall, one, we do not expect any major changes to our capital allocations plans. We\u2019re generally net positive cash flow operator notwithstanding CapEx and dividends and what have you. Number two, as many others have done, we will use some of these savings to benefit our employees, we\u2019re working on that and stay tuned. Number three, we\u2019ll invest some of the savings to drive to continue to drive greater value to our members. This will certainly include investing in price, as well as other activities. And number four, when asked and we have been, if any of these tax savings will fall to the bottom line, the answer is yes. Most importantly, indirectly by investing and driving value, we\u2019ve seen what that does and we know what that does and much of that investing in value and price comes back in greater earnings. And directly, perhaps a little but again stay tuned. A few others items of note, warehouse expansion. As I mentioned, we opened only one unit in Q2 that\u2019s top of five net to use in Q1. Our plans for the current quarter, which will end in mid-May is two more. And then Q4 is the big quarter, it\u2019s a 16-week quarter but we plan to open net 15 units, 18 openings including three. Assuming we got there, we had 23 net openings for the year and I guess it\u2019ll 22 or 23. A little better than I think, I mentioned a quarter ago, but somewhere in those low-20s. For all of \u201918 again, we expect to open something around 22 or 23 with three quarters of those in the next two quarters and most of it in the fourth quarter. As of Q2 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 108 million square feet. In terms of stock buybacks, in all of fiscal 2017, we expanded $473 million purchasing just under 3 million shares at an average price of just under $158. In the first quarter, we expanded as mentioned $190 million at an average price of about $162.5. And this quarter just ended we expanded an additional $59 million at an average price of 187.7 per share. For now for an update on ecommerce business. We currently operate ecommerce sites in U.S., Canada, UK and Mexico, Korea and Taiwan. Total ecommerce sales for the second quarter came in at $1.5 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Overall, our ecommerce sales increases continue at very strong levels. If you look back in Q1, ex-FX, it was positive 42.1% again there was a chunk in there that related to the benefit of the Thanksgiving holiday shift in Q2, 27.3% as I just mentioned ex-FX. Adding the first half together, again taking out the Thanksgiving shift there. First half all together was plus 33.7% and in February as you saw in the press release and I\u2019ll talk about February overall in a minute came in at 37%. So continued very strong sales growth momentum in these numbers. We continue to prove our offerings and we continue to be up by improved member experience with better search checkout and return to processes that I\u2019ve shared so that equity in the past. In the quarter, our site traffic and conversation rates and orders were up nicely year-over-year. Our warehouses are supporting costco.com with signage and tablets in the store. We now have that in the 195 U.S. buildings and that\u2019s used to help search and purchase costco.com items for members in the warehouses. We continue to capture more email addresses. In addition, our improved content is resulting an increase in our open rated emails again driving traffic both in store and online. If you go right now to costco.com, I think it talks about hot buys. And you\u2019ll see that some of them are in warehouse only as supplies last and we think that we\u2019ve got some excitement going here in terms of driving traffic both specifically in store using the Internet and emails as well as driving traffic online. A great example that is again you can look for yourself with these hot buys in the warehouse. Online grocery, both our dry grocery two day delivery and our same day fresh delivery food cart. As I mentioned the last quarter rolled down in early October has been quite positive year-to-date and growing. We\u2019re just starting to do some limited marketing instant cart now is in 441 of our U.S. warehouses and should be in most of the remainder our U.S. warehouses by calendar year end. We continue to improve the online merchandise and services offerings. Again with not only in general but hot buys. We\u2019ve improved our apparel offerings. We\u2019re doing better job of focusing and adding items that are complementary to our warehouse offerings. We\u2019re doing some great things with some big ticket seasonal items where we might be out of them given date or start them at a certain date in store, but online we get for greater availability of those. And then we're doing some other exciting things. Currently, there is over 100 high-end beauty items online. In Q1 '18, we added the 2% reward to all travel purchases through Costco Travel that\u2019s something we have not done in the past that's a few -- to our executive members, as well if you use your Costco Visa card, cobranded card, you get 3% that way, so it will be 5% off with what\u2019s already great values and see growth in Costco Travel. As I think I mentioned last time in the call, we're offering a very limited buy online pick up in store. These are really basically selected small sized big ticket items where many people aren't likely to want to leave them at their doorstep. So some jewelry, tablets and laptops and most recently handbags, all these things are driving shops in store. Over half the people that are doing this are shopping in store women there. But again, this is limited this is -- we'll continue to see how it works. All these efforts that I just mentioned are having a positive impacts on our business, both online and in warehouse. And that we believe it helps for the sales momentum and increased awareness of our digital presence, as well as the traffic that we've enjoyed recently in our warehouses. In sum, we're continuing to expand these activities. It's evolving and improving. And then drive our business both online and in store and certainly some of the tax savings will go towards driving that as well. Next, let me review the February results before we turn at March 4th. As reported in our release, net sales for the month came in at $10.21 billion, a 12.8% increase from the $9.05 billion last year. Lunar New Year and Chinese New Year that occurred in February this year as compared to January last year. We estimate that this positively impacted the other international February sales by about 4.5 percentage points and the total company February sales by a little more than 0.5 percentage point. For the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2018, we reported sales of -- we have now reported sales of $68.51 billion, 12% increase from $61.18 billion in the same number of weeks last year. I won\u2019t go through all the numbers that you see in the press release, but again on a four week basis, the reported 9% U.S. ex-gas effects will be 7.5%. The 8.4% reported for Canada will be a 3.2%. The 22.2% other international would still be a very strong 14.1%, and total company 10.5% reported comp ex-gas in effects 7.7% to positive. And as I mentioned, ecommerce ex-FX 37% compared to the reported 38.1%. In terms of regional merchandizing categories for February, general highlights from the month. U.S. regions were the strong results for the Southeast, Los Angeles and Midwest. Internationally in local currencies at Taiwan, Japan and Mexico, were the top of the list this month. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to dollar total company benefitted by about 150 basis points, again I think for the last quarter it was 180. Canada was helped by about 425 basis points, and while other internationals helped by about 800 basis points. The impact of cannibalization on the total company in February was about 60 basis points. And the impact on the U.S. was about 40. At Canada, where we did quite a few openings this year was about 140 basis points impact from that. Now very small impact on our international to the tune of 30 basis points. In terms of merchandise highlights, food, sundries, comp sales for the month were positive mid-to-high single digits. Departments with the strongest results were tobacco, liquor and candy. Hardlines were up low double digits better performing departments were majors, tires and health and beauty aids, HABA. Majors were up mid to high 20s led by appliances, computers and tablets. So very strong showing there both in-store and online. Softlines were up mid to high single digits, better performing departments included the domestics, jewelry and apparel. Fresh Foods was up in the high single digits, better performing departments were meat, bakery and deli. Within the ancillary businesses, gas also still helped by the cannibalization with gas, food court and optical had the best comp sales results in February. Gas prices were higher year-over-year and had a positive impact on our total reporting comps of about 135 basis points. Our comp traffic or frequency for February was up 5.2% worldwide and 4.8% in the U.S. So an improvement over Q2\u2019s frequency figures as well. For February, the average transaction was up 5.1% for the month, which includes the impacts both of FX gas as well as the shift to the Lunar Chinese New Year. I did want to make one other comment. As you know, we reported our earnings 45 minutes before the call and the first thing that comes out with some of the news releases very quickly and where we beat the number or we missed the number. When we look at first call and the 27 or so analysts that put numbers in there, it appears to us there were about 12 to 27 over the last month or so have adjusted their numbers, their estimates for some estimate of tax reform benefit. If you adjust based on what they were before that it looks like the first call number of 146 I believe comes down $0.04 or $0.05 by that. I am just mentioning that because there's -- this confusion out there and everybody as we report given this quarter of transition. Lastly, our fiscal \u201918 third quarter scheduled earnings release dates for the 12 week third quarter ending May 30, and we'll do the same thing it'll be an after market close on Thursday May 31st with the earnings call that afternoon at 2 o'clock Pacific Time. With that, I'll open it up for questions. Back to you, Kristie. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : First question, Richard, can you discuss what's happening with spend per member trend and it\u2019s clearly increasing ex-gas. But can you talk about if members are spending in existing categories or new ones and then I have a follow up to that. Richard Galanti : Well, it's a little of both. I think you also have to add in there that -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I'm willing to bet that I know our average price per item has come down. I mean, we've done a lot of driving greater value just on the MVMs alone, you're seeing significant savings. In some cases a small amount from us but more from our suppliers, because it drives more sales. And we're getting with 20% to 30% fewer items, more total sales and more gross margin dollars. So I would guess that -- now to the extent that we're doing things like, I\u2019ve given you examples overtime, like certain apparel items like women\u2019s athletic wear that's going from 0 to 100 million in the last few years. Certainly in the last year, year and a half we've seen a big improvement in white goods, with the advent of being supplied by all the majors. And I don't have exact numbers in front of me, but I'd be willing to guess while we'd had some of the prior first -- second quarter on annualized basis that\u2019s well over 250, 300 million a year and growing. So there\u2019s going to be a few of those things as well. It\u2019s mostly frequency when you look at it. Simeon Gutman : Can you share what percentage of your members are spending online with you and is there any change in how frequently they\u2019re visiting? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t have the exact numbers, it\u2019s still -- I\u2019m sure it\u2019s still a low number. I don\u2019t know frankly if somebody had it, if it\u2019s 10 or 20 or 25. I know that when I -- from last week\u2019s budget meeting, when we look at in terms of the number of -- the open rate of emails, it has gone up substantially. Part of that is what we\u2019re sending them. We\u2019re sending them some really high items that get their attention, including while supplies last in store on some of these items. And that get their interest. I know we\u2019re seeing a better connect rate and again I don\u2019t want to give you numbers that I don\u2019t know exactly, but all those things are going in the right direction. As they should given as I said before there is a lot of low hanging food there, because there is a lot of things we hadn\u2019t done in the past. Simeon Gutman : And my follow-up is just on the Visa Card, you\u2019re cycling the benefit I know we\u2019re not talking about the buckets anymore. But can you just tell us how your profit pool is performing versus your own expectations? Richard Galanti : As it relates to Citi Visa? Simeon Gutman : Exactly, yes. Richard Galanti : The first four quarters, because it was so sizeable we shared with you the effective basis points of improved SG&A and margin related to how -- compared to the prior deal. We\u2019re now in the first couple of quarters, three quarters after that. For the year, it will still be an improvement but relatively small improvement. And when we started -- at the beginning of the anniversary, the first anniversary, because when you started you\u2019ve got some extra money to drive things, those fall off. We\u2019re still getting new sign-ups, we\u2019re still getting new account, we\u2019re seeing people spend more on it, we\u2019re see people spend more outside on it, which again is part of the revenue share. So I would say we\u2019re still very pleased with it. My guess is it will continue to grow this year less than our sales growth total company. And then probably consistent with that in the future from this big benefit that we started with. Now by the way, we\u2019re using some of that as well. I mentioned the adding the executive membership. We did several things that were successful over the holidays where if on top of the fact already that if you have to Citi Visa Card, if you buy a television for example at Costco, you automatically get 90-day return policy and a two year warranty. If you purchase it with say Visa Card, not only you get another 2% off on that on top of the 2% if you\u2019re an executive member, but you get another two-year on your warranty, so you get four-year warranty. On top of all that, we used some of the bucket if you will to drive even greater values, which drove people in. Where there were examples I don\u2019t have them in front of me, but literally on a $1,200, $1,300 retail TV where we were already at great savings on top fiscal that, if you use your Citi Visa Card, you got $150 to $300 cash card depending on what TV and when it was. So we\u2019re clearly -- I think I mentioned last time what we see with these dollars wherever they\u2019re coming from, whether it\u2019s from that bucket from the membership fee income bucket, from tax reform bucket, you name it, there is lot of buckets right now. There is -- we believe that we can use those to drive sales in lots of ways that perhaps give us a little more octane that we would have thought. Operator : Next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel. John Heinbockel : So Richard, if I look at the 2019 new tax rate. Am I right that the tax benefit in aggregate is about $300 million, is that fair? Richard Galanti : Well, take the pretax and -- well we don't know exactly. But if you look at we've been running at about 35.5 and subtract about -- and not only say 20, it's around 7 percentage points. I don't know if it's 6.5 to 7.5. You've got U.S. which is there\u2019s broad brush strokes, 70% of our earnings, so that's decide to get the benefit. You have some offsets from that, clearly some of the benefits from deferred tax foreign tax credits some things go away and things like that. So net-net, all that included we estimate that it's going to be around to 28 plus or minus. John Heinbockel : It sounded -- you talked about the benefit to the bottom line being more indirect. So whatever that is, it sounds like the vast majority of whatever the savings is the plan is to reinvest that in some form. Is that fair? And you listed a bunch of buckets. Are they all of equal sizes? And you didn\u2019t mentioned e-commerce bucket. Is there one of those or is that blended into the other ones you talked about? Richard Galanti : Well, when I talked about buckets, I really talked about what are additional moneys that we've got to things we've done in the last couple of years or benefitted from during the last couple of years. Notably, credit card switch, membership fee increase and of late tax legislative changes. All those things allow us to do more of what we do. And so again, I'm not being cute, but we'll suddenly fall to bottom line, yes. We also take care of our employees. We're looking a lot of different things now. Whenever we do, it's going to be something that's permanent not a onetime bonus necessarily. And we're going to take care of things. And we're also -- what we have seen is many of the things we've done value wise have while maybe lower the gross margin or dollars per sale unit that we've seen increase gross margin dollars because we sale heck a lot more units. And some of the things we're seeing now and the benefit of doing a better job of getting unit, even open your email. Now I don't know if we\u2019ve gone from a D to C, or C to B or B to an A, but my guess is there is still some room for benefit there. And I think the big thing we want to communicate is we feel good about what we're doing and good about what's going on. But there is never a dull moment out there. John Heinbockel : You've talked about pushing value. How does anything new with regard to KS in terms of product development or your pricing versus national brands, how does that play into this? Richard Galanti : Well, I mean the one that I read about recently in the press was our new hazelnut spread, which is basically Nutella. I mean, it is literally flying off the shelf. It's a great value and it's a great quality. There is several -- in every budgeting and every board meeting we see a whole plenty of new items that we're getting ready to try and rollout, whether it's organic, shelf stable food items or apparel KS items and others cosmetics. We've got a couple of fragrance items out there under that we've tested and we're going to continue to drive. So it's lots of little things. John Heinbockel : And then just lastly, do you guys yet know or been able to calculate the benefits you get to U.S. comp from the Sam\u2019s closings. And have you started -- I imagine you've started to see that already, right. Richard Galanti : We started to see with after. The first week everybody rushes to get sale items on 20% or 30% off. It\u2019s small as we expected. We each have to do our own estimate, but we think we've got a little bit of sales out of it and a little bit of member signs up from it, and that\u2019s continuing. My guess is if the average Sam's Club in the U.S. as I understand is in the low 90s, people say the 63 they closed were less than that. When I spoke to Craig immediately about it, Head of Operation, their collective view was that we'll probably get 10% or 20% of it not 50% or 70% of it. I originally thought that was low. But we do recognize not all of them are immediately closed, many of them are but some of them aren't, some of it\u2019s not the same customers and we wouldn't necessarily get it overnight and some we will. But look it\u2019s -- with all the other buckets even a small bucket this is nice thing to have here. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers. Chris Horvers : I think a lot of investors trying to figure out the strength in e-commerce. And I know there's a lot going on in terms of what you're doing on check out and category extensions and so forth. But could you perhaps rank the benefits, whether it's -- where would you put appliances versus extending the IO versus some of the brands and versus the rollout of online grocery. Richard Galanti : The roll out of online grocery is a very small piece of it. As that\u2019s just started -- but it is driving traffic. I think the biggest things are awareness and cross marketing, doing more activities in store to let people know about what's online and a better job of getting people to open their emails. And that's come with the headline if you will, which is something that's really hot in store and there's also a lot. Again, if you go to the site lately take a look and again I think we are starting from a low base and a low metric given on what we haven\u2019t done in the past. And so you talk to our e-commerce people and our head of relative department heads of merchandising, or head of merchandising, they feel pretty good that this will continue. I'm not suggesting 40 on 40 on 40 every year. But even when they hit 30 for the first time, Bob Nelson and I are asking well what happens a year from now, the view is there's a lot of things they got going on that should continue to drive it but stay tuned we'll see. On top of that, we're getting off to a good start albeit with a conscious slow -- soft opening of both delivery sites. Chris Horvers : And that's really my follow up. And so how is what uptake are you getting in the online grocery and could you compare the two day delivery option versus Instacart. And I think a lot of people ask us is this going to diminish the trip to the warehouse and thus the overall spend that I have goes down and then the margin rate of me as a customer also goes down. Any thoughts on that as well? Richard Galanti : Well look the only data that we know that\u2019s more than three months old or six months old is going back to the original data that we have from what we're doing to Google's shopping express, the longest period of time in the Bay area, where it was strongest. What we typically saw back then and again that did not include fresh though. And then we saw an existing member who is making these numbers up, they were growing their total purchase with us by 3% a year. They do it by more than 3% but they came in a couple of two to four less times and shopped online more times, several more times on that because when they shopped online, it was a lower average ticket that when they came in store. Mind you, it\u2019s a little different we\u2019re seeing a bigger average spend from on the Instacart side. And some of this at the two-day and we\u2019re actually adding some items, I think last time I mentioned we started through our business of about 10 business centers, which covers essentially the entire Continental United States, virtually the entire Continental United States. We started with our 470 or 480 SKUs out of the regular warehouse being serviced out of business centers. We\u2019ve actually added some items to that. And I think the goal was to add a couple of hundred over the next six months. And it\u2019s working so far but it\u2019s new. And so we can\u2019t promise anything. We recognize with fresh how much of it is going to be fill in versus I\u2019ll go few times less to Costco. What gives us a little comfort at this point, but that\u2019s all it is, is the results that we\u2019ve seen from the ways we communicate with our member online. But if you go on right now you\u2019ll see there are several very exciting items that are just in store and while supplies last, that drives traffic and that gets you in the store. So as much as -- everybody is going to know somebody that\u2019s going to shop a lot less in store, because they\u2019re getting all their groceries at Costco or more stuff fresh delivered. At a better price than the day before on Instacart because the prices are better today and even the better price to costco.com, Costco, and even better of course as you come in. And we\u2019ll keep sending that message as well. But I think we\u2019re honestly at two plus years before we really know something on that. Certainly, nine to 12 months before we have any inkling of what it means. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly. Edward Kelly : So I just wanted to ask about price investment. And not so much about the quantity, but I was hoping that you could just maybe talk about the elasticity on price investment in your business and how maybe it defers from some of your traditional competitors. Whether having less SKUs less that you need to focus on less SKU overlap. How that actually impacts what you\u2019re seeing from an elasticity standpoint when you actually do make those investments? Richard Galanti : Well, it was just a year ago when we had slightly disappointing second quarter result, partly because of the change in the number of days the MVMs were out there. And in the explaining why we did it to start with, why is this because overtime whenever you do, it gets a little stale or not in every instance but in some instances. So you try two things. Over those few months and continuing to today, we\u2019re continue to try new things with our vendors as well. And I used water as an example. We were a great value on 40.5 liters of Kirkland Signature and the price maybe different in a given state or something based on transportation. But I think we were at 349, which is the best price out there doing heck of a lot of volume. And now we\u2019re I believe 299 every day. Well, you can imagine our various suppliers said, well how can we do this? Well, you have huge increases in unit volumes. And guess what happened on the way to the forum. The brand just needs to come down in price too, because they're losing market share. I think that's something that's unique about us that limited selection we could take, I get back to that word I used about more octane in the dollar that we use. You take something like that TV example, we did $30 million $40 million on one SKU in fixed rate days. And how do you do that? You do that because one, it's limited two, it's already great price and three, it's even a greater value because of what we can do with partnering with our suppliers on it. And then on top of that, there is these other buckets I gave the example of if you use your Citi Visa card. While we got some signups out of that some applications on that. So I think that tends to be a little different. I gave the example last quarter at the end of that 10 days leading up and through Labor Day weekend when traditional retailers out there selling USDA Choice strip steaks at -- I'm making the number of 849 or 899 and we\u2019re 799 we were at 699. And we locked up lots of newer strip steaks in the weeks preceding that. And we saw a noticeable drive into the warehouse. So I think that having -- it's a lot easier to do where you've got 3,800 items out there versus 50,000 in a supermarket or 100,000 plus in multi-general stores. Edward Kelly : And then I just wanted to ask you about labor generally and tax reinvestment. There has been a lot of talk in the marketplace about investing in labor. I mean, we heard from Target earlier this week about moving the $12 an hour. I mean you were at the upper end of the pay scale for in terms of what you're paying your employees. But there is rising tide just lift all boats here. How are you thinking about this philosophically? Are you looking to maintain historical wage gaps that you've had. How should we be thinking about this for you? Richard Galanti : Well, I think we always want to maintain a significant preview overall. We have to look at all the pieces of it. It's not just the headline starting range. It's not just a one-time bonus, it's also healthcare. If you look at the average used U.S. because every country is different, but relative to what's in that country it\u2019s the same types of premiums. The average U.S. wage of our 90% of our employees were hourly, when they start yesterday or 20 years ago is the 22.25 to 22.5 I believe. On top of that, whether you're part-time or fulltime, you've got a great medical dental admission plan that on average costs the company over $10,000, little over $10,000 where we pay 90% of it roughly. So we have a great -- now by the way that covers -- and independence as well. But on average it's little over two people per covered employee. But at the end of the day, even if the bottom is scaled gets a little closer, the delta between the entire compensation is significantly greater. Notwithstanding that, we do what we're going to do even before tax law changes. We're going to do a little more because we can. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Dan Binder. Dan Binder : I saw you had a program out there on the auto renewals. We get $20 gift card if you signup. I was just curious how effective that program has been. And then also on membership, you've mentioned that there was a slow start to executive conversions in the quarter. I was just curious what you think that was related to and then how are you able to shift the pace on that? Richard Galanti : Well, actually latter question our membership marketing the people are looking at it, I don't know exactly. My guess it has -- we had a strong first quarter where it averaged over 21,000 a week of new. Our sign ups during the quarter were fine. But my guess is it has to do with what did we do a year earlier or how were they collecting certain data. I am just relieved that the second half of the quarter it improved greatly. And my guess is it\u2019s not a big issue. Now the first question? Dan Binder : I just saw through a personal experience you have a $20 gift card offer for signing up on auto renewal for members who haven't done it yet related to the new card. I was just curious how effective that program has been? Richard Galanti : I don't know specifically of that program. I know we do a lot of things as relates to that. We did some -- it sounds silly but we did some programs to sign up get member\u2019s email addresses, which we do a better job when they sign up now as a new member. But we were below 50% with valid email addresses and in two instances in the last few months and about a week or 10 day period we got over a million numbers to get their email addresses by giving them something like $2 off on muffins or something. Dan Binder : So with the improvement in the renewal rates this quarter, trends obviously reversed. Do you anticipate small improvements over the next several quarters based on that experience that you talked about on prior calls with what you saw in Canada? Richard Galanti : I would hope so. I mean, I think just copy what happened over the several quarters after Canada. Canada is now above where it was before the conversion started 2.5 years ago. And Canada went down over six quarters for the conversion quarter six quarters and five quarters out by I believe 100 basis points the renewal rate, and now it\u2019s two or three, tenths of a percent higher than it was before that. U.S. only went down around six tenths of a percent so now it's back up a tenth from that minus six. History should show that that will happen, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Dan Binder : And then just last item on freight. Just curious there has been a number of retailers talking about that pressure. And in some cases, it's been material impact to the earnings outlook. I didn\u2019t really hear much on that today. I was curious if you have any thoughts and how it may impact you? Richard Galanti : Well, the higher freight costs and availability of containers impacts all of us. It's interesting, it's not talked a lot about where I think what it\u2019s made us do is we're doing a better job on back hauling, a more conscious effort. Historically, we always back hauled extra pallets and recycle like cardboard, corrugated and you can basically can make more dollars doing that. But we really had done a lot on back hauling supplies merchandise from vendors. And so I think that's mitigated a little bit of late but I think it's still a net number. My guess would be it's not as impactful to us as it is to traditional retailer based on what I just said. 90% of our goods go through our cross dock people operations. You've got literally thousands put into low single digit thousands -- and several thousand trucks that are going out, trailers that are now not every one of them, but picking up things whether it's produce from Central Washington or Central California or working with suppliers, because we don\u2019t do long haul. But we\u2019re able -- it\u2019s a lot easier to do these kinds of things when you got limited items. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Karen Short. Karen Short : So I just wanted to clarify in terms of tax reform benefits. In terms of the puts and takes we think to the rest of the year and into the fiscal \u201919. Obviously, you commented on investing in employees, investing in price. Is that something that we should expect fairly quickly or is that something both of those that would have a little bit of lead time and you\u2019re still to be determined? Just to clarify. Richard Galanti : I\u2019ll give you a better clarity on that in the next call. We\u2019ve continued to invest in price over the last year and we\u2019re going to continue to that. I think we\u2019ve already started a little of that on the employee side. Something that will be forthcoming, my guess is in the next two months. So it will impact Q3 less than a full Q3 whatever it is. Karen Short : On both wage and price, and then on\u2026 Richard Galanti : On employees. On price, where I starting to do a little that but we\u2019ve also had the benefit of various buckets, it\u2019s not -- all these buckets are fungible. Karen Short : And then I don\u2019t think you gave inflation in the quarter. Wondering if you could give that both at cost and at retail? Richard Galanti : On inflation, I think it\u2019s -- ever so slightly up on a cost basis, which would lead me to believe that flat or slightly down on an retail sales basis given what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019ll go next question and then I\u2019ll get it for you. Karen Short : And just on Instacart, I know you did say that ticket was larger on Instacart. So I guess two questions on Instacart. One is can you maybe give a little more color on how much larger the average spend is or average ticket is on Instacart. And then obviously Sam\u2019s announced the rollout of Instacart as well. Is there anything change with your pricing strategy on your Instacart offering as a function of that announcement? Richard Galanti : Well, to the latter no. I mean our strategy has always to be very competitive. And if we have to be more competitive, we will. And we feel we\u2019re very competitive on the things that we\u2019re doing. What was the first part of your question? Karen Short : Just some quantification on how much bigger the average ticket is? Richard Galanti : Well, when I say it\u2019s a little high average ticket, it\u2019s a little higher average ticket than what we experienced with like Google Shopping Express, which didn\u2019t include fresh. I believe it\u2019s a double-digit number but in the higher double-digits rather than the middle double-digits. As it relates to inflation, when I look at our LIFO in this index that we don\u2019t use for anymore, I am not asking out or accounting people, but at some point we will. If I look at our composite year-to-date fiscal \u201918 among the various categories, it\u2019s deflationary by 14 basis points that\u2019s from our fiscal year-end September 3rd or 4th last year. And I would say overall it\u2019s slightly inflationary, because that is -- and looking at the turnover in the different category. So my guess is it\u2019s -- and in the last four weeks, it was exactly zero. So I would say, this is cost which would tend -- led me to believe that we're slightly -- or definitely deflationary compared to that because we're lowering prices. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom. Chuck Grom : Just trying to understand something here, so no inflation, you're investing more in price. Yet your core on core margins as a percentage of sales were up, I think you said 14 basis points, which was the best performance with the third quarter with three of the four large categories up. So can you just help us understand the improvement in the margins this quarter and looking ahead, any sustainability of that trend? Richard Galanti : Recognizing it's not just the full core-on-core there's so many other little things. An improvement in our Travel business, which is a very high gross margin business, we don't -- the value of that plane ticket and hotel. It's the broker commission with very little SG&A associated with it. So very little cost to sales. All those things help a little bit. I think within the 80% of our business, which is core-on-core, fresh foods, hardlines, softlines and food sundries and talking to our head of merchandising two days ago, probably the two biggest rigs are what we call internally improved D&D. It's where damage and destroy when we're having to mark things down less whatever we get from our vendors. There might be spoilage allowance or returns allowance within something. But generally speaking, we showed an improvement there. And we've also shown a little bit of an improvement with -- now I can't quantify whether that's a basis point or a few, but it's an example. Another one is you take the example of $1000 item that we sell for $1,100 just to make the numbers up. So $100 gross margin on $1,100, it's whatever 9% or whatever it is. If we get an extra 150 off through an MVM, we're now selling it for $950 still making $100 gross margin. So we just improved our gross margin percent. You're talking about billions of dollars a year in the aggregate, low double-digits but still real money. Fresh foods penetration increases generally speaking even though fresh foods, I believe it was slightly up, but fresh foods has a higher margin department. Apparel is a higher margin department. We've had good growth. I think in the three or four years we've seen what we call apparel and to couple of different departments, men's, women's and kids, up 9%-ish compounded for three or four years on $7 billion or so business worldwide. So that tends to be a higher margin. So my guess is it's a little things and part of it is getting our vendors, our suppliers working with them, we don't want just more money from them if we can't drive more sales to make up for it and get more dollars. So all those things help. Chuck Grom : And then just quickly on February. I think you said that hardlines were up low doubles and majors were the highest tracking, I think mid-to-high 20s. Can you just touch that for us what let to the premier? And I presume maybe appliances where we're very strong around February, does that help that? Richard Galanti : Computer is -- not only desktops but importantly laptops and tablets as well and appliances. Those are all very strong, and online has helped us as well in those categories in the aggregate. So some of it has to do with -- I get back to the $150 to $300 off on a TV that's already at incredibly low price if you use your Costco Visa card, all of those things help drive the business. I want to get back to the previous question also on what I could tell you about gross margin. Years ago we started highlighting that because that\u2019s the core business and there's lots of other things like traffic, like gasoline that\u2019s go up or down 300 basis points in gross margin within that department and is 10% of your total Company. Whatever it is, it'll be a little better or a little worse each quarter. I think it\u2019s more important to understand where -- I'm not suggesting I don't know what the next quarter is going to be. But Murphy's Law always tells you, we continue to feel good about what we're doing and there's lots of little pieces that affect that gross margin. Chuck Grom : And then just one housekeeping. You guys said that there\u2019s obviously a sales impact on the quarterly results. I think you said 140 basis points. Just wondering if there was any bottom line impact in 2Q? Richard Galanti : Well, the bottom line impact other than the sales themselves, I mean hopefully we're doing a pretty good job of scheduling hourly employees in the warehouse. When you do a little better than your planned, you beat the heck out of the numbers because you have fewer employees doing the same work and when you miss your number a little bit, sales is richer on the SG&A line. I don't think that's that big of an issue. And probably a bigger issue which I can\u2019t tell you the answer is, I can just tell you what the issue is, would be holidays, paid holidays. When one of those falls in a -- that's more in our monthly budget meetings, our every four week budget meetings when the operators will have to explain some tonights. Payroll percent was up 10 or more basis points, but there was an extra -- particularly around Thanksgiving and Christmas and New Year's, or Easter event, sometimes these things will fall in a different month, different four week period that we have. So that impacts it. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Olive Chen. Oliver Chen : Regarding the e-commerce details, what's ahead with fulfillment in terms of how you're thinking about fulfillment speed and inventory management, and how that may flow through on a longer term basis in terms of CapEx needs and as you think about certain fixed costs associated with the march towards different fulfillment options for the consumer. And the second e-com question is just about engagement. It really sounds like awareness and marketing is a factor in driving traffic to e-com at large. What do you think are the next steps just to improve that engagement over time? Thank you. Richard Galanti : Well, as it relates to fulfillment and the costs, we are spending more money. We're building some actual e-commerce fulfillment centers, in part because we're running out of room in some of the depots where we did it that. I think we're doing one in Tracy California, or Mira Loma, and Annex but it's a major multi double digit millions of dollars. We have a little more inventory in the system in e-commerce because we're fulfilling from closer places as we do more business. We have a greater commitment with this delivery whereas two days us through our business -- through roughly 10 of our business delivery centers with these 500 or so items, that's more inventory in the system right while we do that, so all those things are costing us a little more in that regard that's in the numbers as well and it will continue to be. In terms of -- if you look at a CapEx Company that's a $2.5 billion range, there's always -- just when you think you're done with cross dock operations, we\u2019re adding, expanding some, adding a second one in Japan even though we only have 27 rate units right now, but geographically, it makes sense now. I\u2019m putting one into, I believe, Australia soon. Building a bakery commissary in Canada and a chicken plant in Nebraska and a second meat plant for us in the Midwest, so all those things are a bit additive to us. So I think as it relates to fulfillment, you\u2019ll still see some more, but it\u2019s in the 0 to 200 million a year not -- we\u2019re going to go and have to spend an extra $500 million or itself. And as we go from 0 to 200 million even, what dropped out of the another bucket there but do the same, we have cash flow to do it. We never sat down and said which can we do first because we have to limit what we do based on that ex-amount of dollars. As it relates to awareness and engagement, short-term there is some of the blocking and tackling. I know ecommerce operations, they\u2019ve engaged some outside parties to help with some of the -- what I\u2019ll call targeted marketing engagement 101 and to see what more we can do. But right now, there is still a lot to be done, we\u2019re just getting more email address, getting that over rate to continue to go up in right direction, which it is. Oliver Chen : And you made a lot of progress with buy online pickup in-store. What are you thinking about or what you\u2019re monitoring about what made sense there, and what you think about refrigeration. Will that be an option and a good option or what items are best suited for that program? Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler. Matt Fassler : Richard, my first question relates to the ancillary business. You had a fairly subdued comparison a year ago on gas profitability presumably and obviously this year ancillary was a big contributor. And you indicated that gas was a piece of that and also some of the other businesses that you\u2019ve discussed in Q&A as well. What\u2019s your thought process on gas and its contribution to margin both on the -- based on the current gas price environment, which is relatively stable and also on the comparisons they evolved through last year? Hello? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t what happened there guys. Matt Fassler : I think Oliver might have been in the midst of asking a question when I was called on onto the lot. So you can do that or go to my question first. Richard Galanti : Well, I\u2019m not sure did you hear the answer. I answered the question related to CapEx and expansion of fiscal activates or inventory needs related to driving fulfillment. And then I answered the question he had about awareness. Did you hear that? Matt Fassler : Some of that, so it\u2019s really\u2026 Richard Galanti : Why don\u2019t we go on with your question and [indiscernible] get back on the line. Matt Fassler : Did you hear my question on ancillary, Richard? Richard Galanti : No, I did not. Matt Fassler : The question related to the benefit that you received from ancillary this quarter, which was substantial. And some of it related to gases as you discussed and some to non-cash businesses. And taking a look back at the year ago, your ancillary margins were down sharply, gas I think has something to do with it. So what's your thought process on gas margins intrinsically relative to trend I guess on a dollar basis or penny per gallon basis in the current environment with relatively stable gas prices, particularly as you come up against I guess some more normalized comparisons in the second half of the year? Richard Galanti : Well, a lot of the gas -- the price per gallon is up, profitability has been okay and have been pretty good. And a lot of has to gallons, I think our gallons were up 9%, 9%-10% almost 10% compared to a U.S. industry that's up in the low like 2%. On the ancillaries, I think two things. One, if I look back at last year, there was Bob what's the last year that hit us there was a catch up or something in ancillary? I think that my guess I don't have the exact number in front of me. My guess is that I know we've had strong ancillary performance. My guess is as nothing was called out last year or if it was a little disappointing, it was and so there is probably a little offset there as well. I know that many of the ancillaries are growing nicely and improving margins, bottom line margin. Matt Fassler : And if I can just ask a second question, you're asked about Instacart already. If you think about the customer who is turning to Instacart as the program grows with you. Do you have a sense as to what the impact is or what the contribution is of legacy Costco customers who are now moving to Instacart? And how their behavior changes if at all as they shop Instacart in the store? Richard Galanti : We don't know yet. It's just want to know yet and to do. When we look back at -- again the early days of the in the Bay area with the Google's Shopping Express, we saw it was a net increase in total spender a year with a few ship reduction in store and several deliveries more than offset it. My guess is with fresh being more dominant of course with Instacart, you might have a little bit. And what we're finding is this is more anecdotal, there are plenty of people that are using it simply fulfillment and still coming just as long, but we don't know yet. We're also by the way finding -- signing up members that we didn't have before. And both with the Instacart White Label as well as Costco's two-day grocery where we can deliver to places that are 150 miles from a Costco, and we haven't tried to market to those people yet. Matt Fassler : And based on your comment on size, it sounds like even though you're not for 400 clubs, it sounds like it's not material to the traffic acceleration? Operator : We have our next question comes from Peter Benedict. Peter Benedict : Hey Richard\u2026 Richard Galanti : By the way, I've taken my arms off the table so I don't touch the cord and disconnect. Peter Benedict : Matt\u2019s had a heck of a time with Q&A the last couple of days. But anyway, we\u2019ll move on. Can you give us a sense maybe what percentage of the business today is vertical with you guys owning product from production all the way to sale. And if you're not going to speak any numbers, maybe just which categories is that most present in and where can you where can you take that over the next few years? Richard Galanti : Well, I don\u2019t have a percentage calculated. But where it is, we have a hotdog plant that makes all of the Christmas season hotdogs for United States, almost all of them were at capacity. We have a meat plant in California that is over 4 million pounds a week four or five SKUs just for us. It's our meat plant. We have two optical grinding labs that grind 5.5 million to 6 million pair of prescription glasses that we sell every year. I guess you could say we have two central fill facilities both for filling prescriptions for our own pharmacies as well as mail order for ours and a few others of third parties. We're building a major chicken plant in Nebraska that will allow us to source ourselves about 100 million chickens a year, which is less than a quarter of our needs. Although, another 30% to 40% our needs are sourced in business what\u2019s referred to as dedicated plants. We're not the only one that does it using one of the three or four large providers that we shared all the profitability and costs related to that plant. But to say we think we can do that better than others, because we have them do many fewer SKUs than traditional retailers in that area. We do some package of candies and nuts so that\u2019s semi-vertical. We have a bakery commissary that we've just started production in Canada, that was done out of necessity in the two largest commissaries that they serve some of our bakery needs were acquired by the two largest grocery retailers over the last few years. But in hindsight, it seems to be working and trying to think what else. We do lots the packaging of gift baskets and clamshell type stuff that we do ourselves and that's somewhat vertical not completely. So I don't know what all that adds up to. My guess it\u2019s 10% or less in total maybe 5%. But at the end of the day where is it going to go in the future, I think you'll see more fees related to sourcing of foods and commodities and proteins whether it's high house produce or doing things with chickens and cows, I don't know. Peter Benedict : On ecommerce, any plans to roll out the signage and the tablets beyond those. I think you said 195 clubs that are in today. And just how is the labor in the club you used to facilitate the buy online pick up stores. Is that a new role or are you just taking existing folks and then repurposing them? Richard Galanti : No, we aren\u2019t rolling it out. First of all, we have employees that actually have tablet with them and particularly in areas like electronics and perhaps home furnishings seasonal items, big ticket items that in likelihood they are there and looking at it, but they still choose to buy it online. In some cases like white goods, you can only -- you can look at it there but you can only have it received and ordered online. So we\u2019re doing it but it\u2019s working so far and we expect to see in more locations. Peter Benedict : And then just with the bulk of buy online pickup in-store. How are you staffing that from a labor perspective? Richard Galanti : Just staff, I mean, they\u2019re going through training. They are going through third-party training in some cases we\u2019re working with our vendors in some cases. Peter Benedict : And then last just housekeeping. The D&A number, I don\u2019t know if you gave that for the second quarter. Do you guys have that? Richard Galanti : Which one? Peter Benedict : Depreciation? Richard Galanti : It will be in the queue, my apologies, we don\u2019t. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin. Scott Mushkin : So I want to give another shot at the ecommerce question on margin. Richard, we\u2019ve talked about over the last couple of years and the challenges of bringing omni-channel to retailer. I was just wondering if you could talk about how you\u2019re thinking about as you slowly go down that omni-channel road and what we should think about as margin? It seems like you\u2019re almost pricing differently in the different channels. But I was wondering if you could frame it for us as that grows as a part of your business? Clearly, not hurting yet. Richard Galanti : Well, first of all with delivery, you\u2019ve got -- somebody has got to pay for it. In some cases, we\u2019re testing to see how to include it in the price and do we charge for it, do we subsidize it, whatever. We\u2019re trying lots of different things. When you say going slowly, arguably we do a lot of things slowly. We started with ecommerce slowly 15 to 20 years ago. I look at it as, if there is some out there and that says, here in the 50 things we should be doing, let us with the menu of 50 things and we\u2019re going to choose the 10 or 50 or how that we see works for us in our environment. And every time we -- so far when do these things it works and it works our way. And it\u2019s not unlike when we first started to business that you can\u2019t sell only 3,800 items or whatever it is and have limited categories, we recognize that value is more than just great -- the lowest price on the relative quality and quantity of something where we are second to none. But on top of that, convenience and delivery from some is as well but we can\u2019t be everything to everybody. So far that\u2019s working very well for us even as we move in some cases slowly in some of these new areas. I think we\u2019re fortunate that we\u2019re able to find those niches. And these are item business, the same concerns the people have about are we getting our share of millennials, we are. Are they buying as much? Well, they\u2019re buying as much as the old gen whatever is did, when they were that age. But what we\u2019re finding is items that pertain well for that and we\u2019ll see. And which of these are complementary? Again, I don\u2019t know where we are five years from now. I know we have some things that we\u2019ve done on the table, we all do now. I know there\u2019s some things that we\u2019re going to be doing over the next year or so to continue to grow it, and we\u2019ll see where we go. Scott Mushkin : So my second question is with the tax and the reinvestment. Any thoughts like, our survey to consumers are they just ask is that the two stress point for consumers and going to the store at this point, parking lots and check out. Any thought on trying to ease, I mean it's a good problem to have. But mean the checkout process at Costco can back way up and of course the parking lots can. Any thoughts of using some of the money to try to ease those two friction points for consumers? Richard Galanti : Well, what\u2019s interesting is we've got 4% traffic growth year-on-year-on-year and we put a lot of time and effort in front end to speed you out. One of the things we're concerned about with order online and pick up in store is we don't want you there if you're not going to come through. People talk about having urgent care or doc-in-the box things. We don't want you to sit for an hour waiting for a shot, and not shopping. But as it relates specifically to front end, we continue to expand, in the last probably eight years, nine years, we have reduced -- we have spent in terms of the average number of customers through an open register, an open staffed register, has gone from the low-40s to the low-50s per hour. Now it may not seem like that but it's like being in the red light. It seems like longer than it is. That being said, I just had an offside meeting last week for a day and half. And one of the things we'll be rolling out do things at the front end, testing in about 50 locations that should continue to work on that. In terms of the parking lots, where we can and we expand the parking lots beyond that, I can't tell you a whole lot. By the way the other thing is we\u2019ll continue to open an infield and cannibalize units. As one of the examples I\u2019ve given in the last few calls for another question was last year we opened effectively our fourth unit on the east side of Seattle and the Woodville, Kirkland, Issaquah area and a fourth one in San Jose and California. In both instances, we went from roughly, I'll call it, 60,000 members per location in the three, or 65,000, 180,000 to 195,000 members among free warehouses to maybe another 5,000 members in the market. But we added that of cannibalization $110 million to $125 million of annual sales, which is great. And so that certainly is a relief point also. Now, I can't speak specifically one of our highest volume units in the Continental United States is in Westbury. Notwithstanding the fact that we have bought it was a retail big retail store next store at the supermarket maybe or a Kmart. But adding lots of things to it and it's hard to get another location and you're buying. So we always have items like that but we'll keep working on it. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky. Chuck Cerankosky : I just want to explore a little bit the 15 stores, well actually 18. Flat of course in the current fiscal year, which we think about in terms of preopening expense in that period and any SG&A burden. And then how having those clubs open sets you up for the new year for fiscal '19, especially going into the holiday season. Richard Galanti : Well some of the preopening will start before, because as you open, let\u2019s say the first several that opened in the first several weeks of Q4 much of the preopening is incurred in the monthly up to it but in Q4 is also for 16 weeks versus 12. So my guess it'll be -- clearly be higher in Q4. And I don't know necessarily how it sets us up. There may have been a few week trends we pushed to get into this year just to try to get them open. So that saves you a little bit but we do that every year. Chuck Cerankosky : All right, thank you. Richard Galanti : Thank you everyone. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You all may now disconnect.",

My name is Josh, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. You may begin your conference. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Josh, and good afternoon to everyone. I'll start of course by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. And that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported our operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the 12 weeks that ended on May 13th. Net income for the quarter was $750 million or $1.70 per share that compared to $700 million or $1.59 per share last year in the third quarter. Last year in the third quarter, net income was positively impacted by the $82 million or plus $0.19 per share tax benefit and that was in connection with the $7 per share special cash dividend that we had done at that time. I\u2019ll start by reviewing our third quarter operating results and then allow some time of course for Q&A. In terms of sales, net sales for the quarter came in at $31.62 billion, or 12.1% increase over last year\u2019s third quarter sales of $28.22 billion. Net sales for the first 36-weeks of fiscal 2018 increased 12.0% to 95.02 billion, up from $84.82 billion last year to date \u2013 last year for the first three quarters year-to-date. In terms of comparable sales, which are reported in the press release, for the 12-week period U.S. was 9.7, excluding the impact of gas inflation it was 7.7. Canada on a reported basis for the 12 weeks comps were 11.3, and ex-gas inflation and FX impact was up 4.8. Other international reported at 11.8, ex-gas inflation and FX 5.8. So, all told, total company at 10.2% comp and ex-gas inflation and FX up 7.0%. E-commerce, which we, of course separate out here is 36.8% for the 12-weeks, and 35.5% ex-FX. So that continues strong. Similar statistics in the press release for the 36-weeks year-to-date. In terms of third-quarter sales metrics, third-quarter traffic or shopping frequency was up 5.1% both worldwide and within the U.S., strengthening foreign currencies relative to U.S. dollar impacted sales by approximately 145 basis points to the positive, and gasoline inflation added an additional 170 basis points. Cannibalization weighed on the comp to the tune of minus 60 basis points. Our average front-end transaction or front-end ticket was up 4.9%, and again excluding the benefits from both gas inflation and FX that average ticket would have been up somewhere in the mid-high single digits about 1.7%, 1.8%, up. Next on the income statement and membership fee income, reported in the quarter $737 million, up $93 million from $644 million during Q3 of last year or up 14.4%. The benefit of strong foreign currencies was about 9 million of that $93 million increase or ex that it would have been $84 million. Now, of the $93 million increase year-over-year, a little over half related to the membership fee increases that we have taken in the last year, year-and-a-half. The majority of which came from the $5 and $10 annual fee increases taken last June 1 in the U.S. and Canada. And a small balance of that from the fee increases taken other international operations starting back in September of 2016. We will continue by the way to see membership fees based on the deferred accounting, the June 1, 2017 increases in U.S. and Canada last year. We continue to see the benefit of that year-over-year increase in the membership fee line. It will peak in Q4, this coming quarter, this 16-week quarter and then still year-over-year increases, but all are \u2013 at least three may be four of them, all of next year in fiscal 2019 as well. In terms of membership fee renewal rates, our U.S. and Canada member renewal rates at Q3 end came in at \u2013 were 90.1%, similar to where they stood a quarter earlier at 90.1. Slight uptick just rounding to the 90.1. Worldwide rates improved to 87.5%, up from 87.3% 12 weeks ago at Q2 end, with the uptick in renewal rates and other international operations led by Asia, both Taiwan, Japan and Korea. In terms of number of members at Q3 end, in terms of total number of households at the end of Q2 it stood at 50.4 million and 12 weeks later at the end of Q3 is now \u2013 it then stood at 50.9 million. Total cardholders, 92.2 million a quarter ago, 12 weeks ago, and at Q3-end 93.0 million. During the fiscal quarter, we had two new openings. Also, at Q3-end, as of Q3-end our paid executive member base stood at 19.0 million households. That\u2019s an increase of 199,000 households from 12 weeks earlier or about 17,000 new Gold Star members per week. Related to the benefit from last year's fee increases that year-over-year quarterly fee increase volumes I mentioned continue to benefit both Q4 and into several quarters next year, but on a diminished amount year-over-year quarter. Going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the third quarter was lower year-over-year by 46 basis points, coming in at 11.05% during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 11.51%. Now that minus 46 basis point figure year-over-year on a reported basis, excluding gas inflation it was minus \u2013 it would have been minus 28 and let me again ask you as I usually do to jot down just a couple of columns for Q3 2018. The first one would be, as reported, and the second one would be excluding the impact of gas inflation. The five-line items, the first one would be merchandise core. In Q3 2018, on a reported basis that was down year-over-year by 33 basis points and ex-gas inflation down by 17 basis points. Ancillary businesses reported minus 10 basis points year-over-year, minus 6 ex-gas inflation, 2% reward plus 2 as reported and flat without gas inflation. Other minus 5 and minus 5, and I\u2019ll talk about that in a second. So, total if you add up those two columns, on a reported basis again, gross margin was lower by 46 basis points, ex-gas inflation lower by 28 basis points. As I mentioned, looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales, so quarter-on-quarter if you will, margins year-over-year and in Q3 were lower actually by minus 4 basis points. Subcategories within core gross margin year-over-year in Q3. Food and sundries was up slightly and hardlines, soft lines, and fresh foods. The other three components of core were down just slightly. The slightly year-over-year core on core gross margins in third quarter resulted from our continuing investment in price to drive sales and widen the value gap between us and our competition. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin, I think were reported down 10 \u2013 down 6 ex-gas. Some of that has increased gas sales penetration, which is a much lower margin business rather other parts of it is - some of the other ancillary businesses were down a little bit as well. 2% reward was flat ex-gas as I mentioned, and other, which was a minus 5 year-over-year comparison, 5 basis points. Last year, we were incurring some incremental costs where we have been, as I mentioned last two quarters we\u2019ve been incurring some incremental costs primarily related to the rollout of our new centralized returns facilities. This will continue to impact us for one more quarter in Q4. In each of the prior two quarters I had mentioned on a sequential basis on a year-over-year. In Q1, we estimate it was about 7 basis point negative impact, in Q2 minus 6, and in Q3 minus 5, and again there will be some small detriment I assume in Q4 and then we will have anniversaried that. Moving to SG&A, our SG&A percentage in Q3 year-over-year was lower or better by 32 basis points on a reported basis and ex-gas inflation better or lower by 16 basis points, coming in at 9.98% of sales this year reported compared to 10.30 last year. Like with gross margin, I will ask you to take the two columns. First one is of reported Q3 2018, and the second column would be, excluding the impact of gas inflation for Q3 2018. First one, operations, better or plus 26 basis points on a reported basis and plus 13 basis points or lower in ex-gas. Central, minus 1 and minus 3. Stock compensation plus 2 and plus 1. Other plus 5 and plus 5. So, if you add those two columns up. The first column would add up to the reported 32 basis point improvement in SG&A and again ex-gas inflation it would be plus 16 basis points. Basically, it\u2019s all about sales. Core operations, lower better strong topline sales lead to improvement in payroll benefits and other variable fixed costs generally speaking. Central expense was higher year-over-year as you can see in the chart we just made by one basis point on a reported basis and three without gas, primarily related to our continuing IT efforts.  Stock compensation again lower by little against strong sales help that. Other, better by five. That really is nothing this year. Last year, we pointed out that there were two non-recurring legal items in Q3 last year totaling $14 million or 5 basis points. And we didn\u2019t have any detriment related to that this year. Next on the income statement is preopening. Preopening this year came in at $8 million lower by $7 million from last year's $15 million. This year in Q3, as I mentioned, we had two openings; one in Mexico, and one in Korea. Last year, we had three openings. One each in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Last year in the number we also had some additional spend in Q3 relating to the fourth quarter openings last year in France and Iceland. Upcoming in Q4 this year we have 15 total openings, 13 net new units, plus 2 relocations. That compares to 12 gross and net locations last year in the quarter. All told, reporting operating income in Q3 came in at $1.67 billion or up $99 million or 10% higher than year-over-year than last year's 968. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense came in at $16 million higher year-over-year at $37 million this year that compares to $21 million a year ago. That\u2019s mostly a result of last May's $3.8 billion debt offering debt offering that we did in conjunction with our special dividend. Interest income and other was higher or better year-over-year by $23 million in the quarter. Actual interest income and mostly interest income for the quarter was better or higher by $6 million. We also benefited year-over-year comparison by various FX items to the tune of $17 million. That\u2019s a number that fluctuates both ways, and generally speaking, it\u2019s in the zero to $15 million range, but this one was plus 17. Overall, pre-tax income was higher by 11% or $106 million in the quarter coming in at $1.71 billion compared to last year's $965 million. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the quarter third quarter this year came in at 28.8%, compared to last year's reported tax rate of 26.8. Now, last year of course on a normalized basis, I mentioned that we had that $82 million tax benefit related to the potential dividend. Last year's normalized rate was 35.3. For fiscal 2019, based on our current estimates, which of course are always subject to change, we anticipate our effective total company tax rate for the entire year with the change in U.S. tax rates benefiting the entire year. The tax rate to be approximately 28%, as we will have the full fiscal year under the new U.S. Federal rates. Before I leave the subject of tax law changes, I'll make a couple of comments on that in terms of what our plans are viz-a-viz the savings. As I had mentioned last quarter end, we really don\u2019t expect any major changes to our capital allocation plans. We generate good cash and pretty much do the things that we want to do, in terms of expansion and in terms of regular dividend and in terms stock buybacks as well. As mentioned on last year's earnings call, I said we would use some of the income tax savings in the U.S. to benefit our U.S. employees and that there will be increases in the early wage rates. Effective June 11, our U.S. starting wages will increase from 13 and 13.50 an hour to 14 and 14.50 an hour. So, $1 an hour for entry level. With all other hourly warehouse employees receiving hourly increase of anywhere from $0.25 to $0.50 per hour. The estimated annualized cost of these increases will impact about 130,000 plus employees in the United States, will be $110 million to $120 million pre-tax, with Q4 being impacted by little more than $25 million pretax. We have been investing, second, next we have been investing and we will continue to invest some of the savings to drive our business. This will certainly include investing in price, as well as other activities. Some of the tax savings this way will fall in the bottom line indirectly by investing and driving value and sales. And then some of the tax savings will go straight to the bottom line. A few other items of note, in terms of expansion, I mentioned we have 15 total openings scheduled for the upcoming 16-week fiscal fourth quarter, which include two re-lows. So, we will have 13 net openings. That would put as at 21 net new openings for the fiscal year. 25 total, less four re-lows. In Q1, we opened seven locations net of five. In Q2, we opened one. In Q3, as I mentioned, we opened two. And for all of fiscal 2018, again, the 21 net-new. Of those 21 net-new, little under two-thirds of them will be in the U.S. Additionally, for fiscal 2018, we will relocate before, all of those in the U.S. and those were relocated to better and larger facilities. As of Q3-end, total warehouse square footage stood at $108 million square feet. In terms of stock buybacks in Q3, $54 million was expanded. So, Q3 year-to-date for the 36 weeks we repurchased $233 million worth of stock or 1.337 million shares at an average price of 174.30 per share. In terms of our e-commerce activities. E-commerce, we currently operate e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, UK, Mexico, Korea and Taiwan. Total e-commerce sales for the third quarter were up 37% year-over-year. And again, that was Q3 of 36.8, year-to-date 36.1 and for the four weeks of April, which we have previously reported was up 43.1%. We continue improving and slightly expanding our offerings. We have been helped of course by improved member service and better search and check out and returns processes, but first and foremost we\u2019re delivering greater value to members and more people are actually are looking at it, opening their emails and transacting. This stuff works and we will continue to see \u2013 we believe to see some good results there. In the third quarter, our site traffic conversion rates and orders will continue to improve year-over-year and again we would expect that to continue at least in the near-term. Online grocery, both our dry grocery two-day delivery and our same-day fresh delivery through Instacart both of these were rolled out last October and continue to grow nicely. Still a small percentage of the total company, we are growing and we're seeing good things from it both in existing markets, plus in some cases in markets where an existing Costco might be a little further away. We continue to improve the online merchandise and services offerings with hot buys and buyer picks with buy online and pick up in store, some limited big-ticket items, like jewelry tapped with some laptops, and most recently handbags. One other additional comment on that is we\u2019re seeing that plus or minus half, about half, a little under little over of those people will come in and shop as well before they pick up the item. Another example of how we\u2019re seeing some of the stuff benefit of the benefit as I have given examples in the past, most recent probably good example is household furniture. Historically, this was only in warehouse in generally for eight or so weeks per year. Now, it\u2019s online or 52 weeks and we're seeing good increases in sales there, incremental sales, similar to our success in selling appliances that I have discussed in the past. Overall, all these efforts are positively impacting our business both online and in warehouse that are helping our sales momentum and increasing member awareness of our digital presence at the same time. We are seeing good traffic increases and hopefully we can continue these types of activities.  Overall, omnichannel is certainly working to enhance and increase our business. One last example, we know how in 220 of our roughly 520 U.S. locations where I\u2019ll call e-commerce product showcases and online ordering capabilities. All U.S. locations will have something in place by this year's upcoming fall holiday season. In terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending June 3 next week on June 6, and our fiscal 2018 fourth quarter scheduled earnings release date for the 16-week fourth quarter ending September 2. This will be after the market closes on Thursday October 4, with the earnings call that afternoon at 2 PM Pacific time. I do want to point out that last year, fiscal fourth quarter were 17 weeks, this year it is 16 weeks. So, keep that in mind as you plan in your numbers. As a reminder, last year's fourth quarter was 17 weeks as I mentioned. With that, I\u2019ll open it up for Q&A, and Josh I\u2019ll turn it back over to you for that. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Hi, Richard. My first question is on the gross margin. The core on core has been roughly flattish to down a little bit low single digits, I think you said down four, I don't you don't guide to it, but I wanted to ask if that\u2019s roughly the ballpark that we should think about or is that a consequence of just how the margins of the business and the sales play out? Richard Galanti : Starting with the first part of the question was, I know you don't want to comment on it. Look at the end of the day, there is lot of moving parts to it. All I can tell you is, we\u2019ve been fortunate to have a few different buckets of monies to be able to do a lot of things starting with the credit card transition, continuing with membership fee increase, continuing with the income tax and you add a little too that some of the Sam's closings. All these things we were able to do. We feel very good about what we're doing and the other thing is, as you have all heard over the years, when costs are going up, we want to be the last to go up and when prices are going down, the costs are going down we want to be the first to go down.  When you look at some of the things that have happened where there is inflationary freight costs, those things generally are now in there, but we, we pride ourselves on holding off on some of those things. So, I can't really tell you where we will go at this other than we feel good about what we\u2019re doing. Keep in mind also that some of this has to do with not just core on core, but some of the penetration, the sales penetration of things like low margin gas. We feel really good about where we are pricing wise and what we're doing with it and driving our business. Simeon Gutman : And the 110 to 120 of pretax wage investments, do you think about investment in price any differently or the two are unrelated in the way you manage the business? Richard Galanti : Well there are two and keep in mind, given that the income tax changes were unique and don't happen every day we certainly felt the right thing to do was to allow it certainly to help our employees as well as drive our business and improve the member value. I look at how we have done it. We feel pretty good about what we\u2019ve done and where we\u2019re going with it, but we don't look at and let\u2019s take a third, a, third and a third. This is just how we're doing it. And we want to, we recognize that there is a lot of things to be able to do it, and if you go back years ago, when they looked at my comment on some will fall in the bottom line, we view that as part of the process here to. Simeon Gutman : Okay, thanks Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good evening and thanks a lot for taking my question. So, when you look at the e-com transaction, how are those impacting your profitability, both e-commerce transaction itself and those that are being picked up in stores that half of those include a shop and visits to the warehouse. Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, the buy online and shop in stores is some limited high ticket small size items, where in many cases we find members would love to buy it, but didn't want to, couldn\u2019t have it delivered to where they worked, didn\u2019t want to leave it on their doorstep. And what we found is, which we were a little surprised by is when they do come in, a lot of them come in and shop first and then pick it up, and shop quite a bit frankly. It\u2019s a small piece of the business. We\u2019re not looking to have people come in and have to refrigerate stuff while and order online and then we have got to have refrigerators and freezers filled waiting for them to come. These are limited areas where we think we can drive business and provide that member service. Michael Lasser : And is it having an impact on your margin structure at this point? Richard Galanti : No, not really. Keep in mind, like a lot of companies out there, we're doing a lot of things. If you think about what we're doing with the two delivery things, there is some inefficiencies are starting it up and ramping it up and buying equipment for box making and whatever else. We're not really talking about all these little things, but there is things there. But no \u2013 when we're doing some of the things, hot buys, some of that is our vendors, and some of that is - some of the monies that we have to be able to use. As I mentioned before, I think that for every dollar that we had to use, we feel we get kind of a bigger bang for that buck than others simply because of limited targeted items. Michael Lasser : And my follow-up question is, this year's third quarter ended a week later into May and began a week later in February, so you probably got a higher volume week and gave up a lower volume week, did that calendar shift effect have any impact on your sales and profitability in the third quarter? Richard Galanti : Not for the quarter, no. Michael Lasser : Thank you. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. Chuck Grom : Hi, thanks Richard. On the digital front, any learnings so far from Costco grocery in particular, are you seeing a new shopper or is it an existing shop that\u2019s making an incremental purchase and then separately can you remind us of the SKU count online today and where you see it going forward? Richard Galanti : Well on the last question on the SKU count, I think it\u2019s approaching 10,000. We don't see it getting a lot bigger, but you keep in mind over the last couple of quarters we\u2019ve added lots of what I call velocity items, food and sundries items, health and beauty aid items, some apparel items, which is getting people to open their emails if you will and think about coming back more often to take a look without us having to remind them. And so, all those things we will continue to see. And I'm sorry the first part of the question? Chuck Grom : [Indiscernible] Richard Galanti : I think, it\u2019s really too early to tell. We clearly are getting some customers, in the case of the two day, which is dry, it covers the entire continental United States. We are picking up some members that we never had before because we are 50 to 100 miles away from the nearest physical Costco, and we're really just, and I talked in the last quarter about there has really been very limited marketing of that as we\u2019re just getting it up and running and rolling it out. We, and it is too early to tell what impact if any it has in terms of same-day grocery. Historically, we saw in some early cases back in like the Bay area, which did not refresh by the way, you saw perhaps an existing member shop a few less times that year, but shopped several times online, in some cases there is this fill-ins and they are still coming in. The sum of the two was still better, a little better than it was before. I think we will have to have see. As you might expect, we're going to figure out how to do it. So, it is not, it benefits us in some ways, that I think we're fortunate that some traditional retailers don't have that same benefit. Chuck Grom : Okay, thank you. And then just on, it has been a while since you\u2019ve updated us on your long-term club goals, just curious where you see saturation, where do you think you could see the club base looking out maybe 5 and 10 years? Richard Galanti : Well we have to see. 21 this year is probably a few less than we had thought we will be able to get done. Some of that is couple of delays, some of it is international, it takes a little longer. Some of it is, our conviction particularly in the some of the newer countries. We want to grow people there and as you know if you look back at Japan, I think we got to 6 over in the first five years and fast forward several years, we are in the mid-to-high 20s. We got to 3 over 2.5 to 3 years, 2.5 years plus in Australia. So, I think you will see those numbers go up. If I had to guess and it is an honest educated guess, somewhere in the mid-20s over the next 5 years, probably a couple of year in business centers, 2 years to 3 years, who knows.  And in terms of U.S., on the basis of 520, today in the U.S. is somewhere in the 15-ish range for the next few years and logic will say maybe it becomes a little bit, maybe it is helped a little by business centers we will have to see. We still, we keep finding and surprising ourselves as it relates to the ability to put another unit in and even getting somebody to cut their drivetime if you will to the nearest Costco from 30 minutes to 15 minutes, can be very meaningful as we have seen in places like San Jos\u00e9 and Redmond and other places. So, we will see. Chuck Grom : Great. And then last question, just on the groceries, you said, the core and core down four, anything unusual in the quarter was there any mix pressure or any inventory issues given some of the weather and it sounds like most of the price investments have been proactive, just wondering if you guys have done a deeper dive looking to elasticity on some of those price investments? Richard Galanti : Elasticity is not a word we will ever use or think about. We are merchants and we are constantly driving value. I think you\u2019ve heard us say before, this is all about us, who's our toughest competitor it is us. And, I think there is a little sales penetration detriment in the number and that was part of that. But again, there is lots of moving parts and pieces not just core on core but other ancillary businesses and again I got to tell you, we feel pretty good about our pricing ability and our ability to drive the bottom-line through good sales and the like. Chuck Grom : Great. Thanks, and good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. John Heinbockel : So Richard a couple of things maybe along the lines of convenience, when you think about both this inside the box, it has been much thought about doing more items and maybe bulkier items that take up space that kind of get them out of the cart, pick them up on your way out and if so would that, do you guys think that would lead to more items per shopping trip, if people were kind of buying paper and beverage not in the box, but on the way out or in the lot? Richard Galanti : The short answer is, no. I mean, will there be some things added to the buy online and the pick of store, I'm sure there will be few other things, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019re saying, hey what else can we do there. We're doing a little of that because the few things that we have done have worked, but also take something simply as bulk paper goods and bulk order. It\u2019s kind of like where is that located in warehouses? In the back, what does that make you do? It makes you go through the whole warehouse. Not unlike having the fresh foods at the supermarket in the back, as we do as well. So, I think there is lots of different ways you can skin that cap and I don't see us doing a lot of that. I'm sure it will change and increase somewhat over time. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then secondly, you think about, I think in the past, maybe the topic of smaller box size comes up, but you\u2019ve always liked the economics of the large club, so if you think about maybe a box that\u2019s half as big more convenient playing in the what\u2019s for dinner tonight space to a greater degree does that ever become an attractive option for you or not just because the economics don't match the big box? Richard Galanti : Never say never, but it is not on the plate right now, I mean, it\u2019s not even on the second page of the plate. So, we feel we\u2019ve got plenty going on in terms of regular sized boxes and big sized boxes in terms of business centers, in terms of some vertical things that we're doing like in the fresh and the protein area, some more things you want on a private label, and would delivery. I mean, we have got a lot of good \u2013 in our view good things going on and pretty happy that there is plenty of regular sized box opportunities. John Heinbockel : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Your line is open. Karen Short : Hi, thanks. Couple of questions. I just want to clarify, I guess in terms of the tax dollars, you know you did say dollars would go to investing in price. So, I guess the first question I have is, a, you now asking about the gross margin a little differently, was that something that maybe tick up a little bit this quarter because you did mention fresh margins were down this quarter and I think they were up in the prior quarter, or should we kind of expect to see a little bit more pressure on the core gross margin going forward as you do take those dollars and invest? Richard Galanti : I cannot tell you where it'll go in the future. What I can tell you is that it is not just the tax dollars, it is the credit card, it is the mem fee increase. There is a lot of things going on out there and we have been able as freight costs have skyrocketed in the last year for everybody to hold that a little bit, absolutely. Ultimately, we have got to catch up on that and we feel comfortable holding it and catching up at some point as we have. And so, I think we feel, all I could tell you is, we feel quite comfortable as to what we're doing and how we're doing it, and that we feel very comfortable that we are our own toughest competitor and we control those about a little bit at this point. We don't know what\u2019s going to happen in the future, but I don't think that\u2019s changing very quickly as we come up with new things to do. Karen Short : Okay. And so, I guess I was also wondering, I mean obviously you\u2019ve had unbelievably strong sales now going on almost a year, but more recently I guess what I'm wondering is, do you think that the strength in sales is just a function of strong or not that you weren\u2019t executing before, but stronger execution and price points or do you think there is some benefit that you're seeing from a consumer perspective from tax dollars, tax refund dollars in their pockets, do you have any color on that? Richard Galanti : The only color we get is, it relates to tax reform dollars is what we \u2013 what you and I and others here and read in the paper. As you hear from some economists, certainly we\u2019ve heard from some of our business partners whether it is the credit card issuers and networks or other types of third parties. And it seems like there is a little there, but it\u2019s hard to really dictate that. We know that pricing, investing in price works, and we know that it tends to work generally very well such that even in working with suppliers and in some cases, we will partner with them to get to that do just a lower price point as it drives more volume, you know not have to take on any of that ourselves. So, there\u2019s lots of different ways to do it, but I think that one of the things that we have commented on of course is also some of the low hanging fruit and benefits that we have because of the things we hadn't done historically. You look at the examples of appliances and look at the examples of furniture, used to be if you wanted to buy household furniture items, if you don't have a truck you will get one and call your friend because we don't deliver. That has changed anyway, but even so we're still doing very well in-store for those 8 or 10 weeks of this example, but all of a sudden, we have got 40 plus more weeks where we are doing truly incremental business in the hundreds of millions of dollars and growing. Those are the things that I think that make us additional, it\u2019s not just price, price is in the top of our list, but beyond that there is other things that I think are benefiting us. Certainly, fresh foods and what we have done there in terms of the quality and the consistency and coming up with new items. Karen Short : Great. Okay. And then last question from me, just inflation at core and at retail at this quarter? Richard Galanti : I think on the food and sundries side, it has picked up a little bit, and again talking to the buyers is a big chunk of that has to do with freight and I think one of the analyst reports out there and the title is called frightening changes to cost, but at the end of the day it rains on all of us and I think on the food and sundries side it was up in the 2% to 3% range and probably two-thirds of X it was more related to freight related costs. Karen Short : And that\u2019s at cost or at retail and both? Richard Galanti : That\u2019s at cost. Needless to say, if there is 35%, 40% of your business, 200 or more cost basis and core or core is down four, ultimately you got to pass that on, and ultimately, we have some additional monies to be able to use towards that to be more competitive and so. Karen Short : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is open. Peter Benedict : Hi, thanks Richard. The move on wages, is that, does that effectively pull forward what you might have done or what was likely to happen, I guess next spring when I think you guys do for the next employment agreement? Richard Galanti : If you look back over many, many years. We have a three-year employee agreement. The last one was March 2016. So, the one important thing in there of course is where do our topics scale hourly employees move each March of 2017 and 2018 and 2019, that\u2019s prescribed in that March 2016, new employee agreement. And so that\u2019s prescribed, and historically we\u2019ve always done something in top of scale. I don't see that changing. We have once or twice moved the bottom of the scale up. We will see where tomorrow brings, this probably won't be the last time, particularly and so we will have to see, but we, I don't, we really looked at it independently of that, ultimately if you're going to do something and if you're doing something now, it doesn't mean you're not going to do something on top of that next time and again I am not trying to be coy. I expect whatever most people are going to do we're going to do a little more. Peter Benedict : Not that make sense, a quick question on the competitive tone in the market, I mean you just got done saying earlier that you're always your toughest competitor, but maybe can you comment on what you're seeing as you guys are looking at some of your competitors or the big club or non-club with all these tax dollars moving around or are you noticing them being sharper in any areas? Richard Galanti : You know, I honestly believe while there has been some, I think all companies, not just in retail tend to, I am sure many companies feel that one there is a desire to use some of this to help employees to share that wealth if you will, to drive their business. I don't think it has been life changing for any company, and since that, one of the questions we were asked right after the announcement that we said that on an annualized basis next year, if you do simple map roughly 7 percentage points of our effective rate from the 35-ish to the 28-ish on you take the pretax dollars it is some low $300 million after tax benefit.  And somebody asked a question about does that mean you might do a special dividend? Well our special dividends, the three that we\u2019ve ever done are the $2 billion to $3 billion cost range. So, this really doesn't change anything there. We\u2019re already generating cash flow to do other things, and maybe we are in the higher quartile then we will position financially, but I think overall [indiscernible] from what I have read does it help the consumer? Sure, it helps the consumer. Some of the consumers as employees are benefiting from it and all that is good. Certainly, competition in general is benefiting consumers in terms of pricing. We are fortunate that pricing mode continues to widen to our benefit. Peter Benedict : Okay, thanks for that and my last question is just around the executive membership numbers. Those were growing, call it high single digits in the past, even last year, this year they are starting to grow more like mid-single, some deceleration there, can you just talk about maybe the opportunity to continue to grow executive membership here in the U.S. and then thoughts on maybe when you could be adding that to some newer markets internationally? Thank you. Richard Galanti : Sure. Well in terms of total membership we feel again pretty good about it is probably depends on when you are opening and where you are opening and the last couple of quarters we have opened three units I think in the last two quarters, we got a bunch coming. It also depends where you are opening. As you know, I've given the examples of where we have done and infill in a very strong market like San Jose area or Redmond, Washington area in Seattle. We might average in 3 existing locations 60,000 or 65,000 members per building at only 3,000 to 5,000 new members in that new building but add net of cannibalization $100 million to $120 million of annual sales in the first new year, first 12 months of that new opening. And so that is all about being close to your customer and driving more business. What was the first part of your question again? Peter Benedict : [Indiscernible] how much core opportunity in that internationally? Richard Galanti : I'm sorry. The other thing is as we have said that you are aware of, in international we tend to do outsized number of signups. Again, there has been as many as right now. Lastly, I mean we have done, I think in the past three or four many social group on type activities and they were quite well, so well that we don't want everybody to get used to it, so we don\u2019t do that often. We actually just started one yesterday for a two-week period, and so that will help a little bit this quarter as we are opening 13 or whatever number of new units, as we are opening a couple more international ones. So, all those things, when we look at, one of the questions we have been asked in the last couple of quarters was membership, new membership growth has slowed a little bit. When you look at existing warehouses net of cannibalization take out all the cannibalized units that where new and the ones that those new ones cannibalize in those markets. We are still seeing a number in terms of member growth per warehouse in the high threes, mid-to-high threes I believe, 3.7, 3.8. I think it was 4 six months ago. That certainly gives us comfort and we feel it should give you. In terms of executive, I think on a weekly basis forever it seemed like it was like 20,000 a week, 22,000 a week, I think there are a couple of quarters where it was in the mid-teens or maybe in the low double digits. So, it has come back from that to 2019. In terms of, some of that is ultimately you do saturate a little bit, but part of it also, in terms of new countries, we currently operate in U.S., Canada, UK and Mexico, and I think if you just looked at simply how many units we have in each of those markets, certainly Mexico and U.S. is not an issue. We are in the low-to-mid-30s in the UK, and in low-to-mid-30s in the Mexico. And part of that is you need kind of a critical base because of the services that you offer that also is not just a 2% reward, it is the services you offer for it. I would guess that you will see in other countries, and that will help a little bit in terms of driving that, but probably more will come from us driving the value of it. We have seen some improvement when people realized that, if I sign up for the Executive Member Card and I sign up for the co-brand Citi Visa Card that\u2019s not only the 2% from Costco, but the 2% from \u2013 on the average or whatever it is from Citi Visa and if I buy a TV that way it is a four-year warranty not a two-year warranty. So, all those things get people, the card business, I mean last year we represented over 0.5 million new car sales and if you were an executive member in some of those marketing items, you got a cash card that was a few hundred dollars more than if you were a Gold Star member. Rest assured that there were people that converted for that reason and once they did, they start to look at the other benefits of it. So, all those things help. We do a better job when you sign up of getting you to sign up as an executive as best as we can. Peter Benedict : Okay. Thanks, so much Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is open. Kate McShane : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I know this has been asked a couple of times, but I just want to ask it maybe in a little bit different way, but with the level of cash that have come in from the membership increases and in the tax reform, do you think your price investment is going to result in greater gap historically, given the amounts that you've been able to invest? Richard Galanti : I think, they have. I mean, on a general picture, if you look at just the traditional grocery industry, there's more competition generally out there and have others come down in certain pricing, I think, a little. Have we come down more, yes. This is an old statistic, but I remember looking at traditional grocery markups and recognizing there's been some product additions that are higher-margin items, especially items of supermarket industry over time. But over 20 years, this goes back a few years ago, so five years ago and 25 years ago or whatever, it seemed like generally speaking, the grocery industry was going from markups that had been in the very high teens or low-20s to the mid and high-20s. And the big home improvement companies had gone from the high-20s to the mid-30s in what is our gross margin and our markup has done, it has gone up from 10 to 12. And in fact, it has gone up from 10 to 12, despite the fact \u2013 and some of that is not quite right. Some of that is some higher-margin businesses like travel, which has very little cost of sales, or some of the ancillary businesses like pharmacy and optical that have very little cost of sales. So relatively speaking. Cost of sales got higher markup to cover the cost of pharmacists and optometrists or what have you. So, I think, with all said and done, in our view, just looking at the pricing gap, we've done stronger. And I think we get a little more kick out of a dollar used in certain ways than perhaps others that we're fortunate in that regard. Kate McShane : Okay, great. Thanks. And my second question was just on the international business. I wondered if you could remind us of the timeline or your expectation for profitability for France, the newer stores in France and Spain to be profitable? Richard Galanti : Yes. I think at the store level in Spain, we\u2019re there \u2013 we\u2019re pretty much there or very close. And mind you, we charge, we own many of these locations around the world. We own 80% - around 80% of our locations. We charge a higher than current market rent factor internally just to have everything and look at all warehouses on the same schedule and I\u2019m talking about after that imputed rent factor as well. But on a store contribution level, yes. France is brand-new. Iceland is a unique brand-new in the last couple of years. Iceland is unique, because it's just been a great market for us. So, it's done better than planned. The others are pretty much of an implant. We \u2013 if I go back, again, number of years ago, our original budget in Japan is 20 years ago was open five units and five years and we break-even or start profitability towards the end of your five or early six. We ended up opening six, and I think we were profitable near the end of \u2013 right before the end of year four. These are rough numbers. But at the end of the day that includes the cost of a central operation that's not going to grow as you go from two units to 10 units in a market, it's going to grow a lot less than five-fold. And the pre-opening cost of a new unit and then the fact that you're also building your business. We start with a slow volume building as expected in some new countries, not all new countries. You\u2019re pricing your fresh foods as if you're doing a lot more business and you know, you're going to have some cases very low or negative gross margin sometimes of those. So, I think the timeline we're patient. We're also not going into any market and trying to get 10 or 20 openings in one year or two years. And so, it's \u2013 I think, we've done a decent job of balancing that process. Kate McShane : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Binder with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Binder : Thanks. I\u2019m Dan Binder. I had a couple of questions. First was on\u2026 Operator : Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Binder : Can you hear me? Richard Galanti : Yes, I can hear you. Dan Binder : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Richard Galanti : Hey, Josh? Can you hear me, Josh? Josh? Operator : Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Richard Galanti : Josh? Chuck Cerankosky : Richard, I can hear you. Well, this is Chuck Cerankosky. Operator : Our next question comes from Laura Champine from Loop Capital. Your line is now open. Richard Galanti : Somebody, call him. Hold on, we\u2019re having problem with some third-party here. But Chuck why don\u2019t you go because my guess is everybody else could hear us. Laura Champine : I\u2019m not sure he is on. It is Laura Champine, which one of us can you hear? Richard Galanti : I can hear Laura now. So, we\u2019re going to \u2013 [indiscernible]. Operator : \u2026Kelly Bania with BMO Capital [indiscernible]. Your line is open. Richard Galanti : Okay, guys, hold on a second. I am just calling him. Just hold on a second. Operator : Bania, your line is open. Kelly Bania : Hi, Richard, it\u2019s Kelly. Can you hear me? Should I go ahead or do you want to\u2026 Richard Galanti : I would wait, because I don\u2019t think Josh can hear you. Kelly Bania : So, no problem. Sorry, I can hear you. Richard Galanti : I think Dan Binder was the first one that did not - Dan Binder is the first one that you couldn\u2019t hear, but we could hear. So, can we go back to him. Operator : So, you just have to get them to requeue up and I\u2019ll promote them again. Richard Galanti : Okay. Thank you. So, go ahead. Operator : You\u2019re welcome. Richard Galanti : Put I back to you, Josh. Who\u2019s next? Operator : I\u2019m sorry, this is Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Richard Galanti : Okay. Kelly Bania : Okay, thanks. Thanks, Richard. Just wanted to first ask on quickly on gas, did you clarify the impact from just the mix of higher gas prices versus the actual gas margins? Richard Galanti : We didn\u2019t \u2013 margins in terms of dollars, margins were down and we made it up in volume. And so, profitability was pretty even year-over-year. Kelly Bania : Got it. Okay. And then just also wanted to go back to the comments on the food and sundries, inflation \u2013 the cost inflation, I guess that\u2019s way driven. Are you seeing any acceleration in that? Are you not quite passing all that \u2013 all of that along? Do you see your competitors passing along? Do you see that kind of accelerating as more of these vendors that maybe our feeling or starting to push that through? Richard Galanti : Well, I think, a general comment would be as is, what \u2013 whatever input \u2013 cost input item is inflationary we\u2019re going to hold off longer than others, but ultimately, you\u2019ve got to do it. And we like any other retailer would push back to the vendor and try to figure out smarter ways to do things. And \u2013 but overall, I \u2013 it\u2019s a small delay. Don't \u2013 we're noble, but we're not crazy, so. Kelly Bania : I guess, do you think \u2013 I mean, do you think this could result in some just broader food inflation over the next several quarters? That was just we haven't seen in the long time. Richard Galanti : I think you\u2019ll see that generally. I mean, if costs are up 2% to 3% input cost on the food and sundries side, a big chunk of that is freight related. Ultimately, that's going to compel. Now some of that will also compel to private label in some cases. In our case, we generally see this as a positive because we can be a little tougher on pricing in terms of being \u2013 and being more competitive. Kelly Bania : Got it. And then just one more on the online grocery, the non-perishable's offering. Richard Galanti : Hold on. [Indiscernible] Josh? Operator : Yes. Richard Galanti : We had a couple of calls externally here that people in our office that are \u2013 they cannot here the call all of a sudden, so while we continue here, can you check, see what's going on there? Operator : Certainly, not a problem, I\u2019ll look into that for you. Richard Galanti : Okay. Thank you. Go ahead, I\u2019m sorry. Kelly Bania : Okay. I\u2019ll ask one more, maybe while others are getting back in queue. Just on the non-perishable's offering, how do you feel about the process of fulfilling those and scaling that over time? Do you think you need anymore \u2013 any sort of automation technology to fulfill those orders and make that profitable longer-term, or are you happy with the way that process is working? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, this stuff is profitable. It's small, it's growing nicely. But it's \u2013 we have capacity within our business centers, which we already set up to do buy online and actually deliver this way. It's just you had to buy some box-making machinery. And the good news for us is that, we feel that, A, there yes. Ultimately, God willing, we'll have to build new facilities or additional facilities for this. Just like when we started, we had one e-commerce fulfillment facility in Mira Loma that covered the whole country years ago. And so, yes, there\u2019s a trade off. But I think that, A, we feel very good about how we\u2019re doing it that we can be profitable almost from the start other than things we\u2019re doing to invest and driving the business and marketing it and things, and it will be fine. Again, I think, we\u2019re fortunate in that regard with so few items, it\u2019s lot easier to do these things. Kelly Bania : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Binder with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Binder : Hi, it\u2019s Dan Binder. Thanks. Thanks, because if you are getting me back in the queue there. I had two questions. First was on the benefit that you\u2019re seeing in clubs where you've had competitor closings. Obviously, there were a lot. So I\u2019m just curious what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the comps benefit and the membership benefit? And then my second question was around price investment, a little bit different angle. Just trying to understand more about couponing versus everyday low price. I think, it was probably a year or so, maybe a little over year ago, where you had backed off, I think, on the vendor items a little bit that hurt the comps and then you kind of brought it back. I\u2019m just curious as you think about price investment going forward, will it be more through the vendor mailer or more through EDLP? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, if we go back to \u2013 just to clarify one thing. If we go back to \u2013 it was Q2 of last year when there was a little disappointing and a lot of it had to do with is the stuff that we did to change the MVM and take some items and test with vendors everyday low pricing or \u2013 and some greater values, but still be at the table in the MVM, maybe a few hot picks as well. And more of the offset to that that we didn\u2019t anticipate on a negative standpoint was fewer MVM days. So, if you went down, I think, it was the four week reporting month of February of 2017, 28 days. We had eight less MVM days. The MVM items themselves did as expected more lift, more value to the member and less gross margin per item, but more gross margins dollars to us. So that work nice. But by having those significantly fewer days of having something that is a promotional thing that gets member in the door and we change that. It took us two months to change that and since then it\u2019s been fine and, of course, it's gotten better than that since then. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any magic. If there were an exact formula that we knew, we would tell anybody. But at the end of the day, we keep trying different things with different vendors and see what works and doesn\u2019t. I think, we have kind of settled on a mix that it includes all of the above and we\u2019ll keep them trying to figure out how to drive that in different ways. So again, I don\u2019t see there\u2019s a big shift. The shift was over a couple of years perhaps leading up to a February of 2018 or the late calendar 2016, there was over 20 years some of the stuff gets \u2013 some of the sales lifts of an item gets a less people waiting for that regular thing every twice a year for three weeks waiting. And so, a, the values have to be greater to drive more lift and, b, we got to shake it up a little bit. And I think it\u2019s \u2013 the good news is work with vendors. We\u2019re not just forcing vendors to try something, try one thing versus another. We\u2019re working with our vendors hopefully that do well for both of us and even partner with them when there's a little indigestion on how much additional savings. And so we can show them the type of unit lift that will be \u2013 that will generate and sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn\u2019t [Technical Difficulty] were a couple or three Sam's closing in the existing Sam's market. So they were just adding a lot of those sales to other units they already had. Our view was as we get 10% to 20% of it and we have of what we guess their sales would be. Some of it is not our member. Some of it is \u2013 we're too far away from that member, maybe that was on the other \u2013 it was 10 miles from the other side of the existing Sam's Club and we\u2019re 10 miles, the other way is now 20 miles just too far. In some cases, the business went to another existing Sam's in the market. We definitely saw some benefit in the membership, number of members. Again, not huge, but certainly helps and\u2026 Dan Binder : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Chuck Cerankosky : Hi, Richard. Going on a little update on the food manufacturing projects you have underway. The construction, where is that at? And then I want to ask another question about the online. Richard Galanti : I\u2019m sorry, ask that first question again? Chuck Cerankosky : You\u2019ve got a couple of food plants under construction, where are we at on those and in the special opening days? Richard Galanti : Well, the bakery commissary in Canada is open and running. I would say, it will take a year plus to get it to increase capacity and everything. But that's going as planned. Our chicken plant in Nebraska is a year-and-a-half away, a year plus, it's under construction. But it\u2019s all planned on a relative term in terms of we know it's going to take a year plus to get there, but it\u2019s doing fine. Anything else, guys? Unidentified Company Representative : [Indiscernible] Richard Galanti : We opened outside of Chicago in March, Illinois, a second meat plant, basically a sister plant, if you will, in the one in Tracy, California that we had forever. And the good news there is the Tracy one along with the added capacity at the hotdog plant at the same property location were at capacity basically and we pushed that over. Chuck Cerankosky : Okay. You mentioned before you had 10,000 SKUs online. Is that the count all the time? And then when you look at how you remerchandise the online assortment over the course of the year? How often are you changing that? It seems like the e-mail and promotional activities picked up. But what is the cadence to refresh the mix in assortment that you have? Richard Galanti : Well, look, I think, A, it's not unlike in warehouse. The exception is, of course, online. We want to be a little resistant to just climbing, because it's virtually easy, because it still has cost. We've added velocity items. We've added sundries and some shelf-stable items to delivery, that's another avenue as well. I think, it will ebb and flow. Don't expect any great change to what you're seeing now other than a constant evolution of that. The other thing is, in some cases, there\u2019s products and vendors that will sell us online that weren't prepared to sell certain things in store. And sometimes, you'll have to be a member to get to the price online at Costco, which is fine. Our member understands that and they\u2019re going to to and see it. Chuck Cerankosky : All right. Thank you. Richard Galanti : I\u2019m going to take two more questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Laura Champine with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Laura Champine : Great. Thanks for taking my question. On the private label business, I mean, obviously, a lot of clubs have been streamlining the number of brands they offer. Kirkland has used almost throughout Costco. But there are some other brands like the Charisma and some of the textiles. Why not go for Kirkland across the Board? And do you have goals on how much of your sales you\u2019d like to drive through that private label brand? Richard Galanti : Unfortunately, our head merchant is traveling to an opening today in California or is that an opening day in California. I\u2019m not sure and in my mind, Kirkland Signature is it to the extent there's a brand called Charisma, but it's not our brand. I know it\u2019s not \u2013 the way it\u2019s not our brand. Now maybe it\u2019s a brand it\u2019s not as well noticed as others, but that\u2019s not our brand. Kirkland Signature is the only brand you can see in Costco. Laura Champine : Got it. Richard Galanti : As it relates to how much, what I guess it\u2019s Kirkland Signature label but excluding that, which is 10%-plus of our sales. It\u2019s about 25% - 24% plus of our sales, where we wanted to go, I don\u2019t know where we wanted to go. We\u2019ll increase, yes. Years ago, I said, well, you\u2019ll never see it on this and then now it\u2019s on that. But at the end of the day, we still want brands and we still cover it and our members certainly value brands as well. In our view, it enhances our brand value. But there\u2019s a 24, it keeps increasing to the 25 and 26, and 27, I\u2019m sure it will, but I can't tell you how long that will take. Laura Champine : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. David Bellinger : Hey, Richard it\u2019s David Bellinger on. Just a couple of quick questions. Can you talk about regional performance in the quarter? Any weather impact on traffics that you can call out specifically? Was there any improvement towards the end of the quarter? Richard Galanti : There weren\u2019t a lot of weather related comments eventually hold on we're still looking, real quick. It really wasn't that impactful to us. David Bellinger : Okay and I\u2019ll just follow-up on margins as well. It seems that the major drag came from the higher gas prices this quarter. But can you help us frame what percentage of sales gas represented this quarter, I know you just mentioned was on annual basis like above 10%. If you want to get too specific can you just give us some indication how that\u2019s changed over the past few quarters and how that impacted here in Q3? Richard Galanti : Yes, we really don\u2019t go into that level of detail. Generally speaking with gas prices go up we will make a little less margin, when they go down we make more margin, happy that they went down yesterday a little bit. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s been a good business for us in its own right as well as driving business into our warehouses. It's about 10% to 12% of our business. And I think that the thing that we like to see is, when you have total U.S. gallon gas consumption as a country everywhere be up in the very, very low single digits, our gallon increases are in the very, very high single digits or very, very low double-digits. And so that\u2019s meaningful that means that more people are coming into our place and with about half of them come into shop, you don\u2019t need more than one or two of those 50 out of every 100 to be somewhere, but incremental shop to be meaningful to our company on an ongoing basis. Aside from the business itself having a little strong [indiscernible] based on the volatility sometime day-to-day and week-to-week, but profitably, but overall it\u2019s been a good business in its own right. David Bellinger : That\u2019s helpful, thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. Richard Galanti : Thank you. We\u2019re all around guys and feel free to call with any additional questions, we\u2019ll be here tomorrow as well. Thank you. Operator : This conclude today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to this Q4 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Richard Galanti. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Britney, and good afternoon to everyone. I\u2019ll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the Company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today\u2019s press release, we reported our operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and the 16 weeks ended September 2nd. Net income for the quarter came in at $1,043 million or $2.36 per share, a 13.5% increase compared to the $909 million or $2.08 per share in the 17-week fourth quarter last year. If you normalize the number of weeks, it\u2019s about a 20% increase. In terms of sales. Net sales for the quarter came in at $43.4 billion, a 5% increase over the $41.4 billion last year, again 16 versus 17 weeks. On a comp basis which is on a like-week basis, comps were up 9.5% for the quarter. Sales for the 52-week fiscal year 2018, they increased 9.7% to 138.4 billion from $126.2 billion last year and the 53-week year; on a comp basis for the year as well, we reported a 9.5% comp. Now, comp sales for the fourth quarter were as follows, and again from the press release. In the U.S. on a reported basis, was 10.8%; ex gas and FX, it would have been a 7.8. Canada, reported was a 5.7% for the 16 weeks; on a ex gas and FX was 4.6%. And other international 6.7% reported, a 6.9% ex gas and inflation -- gas inflation and FX. All told, total Company, as I mentioned, reported a 9.5%, ex gas and FX was 7.2%. As well e-commerce, which we have started reporting about a year ago on a monthly basis as well, e-commerce for the 16 weeks was a 26.2% comp, and ex gas and FX 26.3%. In terms of Q4 sales metrics. Fourth quarter traffic or shopping frequency was up 4.9%, both on a worldwide basis as well as in the U.S. Weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by about 25 basis points and gas inflation benefited Q4 comps by about 260 basis points. Cannibalization by the way weighed on the comp by about 55 basis points negative. Our average frontend transaction was up 4.4% during Q4; and excluding the impacts of inflation and FX, our average ticket was up a little over 2%. Next on the income statement line, membership income. We reported $997 million or 2.30% of membership fee income in Q4 of \u201818; last year in the 17-week quarter, it was $943 million, 2 basis points lower. So, about 54 -- on a reported basis, $54 million increase or up 5.7%, again on a like weeks basis up a little over 12%. Of this normalized 12% number increase year-over-year in Q4, a little over half related to membership fee increases, the majority of which came from the $5 and $10 annual fee increases taken last June 1st in the U.S. and Canada. In terms of membership renewal rates. Renewal rates rose in Q4. In our U.S. and Canada membership renewal rate at Q4-end stood at 90.4%. That\u2019s up from 90.1% at Q3-end 16 weeks earlier; and our worldwide rate improved from 87.9% -- improved to 87.9%, up from 87.5% at Q3-end. In terms of number of members at Q4-end. At Q4-end, we had 40.7 million Gold Star households that\u2019s up from 16 weeks earlier 40.0 million; primary business 7.6 million, up from 7.5 million; business add-ons stood at 3.3 million, both at Q3-end and Q4-end. So, all told, we went from 50.9 million member households quarter ago end to 51.6 million at Q4-end. In terms of cardholders, we ended the year with 94.3 million cardholders, up from 93.0 million at Q3-end. During the quarter, we had 13 net new openings. Also at Q4-end, paid executive memberships stood at 19.3 million that\u2019s an increase of 229,000 exec members during the 16 weeks or about 14,000 increase per week, which by the way is the same average for the whole year. Related to the annual fee increases. The year-over-year quarterly fee income benefit peaked in this quarter, the fourth quarter. It will continue to be added to our numbers during the upcoming fourth quarters, very little in Q4 of \u201819, but during the four quarters, but will moderate each quarter. And this is due to the nature of deferred accounting treatment of the fee increases. Going down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was lower year-over-year by 35 basis points, coming in at 10.92%, down from 11.27%. And that 35 basis-point negative, excluding gas inflation was minus 9 basis points. As I always ask you to do, go down two columns of numbers, one is Q4 \u201818 reported; and then, Q4 \u201818, ex gas inflation. The first line item would be core merchandise. On a year-over-year basis, on a reported basis, core merchandise was margin was down 44 basis points year-over-year, ex-gas inflation was down 22. Ancillary businesses were plus 14 reported and plus 21 ex-gas inflation; 2% reward plus 1 and minus 2 basis points. Other was minus 6 and minus 6 basis points year-over-year. If you add those two columns up, you\u2019ll get the 35 basis-point negative, which we reported and then minus 9 basis-point, which I just mentioned on an ex-gas inflation basis. Now, the core merchandise component, again on reported basis was lower by 44 and lower by 22 ex-gas inflation; that still takes into account the sales penetration of the different categories. If you look at the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales, core merchandise margin categories in terms of their own sales core on core, if you will, margins year-over-year in Q4 were lower by 2 basis points. Within the food and sundries and hardlines was up a little, softlines and fresh were down little. But all told, it was minus 2 on core on core. Ancillary and other business gross margin, as I mentioned, was up 14 reported and up 21, ex-gas inflation. That\u2019s because of the extra good margins as well as the sales penetration. Other was minus 6, as was the case in the first three quarters of fiscal \u201818. I\u2019ve mentioned to you that we\u2019re incurring some incremental costs, primarily related to the rollout of the centralized return facilities throughout the country. And during the quarter, that was a 4 basis-point detriment, which is relatively speaking, an improvement from the first three quarters. In addition, we\u2019re cycling some one-time items that last year and the quarter -- which net-net benefited last year\u2019s quarter by two basis points with some positive legal settlement offset by some impact from last year\u2019s Hurricane Harvey. Moving to SG&A. Our SG&A percentage was lower or better by 15 basis points; and on ex-gas inflation and FX, it was worse by 8 basis points, coming in at 9.82 of sales this year; that would be the 15 basis points lower than the 9.97 on a reported basis. Again, for ease of explanation, we\u2019ll jot down two columns of numbers, Q4 \u201818 as reported and then Q4 \u201818, ex-gas inflation. Core operations is the first one, lower by 16, and I will say plus 16 basis points and minus 4 basis points or worse by 4 basis points on ex-gas inflation basis; central minus 4 and minus 7; stock compensation zero and zero; and other was a benefit, plus 3 and plus 3. Again, you add up the columns, you get on a reported basis, we were lower or better by 15 basis points and ex gas inflation, higher or worse by 8 basis points. Now, the core operation component, I\u2019d say, the U.S. wage increase that went into effect in June 11th to our hourly employees in the U.S., that negatively impacted SG&A by 6 basis points. And as I mentioned probably last quarter, this will continue to impact the SG&A comparison over the next three quarters, so June 11 through June 10th of next year.  Central expense was higher year-over-year in Q4 by 4 basis points, 7 ex gas inflation, IT expenses were 2 basis points of that, and the balance coming from a lot of small changes in a variety of miscellaneous items frankly. But, net-net, it added up to minus 7 ex gas. And lastly, other was better by 3; that related to expenses incurred last year on the SG&A line as well from the Hurricane Harvey. Next, on the income statement, preopening expense. About the same year-over-year. This year, it came in at $31 million; last year, it was $30 million, so $1 million higher. Last year in the quarter, in Q4 we opened 15 openings, 13 net, plus a couple of relos. This year, we had 12 openings, 8 in the U.S. and Canada, and 4 international. All told, reported operating income for the 16-week Q4 of \u201818 came in at $1,446 million; this compares to a $1,450 million in the 17 weeks results of last year in the fourth quarter. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was $5 million lower year-over-year, coming at $48 million this in Q4 compared to $53 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher year-over-year by $29 million. Interest income itself was higher by $11 million, despite one less week year-over-year, a combination of higher interest rates earned on the cash proceeds, cash we have, as well as higher invested cash balances. Also benefitting the year-over-year comparison were positive year-over-year FX items that in total amounted to $14 million. Overall, pretax income was higher by 2% or $30 million in this year\u2019s 16-week quarter, coming in at $1,449 million this year versus last year\u2019s 17 weeks results of $1,419 million.  In terms of income taxes. Our tax rate in Q4 \u201818 came in at 27.4% and 28.4% for all of fiscal \u201818. This compared to 27.4% for Q4 compared to last year\u2019s Q4 of 34.3%. This quarter\u2019s tax rate benefitted of course from the income tax reform that was effective January 1st as well as the favorable discrete tax adjustments. For fiscal \u201819, based on our current estimates, which of course are subject to change, we anticipate our effective total Company tax rate to be approximately 28%. A few other items of note. During -- in all fiscal \u201818, we opened a net of 21 new units, plus additional -- 4 additional relos. Of the 21 net, 13 were in the United States and 8 were international. For \u201819, we expect to open 20 plus, in the low-20s net new warehouses. About 3 quarters will be in United States and about a quarter international. As well, we plan to relocate 4 units to better located and larger facilities, same number as we did this year. We\u2019re also under construction with our first Costco in China in Shanghai with the opening expected late next September. As of Q4 end, total warehouse square footage stood right at 110 million square feet. And next subject, stock buybacks. In Q4, we repurchased $89 million worth of Costco stock or 419,000 shares at an average price of $211.35. For all of 2018, we repurchased $322 million at an average price of 183.13 per share. Moving to e-commerce activities. Overall e-commerce sales increase has continued at strong levels for the quarter, coming in at 26.2% and for the year, 32.2%. First and foremost, we continue to deliver great values for our members as well we continue improving and slightly expanding our offerings, including some new brands and higher end brands. We continue to improve the member experience as well. This past fiscal year, our site traffic conversion rates and orders, all improved year-over-year. Online grocery, both our dry grocery as well as our -- our dry grocery two-day delivery as well as our same-day fresh delivery, the latter through Instacart and others like Shipt are growing nicely, but still a very small part of our Company\u2019s sales. In terms of online two-day grocery, which is the right side, we\u2019re generating sales in all 50 states including the 6 states where no physical Costcos are present, still relatively small to our Company. We continue to improve the online merchandise and sales offerings and services offerings with Hot Buys and Buyer Picks, and buy online and pickup in store. And we\u2019ll continue to do exciting merchandising activities. Overall, all these efforts we feel are positively impacting our business, both online and in warehouse and are helping our sales increasing member awareness of our digital presence, as well as increased traffic that we\u2019ve enjoyed in our warehouses. The next subject I\u2019ll touch on is tariffs and their impact on our business. As you know, there are many moving parts and it\u2019s extremely fluid, starting with the actions and reactions by both the U.S. and Chinese governments. What actions are we exploring and taking in some short term and some long term? Accelerating shipments before tariffs go into effect; recognizing there\u2019s a limited ability to do so, everybody\u2019s trying to. Working with suppliers to see what can be done to reduce and/or absorb some of the costs. In some cases, reducing our commitments on certain impacted items. Alternative country sourcing, sure, but again, it\u2019s where possible and feasible; it\u2019s limited ability that takes time. Five, taking advantage of lower pricing on some U.S. items because of the reverse, if you will, such as pork, nuts and soybeans. In summary, we\u2019ll have to see how customers and competitors react to tariffs and what impacts it will have remain to be seen. Last topic, as was noted in this afternoon\u2019s press release. We plan to report in our Form 10-K a material weakness in internal control related to general IT controls. These controls relate to internal user access and program change management over certain of our IT systems that relate to our financial reporting processes. I can tell you that there have been no misstatements identified in the financial statements as a result of the deficiencies, and we expect to timely file our Form 10-K. In terms of remediation. Remediation efforts have begun. But material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we conclude through testing that controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of the material weakness will be completed prior to the end of fiscal 2019. Lastly, in terms of upcoming releases. We will announce our September sales results for the 5 weeks adding the Sunday, October 7th, next week on October 10th. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Britney for Q&A. Thank you, Britney. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And at this time, we have a question from Michael Lasser. Q - Michael Lasser : Good evening, Richard. Thanks a lot for taking my question. With the core gross margin down 2 basis points, the expectation was that you\u2019d be taking some of the tax reform and investing it in the value proposition, particularly price. So, have those investments been made? And if they have, has it just been [technical difficulty] in areas? And where do you think your pricing now currently stands with others in the marketplace that have been investing in price? Richard Galanti : Well, keep in mind, we invest in price as it\u2019s in our DNA. Certainly, over the last few years, there\u2019s been several buckets, if you will, that we\u2019ve talked about, starting with the credit card transition that afforded us some great savings, some of which we used to invest in price, if you will; next was the what\u2019s occurred generally every five or six years, a fee increase in June of \u201817; and then, of course, the tax reform. And all those things I think have afforded us the ability. So, I don\u2019t know -- it\u2019s not like this one thing, but these monies are fungible. And we are not only investing in price, we\u2019re investing in infrastructure that we would have done anyway, remind you, with the initial successes of two-day and one-day fresh. So, there is a lot going on. And in terms of how we feel competitively, I can tell you, every four weeks when we meet for our daily budget meeting in each of -- the U.S. as an example, each of the -- all regions, including foreign regions, but in the U.S., the eight geographic regions, they do price shops compared to our direct competitors, and we feel very good about those where we stand competitively. As it relates to monies that traditional retailers, whether it\u2019s supermarkets or the other big boxes, look, it works and it helps. But we think it impacts other traditional retailers a lot more than it does to us. I think that we\u2019ve seen as evidenced by our strong traffic numbers and frankly our strong comps in store, we feel pretty good about where we stand on that. Michael Lasser : You\u2019ve been accelerating your e-commerce growth and it\u2019s growing at a very nice clip. So, would you consider further doubling down on some of your e-commerce investments in light of the fact that you\u2019ve been able to show growth through both channels? Richard Galanti : Well, doubling down, I guess there\u2019s going be lots of definitions of doubling down. I think, we are; I mean, we certainly are putting a lot of focus on. And I can tell you, within IT, we\u2019ve got a lot of efforts going into fulfillment and sourcing and you name it. But, I think part of our long-term natured DNA is that we\u2019re going to do what we feel comfortable doing and grow it nicely. We\u2019ve got a lot of activities in that area. We\u2019ve added brands; we\u2019ve added some categories. But for us, doubling or tripling 3,000 or 4,000 SKUs to 8,000 or 9,000 is a lot for us. But, there are plenty of opportunities that we\u2019re seeing, not only on adding products but the way we do it. We feel that the one and two-day delivery options that we now offer at frankly better prices and our items were being offered by other third parties before, dramatically better pricing, should help us, should help that process. We\u2019re finding the ability to benefit not only with e-commerce but using online and emails to drive traffic into the warehouse, again with Hot Buys and perhaps in some cases some targeted buys, and online and e-commerce to be able to sell some items that were seasonally in nature that we might only have for 8, 10, 12 weeks, notably, patio furniture and lawn and garden or furniture during the summer. But patio lawn and garden, we generally were in and out of that stuff for 10, 12 weeks. Now, we\u2019re in 52 weeks online and there are some real sales to be had there. So, part of it\u2019s on us to keep that awareness going and improving that awareness. I think we\u2019re doing a better job of it, but we have more to do there. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman. Josh Kamboj : Hi. This is Josh Kamboj on for Simeon Gutman. Thanks for taking our question. Your comps have been very strong for the last few quarters. If you look at the basket that consumers are buying, would you attribute the strength more to capturing a broader set of categories, or are customers trading up within your core consumable categories? And if the former, which new categories are you seeing the most success in? Richard Galanti : It\u2019s really pretty balanced, I think not only for us but other non-food retailers like Walmart, and Target and certainly Best Buy. Electronics has been strong, and there are some higher price points there in general. Apparel has been helpful to us. So, we\u2019ve had some continued strong results for several years now in apparel, both brand and Kirkland Signature. And we keep trying to put another can in that package. So, I think all those things help. But, it\u2019s more -- I\u2019d say, it\u2019s more broad based than specific. Josh Kamboj : And then, just as a quick follow-up, looking at consumer health through your lens now. Gas prices had leveled off for a while. They\u2019re beginning to rise again. Are you seeing greater sensitivity greater sensitivity in any of those categories? Richard Galanti : Well, we haven\u2019t yet, but again, every day is a new day. One thing -- we found that when gas prices were going down, some retailers were taking them down as much as they could have, in our view, which is fine with us. We could have gone down a little more, but still were able to make a little. So, that\u2019s helped us and enhanced that value proposition. Generally, when prices go up, same thing, we generally can find where people are more conscious. I know -- I remember, back in the first part of calendar \u201808, when the economy was on fire and gas prices were north of $4 and some were saying it\u2019s going to go to north $5, we saw a big increase in comp gallons. Same thing we\u2019re seeing in the last couple of years; we\u2019ve seen -- we\u2019ve enjoyed a big increase in comp gallons because of that value proposition. It\u2019s hard to say how that impacts our numbers. Our numbers are fortunately pretty good. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom. Chuck Grom : Richard, just first question is on the ancillary part of the gross profit margin composition that you provided. Just wondering why the ancillary line was up 14 basis points, so it\u2019s a big reversal from the third quarter. Richard Galanti : Well, the big thing is gas. Gas is now low double digit percent of our total sales on a price point that\u2019s 20-plus-percent higher per gallon than a year ago. And while it\u2019s a low-margin business relative to us, the Company, its margins had improved year-over-year. So, on that penetration, that helped us. E-com helped us a little as well. Chuck Grom : So, e-com has sort of captured in that line item, okay. And then, the second question is, I know you guys have talked about -- you talked about sort of store targets in the low 30s; now, you\u2019re talking low 20s. Just wondering why that deceleration in number of openings planned for 2019? Richard Galanti : Well, we have a budget that\u2019s -- it\u2019s between 20 and 25. So, I come in at the low 20s, just to be conservative. We\u2019ve got more on plate. If you look at this year, this coming year, it\u2019s like three quarters one quarter U.S. There\u2019s more in the pipeline now internationally, but that pipeline takes longer to get through; it\u2019s longer pipeline. And so, I think you\u2019ll see that change, best guess, in 2020 and 2021. If I was a betting person, over the next five years beyond \u201819, probably some number in the mid-20s is a likely number, but we\u2019ll have to see; that\u2019s subject to change. Chuck Grom : Okay. And then, just a last question on e-commerce. What do you think about the impact from consumers buying online? Have you seen any change and how their shopping in store? In other words, are they coming less frequently to the store? And I don\u2019t think you are too concerned about, but if you could just kind of flush out maybe the entire basket for and trends for total household when you blend in the store trips along with the online buying habits. Richard Galanti : Well, I mean, the fact that traffic is actually as strong as it\u2019s ever been, we enjoy like a 4.2 [ph] average compounded annual traffic increase for seven years from \u201809 to \u201815. And I know everybody was concerned -- you guys, everybody was concerned when it got down to the low 3s and we\u2019ve enjoyed it back in the 4s now and 4.95 the last couple of months I believe. And so, it\u2019s hard to say, should have been higher than that if e-commerce. We think it\u2019s been a net additive, but it\u2019s hard to say at this point. Operator : And next we have a question from John Heinbockel. John Heinbockel : So, Rich, let me start with the difference between the minus 22 margin ex deflation, and the minus 2 in their own category. So, obviously adverse mix; I think that\u2019s maybe picked up a little bit the last six months. What\u2019s the primary driver of that? Is that mostly the strength in electronics or are there other factors that work? Richard Galanti : It\u2019s not mix, no. Electronics margins are generally where they\u2019ve been; there is not a big issue there. It\u2019s gas. You\u2019ve got a business that\u2019s -- what percentage of gas is our business now, 12%, 13%? 12% of our total Company sales is gas on a much different margin structure. John Heinbockel : Yes. But, I think, when you pull out the -- so, ex gas deflation, right, I think, margins were down 22, but there were down only 2, right, when looked at in their own categories, but the difference between the two is not mix driven? Richard Galanti : Well, it may be mix driven somewhat but keep in mind, there is lots of other things that go into margin. There is ancillary businesses that have high margins -- if you think about pharmacy and optical, their gross margin, which is sales minus cost of sales is a higher gross margin than the 40 to 50 we talked about, because it includes special optometrists and pharmacists. So, it\u2019s kind of like what is the price that customer is buying it all in that. And you\u2019ve got other categories that have -- ancillary categories or services that have higher margins. So, all those things go into the mix. John Heinbockel : But you\u2019re seeing penetration of KS continue to rise, and is it rising same as it had been, faster or slower? Richard Galanti : I think it\u2019s been consistently rising, not faster or slower. Keep in mind, there is still new items out there. But, you\u2019ve got a lot of items that start out at 10 and 20, and 30 million. The big items, like toilet paper and water. Yet, we saw a big growth over the last couple of years in water as -- where we brought the price down from $3.49 to $2.99. And just looking down the list of late, the Kirkland Signature 40 cartridge razor blades with a handle, several -- the organic cheeseburger in the food court, fragrances, the KS fragrances, all kinds of beverages. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then, just separate topic. You obviously were doing some stuff with BOPUS on a limited basis, and I think you wanted to keep it limited. Is it still just applying to those items, right, the notebooks and the bags or is an idea of expanding that? Richard Galanti : Well, we\u2019ve talked -- in the past we\u2019ve talked -- we mentioned things like jewelry, some limited electronics items like tablets, small sized items as well as handbags, high-end handbags and things. We have expanded it to some additional electronics items. But, it\u2019s still -- we still want to do it our way. We think that these are areas where we\u2019ve been surprised that many people are buying it, because it\u2019s convenient and then, they are going to come by to shop. Not to suggest these are all incremental [ph] member shops, by no means. But while they are in there, are over half of them are not just picking up the item they\u2019re going into the shop. They frankly shop at a higher -- much higher average than the average shop. So, so far so good, and we will see. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Karen Short. Karen Short : Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to start with e-commerce for a second. Can you just give us an update on where e-commerce is as a percent of sales? And then, I wanted to see if you could give us a little color on how to think about the growth rate of e-commerce going forward? Richard Galanti : I\u2019m sorry. What\u2019s the last part of the question? Karen Short : How to think about the growth rate of e-commerce going forward? Richard Galanti : Well, I mean, the number is right around 5% of sales, I think a shade under -- I\u2019m sorry, a little over 4%. And, look, we\u2019re going to drive it as much as we can. I think, a few months ago when we went from a string of monthly 30 pluses to 23 or something, people were disappointed a little bit out there. We feel very good about it. I think, we\u2019ve shown the last couple of months, I can\u2019t say anything about September, that will be next week, but we\u2019ve seen the numbers that we feel -- look, we have the benefit of having not focused on a lot for many years and now taking advantage of that in a big way. And I mean, the example of some big ticket seasonal items like home furnishings and furniture one part of the year and adding 40 extra weeks of offerings if you will, offering online now, as well as what we\u2019ve done with white goods and the success there. In three years, we\u2019ve grown from $50 million to $500 million in white good sales, which has been helped of course by the brands willing to sell us good high-end stuff and our ability to sell it. Karen Short : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just in terms of the tariff commentary that you made. Any way to give some sense of what percent of product is imported from China today and where you can see that going in the next few years? Richard Galanti : It\u2019s really hard to -- no, we don\u2019t want to give out specifics. There have been some of the analysts out there that have done some estimates that are -- seem to be within the range, but it\u2019s fluid. But, the real answer is things can\u2019t change overnight. And what can change is demand for an item, if the price is set to go up 15% or 25%. But, we\u2019ve experienced not dissimilar things. I mean, in Mexico when you got bunch of U.S. sourced goods historically, when the peso to the dollar has changed dramatically from 3 to 8 to 10, and then from 10 to 14 and more recently, the last couple of years from 14 to 18 to 20 range that\u2019ll have a dampening effect on certain products until it has less of a dampening product -- impact. So, it\u2019s really too early to tell. Karen Short : Okay. And just last question. I guess, can you just give us inflation in 4Q, both cost and at retail, and then expectations, translation, given all the narrative from vendors base, since calling out passing on cost increases? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have that off the top my of head on a cost basis. And this is purely like looking at LIFO indices and not on sales, because some categories have a higher penetration. It\u2019s very small -- it\u2019s slightly inflationary. But I\u2019m talking about capital S in the word slightly. Karen Short : And then, what are your thoughts generally, because there has been a lot of narrative from the vendors in terms of passing on price increases? Where do you guys kind of stand or what are you seeing on that front? Richard Galanti : Well, I mean, our DNA is we want to be the last to raise the price and we want to work with any supplier to figure out how to not do that. But ultimately, you can\u2019t eat all these. But, we feel competitively, we\u2019ll keep doing what we do that we\u2019re usually the last to raise the price and the first to lower. And I think, we have, as a company one advantage is, is that we don\u2019t have to sell every brand alternative, every size alternative, and every SKU alternative on given item. And there are times when I think we -- our buying power is in effect -- the octane of that buying power is more than $138 billion of purchasing power. Because it\u2019s much number of limited items and not only brands competing, but also what we know about many of these items because of our private label nature. So, it affords us I think some opportunities that perhaps make it a little easier for us. But nothing\u2026 Karen Short : Thanks. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers. Christopher Horvers : So, first question is, you mentioned in the release that there have been no misstatements found related to the internal control weakness? What\u2019s-- is that the highness? Is there any risk that there could be a misstatement of the financials in the future or is that more about sort of just fixing the systems and getting the testing done? Richard Galanti : Well, keep in mind first of all that we feel comfortable and we feel that ultimately our auditors feel comfortable. We would have expressed a level of comfort we did in the press release about the time that there\u2019s no misstatements and there is the timeliness [ph] that will be filed on time including the K. The issues had to do with internal user access, so people within IT or contractors. And when somebody who may have had access to something they should have and sometimes that they -- once they should have had that access relieved, it took a little too long to do so. So, the controls weren\u2019t in place. We should have done a better job. We went back as far as we could and looked back as far as we could in some systems, for the entire fiscal year, which is what you want to do and some of the newer systems, there was no look back ability for certain things. I can tell you with all the look backs that we have done and then our outside help has done, has found no issues whatsoever in terms of misstatements or breaches. So, that\u2019s what we can tell you. But, we can\u2019t be more positive that until we release the 10-K. And so, I don\u2019t want to belittle it. We should have -- it should have been fixed it, but it\u2019s -- it was internal to us, not external and we\u2019ll go from there. Christopher Horvers : Can you also talk about sort of the -- like an organic MFI growth number, sort of ex-FX and the 53rd week? It looks like all-in that that number was running a little bit below 5% in the first half of the year, and then in the third quarter sort of picked up over 5%, and then in the fourth quarter nearly 6%. Is that sort of rough math that you\u2019re seeing sort of like a MFI comp accelerating\u2026 Richard Galanti : Well, that is -- that\u2019s pretty good rough math. But keep in mind, one of the issues is the deferred accounting. The U.S. and Canada $5 and $10 fee increases that went into effect June 1st of \u201817, so in effect, I believe that in total, it was $245 million. Well, in the next 12 months, using that number as the example, that\u2019s how much more we have in our checking account. Based on deferred accounting, it takes 23 months to get that into the P&L. And so, part of the increase from Q3 relative -- year-over-year Q3 relative to year-over-year Q4 is you peak in 12-month sense, if you think about it. Somebody who got a $10 increase for the first time, their renewal happen to be in June, that $10 was effectively $0.80 a month for 12 months, right June to May. Somebody who got it 11 months later in May, they paid it for the first time, 11 months after the first person did, that will hit the $0.80 a month for months 12 through 23, rough numbers. So, if you will, in month 12 is when you peak in terms of that -- getting what I\u2019ll call, the full effect of 1/12 of the 270 million -- 245 million as an example. So, I think a little of it probably has to do with that. I wouldn\u2019t suggest that what used to be a 4% increase became a 5% and there is no 6%, some of that increase is related to that. And some of it of course is related to how many openings we have and when the openings are where we open a very successful unit on these side of Seattle and Redmond a year-and-a-half ago with three other units on these sites including Kirkland and Issaquah, we\u2019re headquartered here and one another. We went from 195,000 members or 65 per building on average, maybe we added another 8,000 or 10,000 over the next year. We\u2019ve reduced the average members, but we added net of cannibalization, 120 to $130 million of extra sales in year one and we\u2019ll grow from there. So, when you do that that changes that growth metric a little bit. Similarly, when we opened in Australia or Asia, we\u2019re afforded huge numbers of new signups in the first year with a lower renewal rate. But nonetheless there have been openings where we\u2019ve had 40,000, 50,000 new members with the company average for all warehouses whose average age is probably in the high-teens, if not in low 20s, an average in the low 60s of warehouse -- of 60-plus-thousand members. So, international impacts it. A few of the LivingSocial things that we\u2019ve done once every year, year or two, all those things have backed that number a little bit. Christopher Horvers : So, I guess, fighting through all the noise, how would you describe sort of like MFI comp trend over the past 12 months, has it improved? Richard Galanti : I would say, -- well, if you take out the benefit of the fee increase and you take out the difference of weeks, my guess has been about the same. I\u2019m guessing we picked up a little from some of the Sam\u2019s closings, the 63 Sam\u2019s closings, we opened up a couple of units less than we did a year ago, and I think proportionately a few less international units. I don\u2019t have that in front of me. So, all those things were tweaking a little bit one way or another. I think overall, the fact that our renewal rates have improved and continue to improve, finally after the impact of the transitions of credit cards in the U.S. and Canada makes us feel pretty good about it. Christopher Horvers : And then, last question, could you give us how many Visa cardholders you have in the U.S. currently and how does that compare to when you entered in with from an AmEx cardholder perspective? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t have that number in front of me. It continues to grow. I believe that in the U.S., our Visa tenders -- total Visa, not just co-branded card, is just -- is approaching 50%, in the high 40s. And it\u2019s probably 55-45 the Costco co-branded Visa. That could be 60-40. I don\u2019t have that number in front of me. But, it continues to grow. We continue to get signups. And I think when somebody sees some of the things we\u2019ve done with some of those monies, talked earlier about investing in price, when you can buy something like a high-end television, that\u2019s already at great value at Costco and then when it\u2019s on MVM or coupon, it\u2019s another 200 bucks off. And then, on top that if you use your Citi Visa card, not only you get a cash card -- and it\u2019s not on every item, but in terms of promotional things that we\u2019ve done over some of the holidays, it\u2019s really worth. And so, those are kinds of things that we\u2019ve used that for. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly. Edward Kelly : Rich, I wanted to ask you about complements. I mean, if you could just maybe reflect a little bit on the impressive run that you had. It wasn\u2019t long ago in U.S. the comps had kind of slowed to the low single digits which now seems like a one-off. But, comps now are above historical -- what you think I guess historical norms. Can you just talk about what you think is driving that incremental strength? And then, how should we be thinking about, I don\u2019t know, I guess, what I would call mean reversion and the timing around that and what is the real mean? And is 2016 even relevant to think about? Richard Galanti : Look, I don\u2019t know, I never went to -- 2016, one, we did a little bit to hurt ourselves when we changed up in the MVMs and greatly reduced the number of promotional days or shopping if you will, and we changed that over a quarter -- over a few months and we got back to where we were. There\u2019s also add-on that the conversion of credit cards where you had a lot of people that were auto renewal on credit card that lost our auto renewal. Any member under the old AmEx program was using it -- a different AmEx card at Costco, whether it was the Delta card or a hotel card, Starwood card, all those things -- some of those became auto renewal. Members opted in to just have auto renewal. Well, when we switched from one card -- one network to another, all those non-cards were bought by the acquirer, all those auto renewals went off. So, I think some of that is tied up into that \u201816 year. I also think that some of the things we\u2019ve done with Buyers\u2019 Picks and Hot Buys and collecting email addresses, again we\u2019re proud of the fact that we\u2019ve greatly increased the number of email addresses we have. Some who look at it, say, why didn\u2019t you do this all along? We did, and we\u2019re not benefiting from that. So, all those things I think have helped us. And hopefully, the norm will continue for a while. But every day is a new day. Edward Kelly : And then, just circling back on e-commerce growth. Obviously, you started the year strong. You\u2019d actually mentioned something, Richard, about people being little bit disappointed when it slowed. Did that surprise at all that it slowed the way that it did? And can you talk about how grocery is ramping relative to your expectations, two-day, same-day, and are there any metrics that you can share relative to the basket size, margins et cetera? Richard Galanti : Well, in terms of when renewal rates or comp slowed a little bit, remember when our shopping frequency had slowed a little bit after this incredible run from \u201809 to \u201815. I remember, at the end of \u201809, when we achieved I think 3.8 or 4.0 frequency up from historical average like 1.7, I was the first to say and remind people, if it\u2019s a lot lower in \u201810, it\u2019s still a good two-year stack because this is not sustainable. And then, for four years, we enjoyed it. But, I think you look at the things that we\u2019ve done merchandising wise, the added brands we have, the better communications tools that we can communicate with our members, and really that low-hanging fruit that we are benefiting from on top of, as one of my colleagues just said, great merchandise at low prices. I mean, there is a lot of new things that we\u2019ve had going on for ourselves. I think that should continue. We still have a lot of buckets here. Edward Kelly : I meant on the e-commerce comp, e-commerce growth, and what we\u2019ve seen recently there relatively how we started the year, has that that small slowdown surprised you at all, and how has like two-day\u2026 Richard Galanti : The e-commerce slowed -- well, we say slowdown, went from a low 30s number to a low to mid 20s number. I\u2019ll through the two-year stack back at you. We feel very good about it. We feel very good about what we\u2019re doing. We think we\u2019ve got a lot of new things to come on and to expand it. And we still have a lot of, if you will, funds in the bucket to drive business in that direction as well. And there are brands that are willing to sell us that historically haven\u2019t. So, all those things help. But, I think the biggest thing is we\u2019re focusing on it. But, we\u2019re focusing in our way. We don\u2019t need to go buy a company and we\u2019re finding out that there is a lot of opportunity for us doing some of the things that we want to do. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin. Paul Kearney : This is Paul Kearney on for Scott. Just a question on growth going forward and also business today. Where do you think you are in terms of wallet share of your current customers? And what\u2019s the biggest opportunity to grow wallet share with customers? And also, if you had to divide going forward where most of your growth is coming from, is it coming from wallet share, is it coming from acquiring new members or continued unit growth in new markets? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Look, frequency is up; average sale is up. We know, there is an example when we did fill that we don\u2019t add a lot of new members, we have a lot of loyal members that are shopping a lot more frequently. We know there our success with both -- when we are asked question what are the big two or three things that impact that help our sales, I think generally speaking, we all generally feel it\u2019s our strength in fresh foods, which continues to grow and improve; it\u2019s our gas stations, which gets you in the parking lot; and the executive membership. And we\u2019re doing a better job of now emailing you. And so, I think all those things have helped. But, as our head of our merchandising would say, it\u2019s great merchandise at low prices, and some of these Buyers\u2019 Picks and Hot Buys have helped as well. Paul Kearney : Great. Thanks. And one quick follow-up, and maybe it\u2019s too early to tell. But, are you seeing any changes in membership trends for your clubs that are more like heavily using Instacart. So, is Instacart delivery for non-members leading to any uptick in memberships for those clubs? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Instacart and others, third parties like Shipt and others -- and Instacart is the big one. We have good relationships with them. And it\u2019s growing nicely. But, it\u2019s still a pretty small part of our -- we have not discerned any big difference there. When we looked -- and this is anecdotal, not statistically valid, but when we looked at it, you take a group of loyal Costco members and then a group within that group who had like characteristics of average basket to shopping frequency and they\u2019re loyal. And then, you have them -- some of them will start using Instacart, some of them are using to fill in, some of it. They may reduce their annual shops by a few and increase this way several. The key for us though is making sure they still get into Costco occasionally. And so far, we\u2019ve seen a net increase in that but it\u2019s a very strong population and it\u2019s very small size in its entirety at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Scot Ciccarelli. Jonathan Livers : Hi, Richard. Thanks for taking my question. This is Jonathan Livers on for Scot Ciccarelli. Just a question on e-commerce as well as it continues to be a focus and you\u2019ve made sizable investments there and still putting up pretty impressive growth. Could you tell us what percentage of e-commerce is shipped I guess stores versus shipped by vendors? Richard Galanti : Very little if -- I mean, 50% is us, but not to the warehouses, just us shipping directly from our e-commerce fulfillment centers. Very little is done at the warehouse. Jonathan Livers : Okay\u2026 Richard Galanti : And by the way, it\u2019s only the business center with our two-day dry. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen. Oliver Chen : Hi, Richard. Regarding e-commerce, as it becomes a bigger percentage of your total business, what are the main dynamics in terms of the margin impact there? And you have been speaking about this, but what are your main -- how would you prioritize the main drivers to drive the awareness growth of e-com and the kinds of initiatives that you\u2019re pursuing as that seems like a big opportunity? Richard Galanti : Again, we said before, first and foremost, we wanted to get into the facility. And there is certainly in some categories, like white goods and big ticket -- fiscal [ph] ticket items as well, e-commerce is the way to go in a big way, and we certainly benefitted from that. We don\u2019t see e-commerce taking over our brick and mortar. We\u2019ve also tried to figure out how to do some of the e-commerce or delivery related activities that some members want and then we could provide savings too, but doing it our way. So, I think there is still plenty of low-hanging fruit. And, we don\u2019t want to get comfortable at just shopping at Costco online, unless there is not a Costco within 100 miles. Oliver Chen : Okay. And Richard from a modeling perspective for CapEx for next year, what are some of the major buckets and how should we think about how that will unfold? Richard Galanti : Well, first and foremost, it\u2019s warehouses. And to the extent there is few -- more international, couple of more, IT is few-hundred extra. I mean, it\u2019s not extra from the year before but general. We\u2019ve got a chicken plant, which is north of $300 million, a big chunk of that is expended in fiscal \u201819 and we really started spending money. The cheapest money was the acreage; the expensive money is the facility and all the equipment and everything. And the whole fulfillment -- I guess, what\u2019s new would be some things like the chicken plant would be some of the fulfillment activities we have on two-day delivery, and e-commerce, small package e-com where that\u2019ll be a savings frankly to us. But we\u2019re just -- we are doing a lot of those things a lot more manual than we need to do. Oliver Chen : Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Richard Galanti : [Multiple speakers] So, there\u2019s a few extra things. I think, the number would still be in the very high-2s ish, low 3\u2026 Oliver Chen : Okay. And lastly, the multi-vendor-mailer. Are you pretty pleased with the state of it now? Is it in the right place? I know, it\u2019s an important document, and you\u2019ve been thinking about making sure that it\u2019s sufficient with respect to breadth and depth? Richard Galanti : Well, I think, we\u2019re pleased. Other than a year and a half ago, -- nine months when we changed the number of MVM days in the warehouse which hurt frequency in the warehouse, once we changed that back, the fact that we\u2019ve reduced the number of offerings in an MVM by 20-plus-percent and increased the total value by more than that and by net positive, and it\u2019s definitely working in terms of what we want to get out of it. Remind you also, we\u2019ve taken some of those items -- not every item is that works the same way. Sometimes some items that have been regular to get stale; sometimes we\u2019ve got to shake it up a little bit or change the value proposition; sometimes we take it out of the MVM and do it in the different way with these Hot Buys and Buyers\u2019 Picks. So, I think we\u2019ve in a way added to the arsenal a little bit, and it\u2019s working, but it\u2019s still -- it\u2019ll still evolve some more. Oliver Chen : And do you believe that tariffs will contribute to risk factors with consumer confidence? Like, what are your thoughts on how that may interplay, because we have such -- we\u2019re in such a great backdrop currently? Richard Galanti : Look, on an item given basis, when you have an expensive discretionary item, take like a patio set, I\u2019m just using that as an using example. You\u2019re going to have a less demand probably. Is it going to change? I remind you, there\u2019s a few items on the food side that are going the other way, because this -- examples of pork where something like a third of the U.S. pork goes -- is exported to China; that\u2019s changed. Therefore, pork prices are way down, there\u2019s great savings. That\u2019s creating some opportunities. Same thing with nuts; same thing with soybeans, I believe. I\u2019m just giving you some anecdotal examples. So, you\u2019re going to lose some and win some. How it impacts -- I think everybody feels that tariffs -- people smarter than me don\u2019t like them. And so, it\u2019s probably a small bit negative. Certainly, whatever negative it is, we can weather it better than others. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich. Greg Melich : Hi. Thanks, Richard. I had a couple of questions. One was on gasoline, obviously, grown a lot. But what was the gallon growth from the quarter, and did penny profit actually improve? It sounds like it did. But I just want to see if that\u2019s the case? Richard Galanti : The gallon increases were in the low-double-digits, 11% or 12%. Greg Melich : Got it. Richard Galanti : Which is huge compared to the U.S. economy. That\u2019s also new gas stations as well. But I think the comp, it\u2019s got to be in the high singles. Greg Melich : And how many new -- I mean, stations are at most of the clubs that you can have them, right, is there a penetration number you have? Richard Galanti : Well, new openings are getting up more so than not. And internationally, we\u2019re still adding we can. I think, in the Australia with 10 locations we\u2019ve got 4, maybe 5 with gas; Mexico, we are adding some; Japan, we have a few. U.S. and Canada certainly is more saturated with gas stations. And we would say we\u2019re not going to have one in 117th Street East Drive. But where we can -- generally speaking, where we relocate, we do. A good example in your neck of the woods is where we took the old land, occupied or constrained Hackensack at Costco and moved it to Teterbor, and then turned the Hackensack into business center. Teterbor is I\u2019m guessing here 20,000 square feet larger with all the bells and whistles with the gas station and with a lot better parking, and so, a few here and a few there that way. Greg Melich : And then, a follow-up on the cobranded card, if I did my math right, sort of upper 20% of the tender now would be on your card in the club. If I remember correctly, the part of the benefit of this is getting people top of wallet and getting them to use it everywhere. Do you have any sort of update on the usage of how much more it\u2019s being used outside of Costco, and therefore, how much more loyal that member is in terms of using the card and then, coming back to the club? Richard Galanti : I\u2019ll just say, yes, we do. We do have that information. But we\u2019re not\u2026 Greg Melich : Okay. Is it the same -- is it back to where it was with AmEx, I guess is what I would say, or above? Richard Galanti : I think it\u2019s quite a bit above. Greg Melich : Quite a bit above. That\u2019s very\u2026 Richard Galanti : It continued to grow. And actually, keep in mind, part of that is the fact that it can be use at more places. So, if we get -- whichever of those cards was your top of wallet, you have more potential to use it today than you did before. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler. Matt Fassler : My first question relates to SG&A, kind of couple of moving pieces. First of all, it looks like the wage increase that you discussed probably drove the SG&A higher by a bit less than the percentage points, so not an overwhelming increase. Just trying to benchmark the year-on-year increase when you exclude the factor of the extra week a year ago. I went back and you weren\u2019t terribly granular I think on last year\u2019s call about the expense profile of that extra week. So, as we think about the apples-to-apples increase because clearly the SG&A seems like it\u2019s going to -- might increase at a slightly accelerated rate with the wage increases. How -- was that an average week that you would have had for the extra week a year ago, are there expenses that don\u2019t get carried in for the extra week? Richard Galanti : There is little, if any, expenses, similar to kind of what people said, virtually nothing. So, the weeks are fully allocated. It\u2019s not like if we took an annual expense and divide it by an extra week or had a free week at the end of the year, we don\u2019t. We do it by the number of days and the year, and so nothing there. What was the other part of the question? There was a response for it. Matt Fassler : No. I think you got that one. Richard Galanti : In terms of the wage increases related to the tax reform. At the time we did that, we announced it was going to be somewhere between $110 million to $120 million a year. Matt Fassler : And so, I guess, partial impact here in Q4 given the June implementation\u2026 Richard Galanti : Right. June 11 -- was about three quarters -- it was 12 -- even though Q4 is normally a 16-week quarter, not a 12-week, it was about 12 of the 16 weeks was this. Matt Fassler : Secondly. Your inventory increase was a bit higher and it did speak to frontloading some receipts in anticipation of tariffs. Was that a factor, or anything else moving the inventory in that direction? Richard Galanti : When I look at the list category-wise, electronics year-over-year is higher, by choice. A little of it -- some of it\u2019s volume but a little of it is what you just mentioned. And I think, the last thing is that we currently have increased our inventory levels, particularly in e-commerce and delivery-related items. Matt Fassler : And then, finally, on renewal rates, you seem to have shaken off some of the cobwebs that emerged I guess in the period after the credit card transition, your U.S. and Canada renewal rate is back to where it was in the third quarter of 2016, so I guess the best in nine quarters or so and even more so for the worldwide rate. Have we sort of shaken the cobwebs off now? And are we -- do you think there\u2019s more room to move higher here or do you think we\u2019re kind of back at that level where we\u2019re likely to plateau? Richard Galanti : Who knows? I think we feel good about the royalty and what we\u2019re doing to brand royalty, there\u2019s some things that impacted either little up or little down. It depends on rounding next tenth [ph] or not. When we do one of those -- I think we\u2019ve done four of them now in the last four or five years, like the LivingSocial or anything like that; you\u2019ll get an extra 250,000 members in a 10-day period or 12-day period and would by definition have a lower renewal rate in your hands. So, that hurts you a little bit. And that anniversaries a year later and it helps you a little bit. So, there\u2019s lots of little things like that. But, when we look at the underlying, the rates and I look at -- even taking a country like Australia, which is really 10 locations, its renewal rate, it\u2019s still in the 70s, but it\u2019s relatively new. The average age of those locations is, what, four years-ish, maybe. And I look at the last four years, I only know this because I am going there next week, and its renewal rate has consistently improved for the company in each of the last four years, which is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in other countries. So, I think the bellwethers are of course U.S. and Canada where we\u2019re mature, the average age of these locations are in the 20s, and so far so good. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict. Peter Benedict : Hey, Richard, a clarification just on the CapEx. I just want to make sure I heard you right. So, CapEx this year, high-2s, maybe low-3s with the incremental increase driven I guess part of it by the chicken plant. Is that the way we should think about it? Richard Galanti : Yes. Typically, our own internal budgets are $200 million to $300 million above where we come out. I believe this year, we maybe were $100 million above, right at 3 or 3.1, and that includes the beginnings of the chicken plant, so additional things we\u2019re doing with fulfillment. So, I think overall, something in the high 2s or -- I think we\u2019ve graduated from 2.5 to 2.8 range, to 2.8 to 3.1 range. Peter Benedict : Do you have the fourth quarter CapEx number? Richard Galanti : Not yet. It will be in the K in a couple of weeks. Peter Benedict : Okay. On the international openings, you said 75% of the clubs this year are going to be in the U.S. But you said you got a bigger pipeline internationally, they take longer. Is there a timeframe where we should be thinking about when non-U.S. club openings will account for more than half of your openings, is that a couple years down the road? Richard Galanti : If you had asked me couple of years ago, I would say it\u2019s three years around the road. If you asked me today, it\u2019s probably two to three-year around the road, and I could be wrong by a year further. We do definitely have more in the pipeline. And we have also been surprised by more opportunities in the U.S. that we -- if you go back to 10 plus years ago, some of the cities we\u2019re in today, we would\u2019ve said that we\u2019re not going to go there. There is always -- there is somebody else there already and it\u2019s not that big of a town. But we\u2019re finding success in those examples. So, I think we -- ultimately international -- I don\u2019t know what it is, whether it\u2019s three years or four years from now or two years from now. Peter Benedict : Okay. Last question just around brands, both yours and others\u2019, which categories beyond white goods are you seeing kind of an incremental step up in your ability to get premium brands? And then what was the private label penetration for 4Q and for the year? Richard Galanti : It can\u2019t give you the latter number. But in terms of ability to get new brands, apparel continues, cosmetics, some specialty food items but those are fewer and further between, sporting goods to some extent. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania. Kelly Bania : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, Richard. Wanted to just ask about -- with e-commerce now about 4% of sales, just curious what percent of your members are really engaging online? And I guess in connection with kind of the renewal rates question. As you look at those members that are engaging online, are they renewing at a similar rate or higher rate, just curious how that could influence the renewal rates over time. Richard Galanti : We don\u2019t disclose how many of our members. It\u2019s increasing dramatically but from a smaller base, because we have tried in the past. As it relates to -- I\u2019m guessing, I know the Executive member is more frequent, more loyal than a Gold Star member. An Executive member with a Citi Visa card comes more often and spends more and is more loyal than that. I would guess that somebody who is using it online, if they come from the warehouse and they are using online in addition to that that\u2019s more loyal than their respective groups of those other things. But, beyond that, when you got somebody that\u2019s just using online, I don\u2019t know off the top of my head. Kelly Bania : Okay. And just clarification on the CapEx, I think you mentioned some spend there going towards the two-day delivery program. I guess, what exactly is that for? Richard Galanti : Well, the two-day delivery is with about seven -- most of that\u2019s e-com fulfillment. There is some additional expenditures in some of the business centers including building a couple of business centers in geographies that will greatly reduce the -- what I will call the outsized UPS fees relative to the current mileage that has to be traveled to give those packages to their customers. Kelly Bania : Okay, got it. And maybe just one last one on wages. You\u2019ve obviously been making investments. But with the announcement this week from Amazon going to $15, just curious if you see more pressure from that, or broadly speaking, and how you plan to go over the next couple of years? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, we\u2019ve raised our entry level wages to $14 and $14.50 in United States in the past year related to tax reform. We give increases at top of the scale every year. Even though our starting wage is 14 to 14.50, an employee who\u2019s been here over number of years can get up into the equivalent of the low -- the mid-40s to the mid-50s on an hourly basis over time, on top of the great health benefits. So, at the end of the day, we feel very good about where we are. Employees starting today on a full time basis, it takes about five years to get the top of scale. And I think our average U.S. hourly wage is in the mid-22s, 22.5 roughly, which we believe dwarfs any other retail or retail type entity out there on a base scale. And I believe that you\u2019ll see more pressure on it. And by the way, there are some geographies around the country, even before we raised to it 14.50, we were already above that. We started at about a tranche or two above that because of necessities. Parts of the Bay Area would be an example. Kelly Bania : Thank you. Richard Galanti : One more question. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch. Budd Bugatch : Hi, Richard. Thank you for taking the question and thank you for lasting this long on the call. Most of my questions have been answered, but just on e-commerce. Can you give us the e-commerce impact on comps? Do we have that number? Richard Galanti : I\u2019m sorry, the comps? Budd Bugatch : Yes, e-commerce impact on comps? How many basis points does it impact the comp? Richard Galanti : It\u2019s somewhere in the 70 or 80 basis-point range. Budd Bugatch : Okay. Thank you. And\u2026 Richard Galanti : It\u2019s north of 50 and it\u2019s not 1. Budd Bugatch : Say again. Richard Galanti : It\u2019s not of 50 basis points and it\u2019s below 100. So, I think it\u2019s mid to high. Budd Bugatch : And can you talk a little bit about the demographics of the membership signups by age? What does it look like? Is your average age of members reducing, getting younger, and what about the signup, distribution? Richard Galanti : Well, we feel very good about the signups. But, by the way whether they are called Gen Xers or Gen Zs or whatever they were called before that, that\u2019s what you generally sign these people up. I think, we\u2019re in the very high-30s or low-40s in terms of younger people signing up, which is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen. What was the other part of the question? Budd Bugatch : That was just the impact on the pace? Richard Galanti : I need to find that out myself. I haven\u2019t seen that since we told people that our average member in the U.S. went from 54 to 52. That was a number years ago. Budd Bugatch : Okay. And the last on e-commerce. Is there e-commerce activity outside of the U.S., and can you talk about the strength that you might see there? Richard Galanti : Well, we\u2019re in U.S., Canada, Mexico, UK, Taiwan and Korea. And over the next year and half, I think we have two other countries planned. And it\u2019s growing nicely in other markets. I frankly -- the U.S. e-com business dwarfs the others. And it\u2019s probably had the biggest benefit other than starting off of a very small base, because of where we had taken and combined in line and online buying together two years ago. And I think that we\u2019ve seen a big benefit from that. We\u2019ll do that elsewhere. But, it works. Budd Bugatch : Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck on that on the next period. Richard Galanti : Thank you very much. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed in mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Richard Galanti, you may begin your conference. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon to everyone. I\u2019ll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the Company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today\u2019s press release, we reported our operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and the 12 weeks that ended this past November 25th. Net income for the quarter came in at $767 million or $1.73 a share, a 19.3% per share increase compared to $640 million or $1.45 per share last year in the first quarter. In comparing year-over-year operating results, there were three items noted in the release. One, this year's first quarter benefitted from $59 million or $0.13 per share income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Last year, the benefit was $41 million or $0.09 a share in the first quarter last year. And number two, the Company also recognized an additional tax benefit this year of $27 million or $0.06 a share. This related to the implementation of the 2017 Tax Act. And the third item noted in the release, this year's first quarter results included a charge of $43 million pre-tax, or $31 million after tax, which is $0.07 a share for an adjustment to our estimate of breakage rewards for the Citi/Visa co-branded credit card program, and more on this in our discussion of gross margin. In terms of sales, net sales for the quarter came in at $34.31 billion, 10.3% increase over the $31.12 billion reported last year in the first quarter. In terms of comp sales and the release today, for the 12 week fiscal first quarter, U.S. comp sales on a reported basis were up 11.0% and ex not only gas inflation and FX but revenue recognition, the 11% would be 8.3%; Canada reported 2.4%, ex-gas FX and revenue recognition will be plus 5.5%; Other international reported 4.0%, ex those items plus 5.8%. So total company reported 8.8% ex gas FX and revenue recognition impact 7.5% plus. E-commerce 12 weeks reported 32.3% and again ex those items plus 34%, -- 26.2%. In terms of Q1 sales metrics, first quarter traffic or shopping frequency increased 4.9% worldwide and within the U.S. 5.2%. Weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impact sales. Gas price inflation benefited Q1 comps and revenue recognition benefited as well. Combined those three items added about 130 basis points, essentially the difference you see between the 8.8% reported and 7.5% I mentioned above, cannibalization weighting on the comp by approximately minus 70 basis points. Our average front end transaction or ticket was up 3.7% during Q1 and excluding the impacts from gas and FX and revenue recognition, the average ticket was up approximately 2.4%. Next on the income statement is membership, we reported an increase of 9.5% or $66 million coming into the quarter of $758 million in the first quarter of this year compared to $692 million last year. FX had a negative effect of approximately $6.4 million. So the 9.5% increase would have been about 10.4% ex-FX. Reported membership revenue again was up 9.5. About half of that's related to the membership fee increases taken back in June of 2017. And as you all know, it takes about 23 months to get through the book part of the income statement that benefit. Our renewal rates also rose in Q1. U.S. and Canada membership we made in Q1 end came in at 90.5%, that's up from 90.4% just 12 weeks earlier at Q2 end. And worldwide rate improved to 88%, also up a tenth of a percent, up from 87.9% at 12 weeks ago at Q4 end. In terms of number of members at first quarter end, Gold Star at Q1 end was $41.3 million that compares to 12 weeks earlier of $40.7 million; business primary 7.6% and both at quarter end and -- this first quarter end and year end; business add-ons stayed at 3.3%; all told what we started the fiscal year and we ended last fiscal year with $51.6 million members, we ended Q1 at $52.2 million. Total cardholders at year end from last quarter was 94.3, and again at this first quarter end it was 95.4. We opened six new warehouses during the quarter. Also at first quarter end, paid executive memberships came in at a total at $19.7 million, which is an increase of $442,000 or $37,000 a week since 12 weeks earlier. That's one of the biggest weekly deltas. Part of it depends on when we do different activities to get members to upgrade into as new members sign up as well. So, you'll see that fluctuate but certainly a good showing in the quarter. Related to the annual fee increases, again I mentioned earlier, we've now past the halfway point at last year's fourth quarter. The 23 month cycle, it takes to recognize the incremental benefit from the fee increase. The benefit will continue to diminish in each of the remaining three quarters infused 2, 3 and 4, very little in Q4 actually. And again, that's based on the deferred accounting which we use. Going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was lower year-over-year by 50 basis points, coming in at 10.75% as compared to 11.25% a year earlier. Now excluding gas inflation and revenue recognition that minus 50 would have been a minus 26, and I'll start with my line items, if you want, comparing this minus 50 to the minus 26. If you just jot down two columns of numbers, the five lines; the first line is core merchandise; the second line ancillary businesses; the third line 2% reward on executive membership; the fourth line other; and then the fifth line of course total. On a reported basis, the core merchandise year-over-year in Q1 was minus 43 basis points. Ex gas inflation and revenue recognition, the minus 43 would be minus 22. Ancillary businesses, which was a plus 5 reported; ex those items it would've been plus 11; 2% reward zero and a minus 2; other minus 12 and minus 13; and if you add up those two columns, you get to the minus 50 reported and then ex gas inflation, revenue recognition the minus 26. Now again going to the core with minus 43 ex those items going to minus 22, that's again based on sales penetration of that as compared to the total company as well. If you look at just the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales, what I call core on core, margins year over year were lower by 6 basis points. Subcategories within core gross margin year-over-year in Q1, both food and sundries and hard lines were up and soft lines and fresh foods were down. And then net of those four categories was a minus 6. Ancillary and other businesses, as I mentioned reported plus 5; plus 11 ex gas in revenue recognition in the quarter; gas was up, e-com was up a little; businesses were up a little, pharmacy a couple of other things were down a little. But net of those all, they were 11 basis points ex those items. The other net fee $43 million pre-tax amount that I mentioned earlier related to the Citi/Visa co-branded card. And we put it here, because it's part of the deal is things like the rewards that are paid out to the cardholders as well as bounties that are earned and revenues that are shared. So this impacts the revenue line of our company and the sales line and therefore it impacts the gross margin percentage. So the $43 million, this relates to our Citi/Visa co-branded credit card program. Over the past few months, we made the decision to expand our efforts to remind our members to redeem their outstanding rewards. By stepping up our reminders, we saw a step up in the redemptions relative to what we've experienced previously. These are the rewards certificates that were sent out in February of 2018. The rewards program on the Citi/Visa card is a calendar your program. So these are the rewards certificates are sent out in February of '18, for rewards earned on Citi/Visa card transactions over calendar '17 and to expire at the end of this calendar year. The $43 million adjustment relates to two things, one to the thing I just explained. I described to the recent increase in these redemptions. And second, the additional breakage amounts now estimated on the rewards being earned and accrued on calendar year 2018 card transactions. These rewards will be sent to the Citi/Visa card holders in February of 2019. So if you see in this line as basically adjustment to our estimate of breakage on rewards earned on purchases made prior to beginning of fiscal '19. Going forward, we're using this lower reward breakage assumption. Moving to SG&A, our SG&A percentage Q1 over Q1 was lower or better by 23 basis points on a reported basis and flat or zero without gas inflation and revenue recognition. Again, came in at 10.13% this year on a reported basis compared to 10.36% last year. Again, I'll ask you to jot down two columns and five line items. The first column of course is reported and the second is ex those items. First line is operations, core operations. Q1, '19 reported was lower or better by 23 basis points and lower or better by 4 ex those items. Central -- lower or better, I'll use a plus 9. Central, plus 4 and plus 2. Stock compensation, which is always the biggest impact seems to be in Q1, because that's what we do our annual grants for over 5,000 employees. Stock compensation minus 4 and minus 6 and then other is zero. So your total again reported some of those three line items to plus 25 basis points are lower year-over-year on a reported basis by 23 and the second column basically flat year-over-year on ex those items basis. The core operations complete again was lower, this primary results in sales growth, offset in part by the U.S. wage increase to hourly employees that went into effect -- to most of our employees that went into effect on June 11th. The wage increase negatively impacted SG&A by approximately 8 basis points in Q1 year-over-year, and this will continue to impact the SG&A year-over-year comparisons over the next two quarters. I believe we did it effective June 11, '17 -- in a June 11, '18 go through the same time period a year later. Our central expense was lower or better year-over-year by 4 on a reported basis, and then lower or better by 2 without those items. Within that IT spend in the quarter was flat as a percentage of sales. Stock compensation as I mentioned, the biggest impact typically is in the first quarter, so you'll see a little bit of a difference there. Next on the income statement is pre opening expense that was $5 million higher in this year's first quarter to come in at $22 million compared to 17 a year earlier. We had one more opening this year, but there is plenty of other things going on and not just opening new warehouses with everything from chicken plants to expansion of depots and fulfillment. All told, reported operating income in Q1 came in at $949 million compared to $951 million in Q1 last year. Two other things I mentioned this report of course is that the $43 million related to the city rewards program, as well as the hourly wage increases. Those are certainly two things that have impacted the year-over-year comparison. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense. It was $1 million lower year-over-year coming in at $36 million compared to $37 million. And on the interest income and other, essentially flat year-over-year. Interest income within the numbers was actually $8 million better year-over-year, higher interest rates and a little higher invested cash balance, offset by FX items that amounted to about $9 million to the negative. The FX tends to fluctuate both up and down within prior quarters. In total, pretax income came in at $935 million compared to $936 million a year ago. In terms of income tax rates, income taxes -- our reported tax rate in the first quarter was 15.9% compared to 30.4% in the first quarter of last year. This quarter's tax rate benefited from the lower federal rate related to tax law changes, as well as some favorable discrete adjustments. Notably, the $59 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, compared to $41 million year ago and a $27 million benefit related to the implementation of the 2017 Tax Act as I mentioned earlier before. For fiscal '19 based on our current estimates, as I mentioned each quarter, these of course are subject to change. We anticipate that our effective total company tax rate for fiscal '19 to be in the 26.5% to 27% range. This figure is a little more than a percentage point lower than what we had previously estimated, as I mentioned in our last quarterly conference call, but lower is good. A few other items of note in terms of warehouse expansion, we've opened eight locations, including two relos, so a net of six in the first quarter. For all of '19, we expect to open 20 -- about 23 net new warehouses, as well as four relocations. The two we've opened plus two more planned for the rest of the year. Within the 23 net new, about three quarters of them are in the U.S. and about a quarter of them are international. We're also under construction with our first Costco in China and Shanghai with the expected opening later in calendar 2019. As of first quarter end, total warehouse square footage stood at 111 million square feet. In terms of stock buybacks, in Q1, we've repurchased $34.5 million of stock 150,000 shares. I'll turn my attention to e-commerce. Overall, e-commerce sales increase continued at good levels. Both for the quarter and just last week, of course, we reported the four weeks of -- the calendar four weeks of November, which would include the first week of Q2. For the quarter, reported e-commerce came in at 32.3% up, ex FX and rev rec, they were up 26%. And as you saw last week, the numbers are a little higher than that, both for the four-week November period. In fact, the good news is we've established all kinds of records for orders and sales during the Black Friday through Cyber Monday weekend as I'm sure many else have as well. The top growth categories in the quarter were grocery, consumer electronics, hardware, health and beauty aids and automotive. One highlight of our website refinement during the quarter was our redesign of the home categories. We feel that the refresh made departments like furniture, domestics and house wares easier to shop. With that change, we also expanded some of the product selection within the subcategories. We've now passed our one year anniversary of the grocery launch last October. Same-day grocery delivery is now available to members within the 20 minute drive of 99% of our U.S. locations. Two-day grocery, which we do for our business center is available throughout the Continental United States. We continue to focus on providing great values on high-quality merchandise, and we had a few interesting new merchandise items online this quarter. A couple of examples of fresh white truffles, golf simulators, all types of high-end cosmetics and creams like La Mer. Pendleton in apparel in domestics, George Simonton Couture Cashmere coats, Wheels Up memberships for air travel and even a few Super Bowl packages. And heart of the press, we went live online I think yesterday or last evening, but this morning with a online with newly complete but basically free line of Apple iMac products, both from MacBook Air to MacBook Pro to the iMac and to MacBook, and we're excited about that. And stay tuned for similar offerings in store that we\u2019re working out the logistics of that. We've also continue to improve our online and inline cross marketing initiatives. We continue to do that in addition to drawing attention to our online offerings via these digital communications, we're leveraging that to highlighting feature and warehouse items in hot buys in store and driving traffic. We believe that certainly some of our strength traffic has to do with that. In terms of update on buy online and pickup in-store, we've expanded the selection, no new categories but put some additional assortment and testing pickup blockers in about 10 locations for this program. Overall, these efforts continue to reveal this positive impacting our business and again most importantly, not only online but in warehouse and probably the sales in both ways. Quickly on tariffs, there is not a whole lot new to tell you there. The big news of course in the last week or so is the fact that the planned increase on many items from 10% to 25% tariff rates effective January 1st has been pushed out I believe 60 or 90 days. And so not whole lot new for a quarter earlier. There are some items that when the tariffs have been in the 10 plus percent range have been very little impact on the sales, some has been a little more negative impact. We've particularly done a good job and it's one of the senior merchants mentioned, this is what we do with regular price increases as well, cost increases, we figure out how to get to minimize it. And we brought in additional containers of certain seasonal merchandise early before the January 1st deadline, and we will continue to keep you posted. Lastly, in terms of upcoming press releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five week ending Sunday, January 6th on January 9th after the market closes. With that, I'll open up to questions. And I'll turn it back to you, Liz. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is open. Michael Lasser : Within your core-on-core gross margin, it's been spending a little bit lower over the last couple of quarters. What's been driving that? Are you starting to feel the impact of your pretty rapid e-commerce sales and the margin dilution from that on your core-on-core gross margin? Then I have a follow-up. Richard Galanti : There is two people in the room here, one senior merchant, that\u2019s really us. There has not been lot of change. I was just looking back, if I can -- the fourth quarter, I believe year-over-year, it was lower by two. I believe in one of the two previous quarters on a year-over-year quarterly basis is in the 4 to 6 range. So, it\u2019s really -- we don\u2019t really view it as much more than the things that we're doing to drive our business. We get pretty excited for how to drive sales and whether it's Buyers\u2019 Picks or Hot Buys or some of the promotional seasonal items, I think that's seen in our -- the strength of our business. The only thing that I pointed out in the past quarter or two is on the fresh side, we've seen little bit more margin pressure as there's been a little bit more retail competitive pressure out there, not only from supermarkets but Sam's as well but that's part of the business. Michael Lasser : And my follow-up question is on the expense side, recognizing that you've been investing in wages and investing some of the tax benefit that you got. But you have put up some of the best comps we've seen in a long time and expense leverage has been modest. So when can we start to see that improve? Richard Galanti : Well, keep in mind within these numbers, there's about 8 basis points related to specifically to that what I'll call that extra rate increase that we did in June post the tax at changes. On the IT side, we've got a heck of a lot going on. I think it still will bounce around a little bit, but having it being flat on a year-over-year basically and quarter we're starting to see that. Look, it's all sales related. There is really a lot of different things. We didn't go through all the activities we've got going on now, whether it's related to bringing into some of our depots, the returns activities, the fulfillment side with the success -- with a rapid roll out a year ago into our business centers of the two day and frankly with the success of e-commerce, including a lot of small ticket items or smaller ticket items that just the much higher penetration of bigger ticket items that we used to do be allow the small package fulfillment. We're making sure things get there on time even if it cost us a little more. So, I mean, there's lots -- I can go through a list, there's lots of little things. But I think we've got a lot of good things going on. And as long as we can keep sales going, you'll see that. Michael Lasser : But just should we interpret that answer as, -- even if you continue this rate of sales growth, expense leverage should continue to be modest? Richard Galanti : Well, we'll see. I mean, we never want to predict where it's going to go. Our first -- we are clearly a top line company. We clearly aren\u2019t going to do things to wages or to healthcare costs. Over the time people have always asked us how do we -- what are we doing to control healthcare costs. It's my first somewhat flip, but real answer is, expand more overseas. Healthcare costs as a percentage of sales in the U.S. are 20 to 60 basis points as a percent of sales higher than all other countries. Our foreign pipeline, international pipeline is, it has expanded and I think you'll see that 70.30 or 75.25 U.S. versus international start to move with a little more international. So there is things that we do to ourselves based on when we do it. We've got a lot -- again, we got a lot of things going on with ancillary businesses, with expanding the whole fulfillment in risk and depot system. I think I am beating around the bush because I think we can't really tell you where and when. We feel good about we're building to accommodate even more growth in e-commerce and on the delivery side. And we know that we'll see some of those costs associated with that come down as a percentage of those sales. But we're not going to tell you when it will take some time. Michael Lasser : Okay. Thank you, Richard. I wish you have a good holiday. Richard Galanti : Last one, Michael. I mentioned earlier, the stock compensation. Stock compensation is not just to a few people of this company, it's over 5,000 employees. And in many cases from warehouse manager above and buying managers and above and certainly the senior people, it's 60% to 80% of compensation. Because of our annual grants that invest currently over five years are granted in October, which is Q1. The fact that our stock price has increased as well and acceleration related to 25, 30 and 35, that was 6 basis points of it. You're not going to see that thing forever. If you look back last couple of years, you'll see that typically in the first quarter and that will ease off in the next three quarters. Operator : The next question is from the line of Simon Goodwin from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Simon Goodwin : Richard, I missed some of the prepared remarks. So I didn't hear what the core-on-core merchant margin was. But my question is, if margins let's say came in a little lighter than what The Street was looking for, curious if you can talk about. Is the cost of business going up? Is it reinvestment? Is it investment as external factors? And then I know you don't like to comment on the reinvestment rate. But is that changed this quarter given how much of -- how good sales were and there's more dollars flowing in? Richard Galanti : Well, in terms of -- we're not that scientific and smart about how we do it. We're merchants at heart. And when we see things work we go for it. As it relates to the core-on-core, year-over-year it was down 6 basis points. As I mentioned in the last couple of quarters, we've seen a little bit more competition on the fresh side, which is fine. We've got good fresh sales numbers, but we like others, our competitors are working in a little lower margin there and we're not going to let anybody take it away from us. But that's a small piece of that delta. There is a lot of other moving pieces to it. Part of it is related to the fulfillment side of it. We are encountering slightly smaller margins in some of that stuff as we roll it out very fast. But again, we don't really see -- in terms of are we investing more because we have it no, we invest more because whether we had or not, and we see these things working for us. Simon Goodwin : And then just two quick ones. Can you tell us what the e-com penetration is, either the quarter or just e-com stands? And then the other piece is just cents per gallon or the gas margins, I don't know, but I'm sure you spoke about what they were in and of itself. But has the margins widened out? Richard Galanti : Margins of gas have widened out. I mean everybody -- our sense is everybody is making more money out there. As they make more money, we make a little more money, but we sell a heck of a lot of gas. In the last -- I don't know what it was this quarter, but in the last couple of quarters, U.S. -- whereas overall U.S. gallon consumption is in the very low-single digits. We've been in the high single digits of gallon consumption, physical people coming in and filling up their tanks. And so, that's all good in that regard. What was the other piece of the question, on that e-commerce? Simon Goodwin : The e-com benefit, yes. Richard Galanti : I think it's just under 5%, 4.8% -- approximately 4.8, so somewhere between 4.5% and 5%, but I think 4.8%. But on that I think it was about 60 or 80 basis points impact to the comp, including revenue recognition. Operator : We have the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. Chuk Grom : Richard, just on the other grosses again. I think you said overall down 50 ex rev rec and gas discount 26. Can you quantify with the actual rev rec impact was for 2Q, and how we should think about over the upcoming quarters? Richard Galanti : I can\u2019t give it to you, I don\u2019t have it exactly. Revenue overall was down about half -- I will give you an extreme example though. Historically, what they call a curated travel package where we it put together, we have a commitment to the different components of that travel pack, it'd at the hotels or the cruise whatever. Historically, that was a brokerage fee, a brokerage commission. And I am making this up completely. But let\u2019s say there was $500 brokerage commission, you had no sales -- you had 500 in sales the brokerage commission and essentially no cost of sales. And so we will say that\u2019s a very high margin percentage. Now that was related to, and again I am making this up, a $5,000 cruise package or $5,500 crews package, you would have 5,500 in sales, 5,000 across of sales and above. Now, it's a very small piece of our business but that\u2019s -- for the year that $700 million of it of that revenue recognition. So, there is a lot\u2019s of moving parts within this thing. Chuck Grom : We thought it maybe could be about 10 to 12 basis points, I don\u2019t know\u2026 Richard Galanti : How much, what's that? Chuck Grom : Roughly 10 basis points in the quarter, so we thought that with\u2026 Richard Galanti : Yes, qualitatively, I\u2019m hearing little less than half of it, so 10-some, like it's a little less than half of 22. Chuck Grom : And then just again here just on the model and there is 2017 tax impact that you had. Was that just a onetime item in the first quarter, or is that going to repeat? It doesn\u2019t sound right, doesn\u2019t sound it will based on your 26% to 27% tax rate for the year, but just wanted to\u2026 Richard Galanti : It was one-time. It relates to the tax act, but some of it relates to things that it started for us in fiscal 2019. And by the way, there is still some moving parts to the tax act. I mean, it's hundreds of pages. Some of things don\u2019t work completely outlined. There may be a little pluses and minuses. This was a little bit bigger than a little plus, which was good. Chuck Grom : And then just with -- I think a year from now under the belt with cost of glossary and Instacart. I\u2019m just wondering, it doesn\u2019t seem like it based on how strong November was. Just wondering if you think you're losing any in-store traffic from somebody just replacing that trip with buying online, either though CG or Instacart? Richard Galanti : I think the view is it's incremental. It\u2019s hard to say when the in-store frequencies are so strong. And I don\u2019t think we done a lot of pulling of members to see is this incremental or not. But we feel that we\u2019re seeing less than we originally thought, which wasn\u2019t lot to begin with in terms of does it take away from the frequency in the store. It can\u2019t add to it. But it has opened some new markets for us or some expanded markets. Anecdotally, I have plenty of friends that come up to me and tell me that how they love it in terms of doing more -- some of their incremental food shopping that way or making it more convenient to themselves. And we\u2019re finding the people that live further away are using it more, but these are all anecdotal nothing science related to my comments there. Chuck Grom : And then just a follow up on Simon's question about the e-commerce margins, might have saying historically it's been a margin accretive category for you where it garners the higher margin than the store margins. I just want to make sure that that still in fact correct? Richard Galanti : No, that's never been a higher margin. It\u2019s been a little lower margin. You've got competitive categories like lot of things which nominates the penetration and then there is cost of shipping. And so it's a little lower margin. It's a little lower margin and a lot lower SG&A, so it's a higher P&L if you will in terms of the earnings, recognizing that not every expense is allocated back to it. Operator : The next question is from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. John Heinbockel : Did you see any hardest pressure from the port congestion, either having to pay to prioritize fly product in? And are you seeing any of that today as we go into '19? Richard Galanti : Nothing more than usual this time of year idea, again anecdotally, I know that when we had very strong produce sales on the few items like watermelons around Labor Day. When you have to get an extra container somewhere fast not shipping across, I'm just talking about truck containers or the side trailers, something you paid$1500 for might cost $3500 for that last truck. But again, these were anecdotal stories I heard. My understanding is there was a little backup in China and Shanghai, but not a heck of a lot there. And plenty of part of that is every extra container goes out there merchants like Costco were filling them to bring in things in anticipation of certain tariffs going to 25% on January 1st. Can I interest you in some patio furniture? John Heinbockel : And then broader on supply chain, right. So if you think about, I guess calendar '19. Is the chicken plant the only lumpy thing? So I think that\u2019s still slated for calendar '19. The opening of that -- can that -- will that actually, we'll actually be able to see that in the P&L. And is there anything else lumpy like that that might impact specifically supply chain in '19? Richard Galanti : I think first of all the plan is by early summer, they'll start processing but not 100% capacity and that will take six or eight months to get to 100% capacity. So it's really into fiscal '20, or either mid fiscal '20 going forward, it's running smoothly and we're close to full capacity. There is a few other things that aren't as big and slightly less lumpy. Last year, we opened a commissary, bakery commissary in Canada. It's by no means at full capacity yet. We're adding items that we sell but doing some things that we didn't start off doing there. Same thing we've had a meat plant in Tracy, California for 20 plus years. We opened a second meat plant in Morris, Illinois that will handle the Midwest and East Coast. It's by no means at full capacity yet. And so there's some lumpiness and that\u2019s -- both of those latter two things have been around -- the commissary has been around for over a year, maybe closer to two and the meat plant's been around for a year-ish. And so those are some of those, when I talked earlier about -- I think Michael Lasser was talking about what other things are challenges to SG&A. There's lots of little things like that, notably some additional -- the ramp up in getting up and running fulfillment both for e-commerce and those other two day deliveries. So we've got a lot of little things going on like that. The big lumpy is going to be, I mean just by sheer size of it, is the chicken plant, but that has more to do with this. There'll be some more preopening and there'll be some, perhaps a little more depreciation. John Heinbockel : And then just lastly, are you seeing any early signs of pickup in fresh inflation meat produce? It might be percolating a little bit. But have you seen that yet? Richard Galanti : We haven't. One of the merchants here is shaking their head. Operator : Next question is from Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good evening. So, first of all, on rev rec. So as we think about that gross margin pressure that you experienced in this quarter, is that something you expect for the rest of the year, essentially, there's no recapture or pressure all year because of the change in accounting? And then also on the top-line front, I know you mentioned that there was a benefit to this month on the top-line in November, but that has pressure in December and January. So over the year is the rev rec impact to the top-line neutral? Richard Galanti : That latter question is related to income. Now rev rec will be for the year, I think in our September sales release, we talked about the fact that throughout '19 we estimate that this new standard will benefit sales by about 1%. So 1 point something billion dollars. Some other things have more margin percentage in fact. But and at the end of the day, it has no impact on the bottom-line. Christopher Horvers : But -- understood. So you had a big benefit in this sort of November month in this quarter because of e-commerce, right? And that's rev rec? So you had a bigger benefit now. So it just mitigates throughout rest of the year essentially? Or goes the other way? Richard Galanti : Relatively speaking, there's a bigger benefit at the end of Q1 and into December because of the holidays and the strength in e-commerce. Christopher Horvers : Okay. And then the gross margin, I know it's up and down to the SG&A line, but the gross margin impact persists over here? Richard Galanti : Yes, typically will be an 8 to 10 basis point headwind. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And then, in terms of the e-commerce strength in the month of November, you got a lot of stuff on website, you're advertising it more. Were you more I guess aggressive with advertising or promotions because it was Black Friday or is this just a new normalized rate of like, \u201cHey this is what we're offering\u201d and sort of there's some sustainability to that growth that you saw in the month of November? Richard Galanti : They were the same number of ads or marketing pieces. We have more e-mails that you're sending to. We've done a better job over the years of collecting e-mails. There is better values. I think a year ago we talked about not only online but in-store, better values Hot Buys and Buyers\u2019 Picks that higher traffic and higher conversions. Those are all things -- some of that stuff is improving your site one-on-one recognizing that there are so many things we had done as well in years prior, and the values. I mean I think we've got the attention of the suppliers in many cases and they see how it\u2019s improved their business. Particularly in a way in some cases, those products are doing as well as our competitive brick and motor operators. Christopher Horvers : Yes, I bought a snow blower and it was like 30% cheaper than when I could find at a big box store. So in November, that was my Black Friday gift. My last question -- and they delivered it to my garage. My last question is, what percentage of e-commerce are you shipping currently versus direct from vendor? And where do you think this goes over time? And like what sort of cost savings do you generate over time? Richard Galanti : We are shipping about 50% ourselves and that tends to be the smaller size items and small pack sizes what have you, all the big stuff and all the white cliff stuff like white goods, big electronics, furniture, Italian furniture, those typically are done by third-parties. Christopher Horvers : Is that percentage getting up over time or just because the mix of small items goes up that's what drives it up? Richard Galanti : We'll have to see. I mean whatever is -- what we do whatever way is most economical. My guess is there are going to be some things that we're currently doing third-party that we will bring in-house as we get better and more confident in being able to do it. If you think even going back to some basic things like what we're doing with UPS with two days drive, it's not e-commerce but it\u2019s two day drive. What other things can we do in that box size? We are working with vendors as others I'm sure as well to figure out how to get certain products, how to minimize the freight costs by getting -- given our volumes and our predictability of certain items, how we can get closer in a more efficient way to ultimate delivery to a customer. Operator : And next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open. Karen Short : Hi. A couple questions. Just on tariffs. Can you maybe just elaborate a little on what your pricing philosophy will be with respect to tariffs? Meaning will you address price I guess increases if you need to on a SKU-by-SKU basis or are you looking at the whole box more broadly and trying to figure out how you can offset with a lower price increase across the box? Richard Galanti : It's SKU-by-SKU basis, recognizing it's a heck of a lot easier to do when you're always selling 3,800 SKUs in its entirety to start with. And again it\u2019s part of those price points. I mean I was talking to a merchant yesterday and they're giving examples of where on a $40 or $50 dollar item, that's up 20% or 15% -- 10% to 25%. They see no change in the unit volumes. And there's something -- and first of all if it's in the 10% range, I think we've done -- we feel we've done a good job of working with the supplier, what is the supplier willing to do and to try to minimize that or if there's competing suppliers, getting in more. So there's some items that even with a 10% increase we haven't had to change the price. Now maybe we aid into our margin a little, sometimes not at all. There are some items -- bigger ticket items, where you if you go from 500 to [6.25] at 25% or that may impact the unit volume of that stuff. In some cases, in anticipation of a 25% coming, we cut that quantity a little bit on some items. So it's all over the board, but overall as you might expect here we're going to be in the last increase to the lowest. But it's clearly not subsidizing it with other things. Karen Short : Okay. And then I guess just color -- a little more color on your comment on fresh getting more competitive with both conventional and Sam's. Can you just give a little more color on what you're seeing exactly? And then I guess the question -- bigger question I have is, I mean isn't there a possibility that Sam's continues to get more aggressive on other categories? I mean the pressure will likely spread. So I guess are you seeing any of that there or is it just limited to fresh? Richard Galanti : Look we're respectful competitors. We've been doing this for 35 years. We're not moving away. And we feel we're in a pretty strong area. I mean within fresh it\u2019s produce and protein and whatever comes our way we'll figure it out. And I\u2019m only -- part of challenge here in trying to be helpful to all of you guys is use of examples. It so happens that fresh right now year-over-year is down a little bit. There are times when it's been up. Right now it\u2019s notable. We still feel that we\u2019re getting more bank room from having Sam's close 63 units and certain incremental competition on certain things. And that's what we do, we compete. Karen Short : Okay. And then just last question, you comment on such thing -- pick up lockers in 10 location. Can you maybe just elaborate like how bigger the pick up lockers, is there -- are you kind looking to be expand that or broaden it? And what kind of SKU you would be able to fit in currently? Richard Galanti : Well, I don\u2019t think -- they won\u2019t fit a 60 inch television as an example. They are relatively small in looking I think in 10 locations. Keep in mind the items that we started with and we chose to do first of all were items where we\u2019ve every time -- and again I would have bought that from new Costco but I can\u2019t have it shipped to my office and I don't want to be left on our my doorstep and so I get home from work. And so we think we\u2019ve picked up a little incremental there. What we\u2019re finding is, is that many of these customers, they\u2019ve shifted, they bought it that way, first of all we have more availability of items because we offer a much broader selection that if you order online and pickup in store, you guys are really limited to jewelry items, some small electronics items and handbags. All buildings right away offer the service and show you that there is more out there but it looks as a test, we will figure it up. What we\u2019re not looking to do anytime soon is full order online to pickup in store where groceries A, we don't have the room upfront; and B, we see -- we\u2019re probably little biased that we see that not every customer shows up when they order online. And separator between dryer, refrigerated and frozen and it\u2019s very costly, and we do have an alternative now with the Instacard engine. Operator : We have the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. Edward Kelly : Rick, you mentioned the gas business and margins rising everywhere, we\u2019re seeing that at other companies. Just thoughts on the reason for that and the sustainability of that? Richard Galanti : I think the reason is traditional retailer -- well all companies including us, we want to make money and what we have found is, is that as prices have come down our view is, our motive, if you will, our competitor pricing has gotten bigger. What we\u2019re saving -- you can just look at every week at GasBuddy.com but we do our own price studies. What we\u2019re saving customers relative to competitor stations nearby whether they are independents, or supermarkets or nationals, we\u2019re saving more today than we\u2019ve ever saved per gallon and we\u2019re making more than we\u2019ve ever made, partly because everybody else is making more, we\u2019re able to make a little more. How long does it last? I don\u2019t know. It does seem there is not a heck a lot of traction on gas prices going up. We have mentioned earlier you heard us from me before we want to make a little a lot of times. As it relates to gas I mean we have been enjoying for the last several quarters on a year-over-year basis, close to high single-digit gallon comps in the US population where it's just above flat, low single-digit, so we're definitely taking market share and we're enjoying able to do that while making a little more but not a lot more. Edward Kelly : I just want to take a step back and ask you a question about EBIT growth. If you look at EBIT growth this quarter and adjust for one-time items like the charge on the breakage, adjusted wage investment, remove the MFI benefit. If you do all that it looks like EBIT grew somewhere in sort of like the 3.5% to 4% range. That was about the same as it was last quarter, but yet your comp is 7% to 8%, fuel is contributing. I'm just kind of curious as we take a step back here, help us understand how we read that I guess, why that number is not better and then how do we think about going forward because you might not be comping 7% to 8% forever. Does the kind of flow through improve from here? Richard Galanti : First of all, two things, you mentioned the 3% to 4%. I think as you add those two items and that impact to pre-tax is 6% or 7%. But even that -- and I say the two items, the Citi/Visa breakage as well as our payroll increase on top of everything we took because of the income tax. We knew some of that income tax was going to impact the pre-tax line in that way. The other thing you mentioned a couple of the other questions on there's lots of stuff going on here guys. And I think we're less worried about was gross margin 5 or 10 basis points different than it could have been. It could have been a lot better than what we did, we don't look at it that way, we look at what we can do to drive our business and we still want to make money. We still think long-term. We're creating a stronger and more loyal company. So I think that we're optimistic about what our future holds in that regard, I can't tell you -- I can't give you guidance of where it will go. Edward Kelly : Thank you. Richard Galanti : And by the way, in addition to just the payroll hitting the tax, in our case rough numbers the first full year post the tax reform it's about -- on those pre-tax earnings is a little over 300 million pre-tax. So it's a little over 400 million -- sorry a little over 300 million tax benefit, that's a little over 400 million pre-tax. 120 million that went towards those wages. We view these monies as partly our members and we are doing what we do to drive our business. Certainly what we did to remind our members of the -- those that have the Citi Visa card to drive that business which is long-term positive through their revenue share when it's used outside, as we get more and more people who have it and more and more of impact at the top of wallet. So we think again all these things are driving. Clearly we in the first year of two-day delivery and fresh -- I'm sorry two day delivery and a big ramp-up in small package with the monies we're investing in fulfillment and the monies we're clearly delivering a package to our member even on the two-day delivery side at a more expensive price when we first started today, which is still more expensive than it will be tomorrow. Operator : We have Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer, your line is open. Rupesh Parikh : Good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions, so first on the tax rate housekeeping question. The tax rate that you gave, the guidance, does that excludes the benefits that you saw in Q1? Richard Galanti : Yes, it excludes to those usual things. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. And then on capital allocation perhaps the share buybacks again you guys are not -- you're not buying many shares back. I\u2019m just curious on the special dividend and just how you are thinking about capital allocation going forward? Richard Galanti : Well first of all in terms of buying back stocks we do buy it regularly. We have a metrics that we look at, we adjust periodically as the stock goes up, we buy a little less each day, there\u2019s stock down by a little more. Even it was a small number for the quarter it was a little higher towards the end of the quarter and the beginning of the quarter. But that doesn't -- we will see what next quarter brings. As it relates to special dividends we have made no decision in that fourth special dividend, we've been asked time and time again because each of the three that we've done were spaced about 2.5, 2.25 years apart from each other. So we've been asked what happens in 2.25 years from May of '17 and we said we don't know, stay tuned and see. When we have done them, they've worked well. We still continue to generate a lot of cash in excess of our CapEx and in excess of roughly $1 billion annual dividend that is real historically about 13% a year. So it's certainly on the table but there's no promises of if and when and how much. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. Thank you Richard Galanti : And why don't we take two more questions? Operator : And next question is from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Hey, guys. It's Scot Ciccarelli. Richard, as you guys change your accrual for the rewards breakage, is that something that will be a notable item on a go-forward basis or is it relatively minor and kind of just lost in the rush? Richard Galanti : It was relatively minor, keep in mind, you're talking about an in-reward that's in the $2 billion range a little. And if you look at it, this really effected -- we started doing this a few months ago, these reminders in a bigger way. And if you look at it, is sped up or increased the ones that were going to not be redeemed through that related to 2007 calendar purchases on that card. And then we had an net loyalty accrual for all purchases in '18, we were very lower to the accrual from -- prior to this from the previous year, but that's what we do. On an ongoing basis, I think the impact to the quarter relative to our old one was about a penny a share. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Got it. Richard Galanti : It was like $6.5 million or $7 million pre-tax. So you could annualize that component on an annual basis. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. And then I want to clarify an answer to an earlier question I think it was from Chuck regarding the profitability of e-commerce. Can you help us -- I was also under the impression that e-commerce was a higher let's call it operating profit transaction for you, but the way you kind of phrased it, it sounds like it's a lower gross margin but maybe it's EBIT a positive contributor \u2026.? Richard Galanti : It's a higher -- it's a more profitable operating margin. It has a little lower gross margin and a lot lower SG&A. Maybe a lot lower SG&A is more appropriate when you return lower SG&A because there are a few things that we don't allocate that certainly to it. But like when you buy something online return to warehouse, the warehouse gets charges for that. So we try to do not a complete full but it's charged towards IT expenses and things like that. And certainly on the direct buying and what have you. But at the end of the day we view it as more profitable than the bottom-line of our company as a whole. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it \u2026. Richard Galanti : What? Scot Ciccarelli : I'm sorry. And that is still whether it\u2019s being shipped by you or the third-party that you referenced to an earlier question? Richard Galanti : It's all blended together. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Richard Galanti : Okay. One last question. Operator : And for our last question, we have Scott Mishkin of Wolfe. Your line is open. Scott Mishkin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to make sure I understood the answer to the last question of the $43 million. It sounded like $7 million -- $6 million to $7 million of it is actually not one-time it's going to be kind of an ongoing. Did I get that right or I misunderstood? Richard Galanti : The $43 million relates to activities prior to the beginning of fiscal 2018. That's one-time in sense that goes back to anticipated redemptions higher than what had been previously reserved for both fourth calendar January 1st through December 31st, calendar '17 purchases transactions both in and outside of Costco on the Citi/Visa card. From February of '18 when they were mailed out to everybody they've been redeemed. In the last few months, we upped the amount of times where we remind our members to redeem them. That increased the redemption. So based on what we had previously thought would be redeemed and not expire as of December 31st of this year we have the annual net piece. That's a little over a third of that 42 million. The other piece is all purchases later this year, those card members will receive a rewards certificate in February of '19, but every time a transaction is -- a reward reserved we accrue a little bit of the anticipated breakage or slippage in it. Well with our reminders we accrue a little less than that. So it's also all the purchases made from January 1, '18 through the end of August or September 2 whatever the year end was in fiscal '18, we up the accrual on that. In Q1 based on our lower breakage assumption and therefore higher accrual breakage, a lower breakage assumption, it will -- that was about just under $7 million pre-tax. That's the piece that will be ongoing. Scott Mishkin : Okay. So I think I got that. Richard Galanti : It was about $49 million-ish, almost $50 million. $43 million was one-time prior to Q1. Scott Mishkin : Perfect. And then my second question which is more strategic. I mean we're seeing a lot of companies and I think a couple of questions got to this, is that, as we go more and more and more omni-channel the flow through of our sales, the profitability just kind of comes in. How do you think about Costco? I mean Costco seem not to have this problem but maybe we are seeing a little bit of it as we go more omni-channel, just the profitability of the business gets a little bit -- it comes down a little bit. How do you think about that and how should we be thinking about that? Richard Galanti : Well I think that we were -- in my view we're fortunate that we're not impacted. If you look at traditional department stores which deliver stuff to your home and then you send 70% of it back, it's all free. That's a necessary part of their business. That's not necessarily profitable relative to the old way. Supermarkets, I don't think delivery -- to the extent you can even really take a customer or grow market share that will be incremental, maybe that the negative is offset by the positive of incremental sales. I think we've been fortunate. The way we've done it as it relates to e-commerce in general or even two-day delivery. We did go and spend hundreds, if not a $1 billion dollars around delivery. We\u2019re doing it actually as a partner of UPS limiting the things that we do and it seems to be working. Now we\u2019re still going to improve the cost of delivery on even that because there is some -- we want to be in entire Continental United States, there are some places that are farther away so we pay a little more on that. I think when we look at to the extent it\u2019s incremental, we've found -- I think we\u2019ve also benefited from things like if you look at white goods. Historically when we have limited white goods in store I think four fiscal years ago we did $50 million in US in white goods. Three years later in fiscal \u201818, we did $500 million, and then like 5.0 something in white goods, none of it\u2019s in store. We have displays in locations and display high end LG, Samsung, Whirlpool and like and most people want to deliver and actually the other one take it away. So all that white glove service. We have been fortunate in that regards. There is an example of because of what's happening in the world, if you look at -- you heard me mention apparel where brick-and-mortar apparel is generally down over the last few years that\u2019s given us an opening to buy certain things and historically we\u2019ve put in the quantities, 99% plus of our apparel is still in-store not online, we\u2019re testing these things online. It\u2019s a $7 million category that\u2019s grown compounded for four years in the high 8s. Furniture where we have an in store limited 20,000 to 30,000 feet of furniture for 8 to 12 weeks of the summer, after Memorial Day before Labor Day, we still do some of that in store but now as you\u2019re around online same with patio furniture which is there for 12 or so weeks January through part maybe early April and now geographically the locations that where people buy that stuff year around and have the ability to do that. So I think we\u2019ve been fortunate there are some things that given our item nature of our business has helped us in that regard and perhaps offset with that. Clearly it\u2019s got -- in the first couple of years, certainly these things cost us more. Building out the fulfillment centers, where part of that success online is getting people to open email to click on something and to buy something and where those will be a few years there, and I\u2019m sure if you figure that that but these strong sales will help that.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Vincent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 Earnings Call and February Sales. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to your speaker today Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. Sir, you may begin. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Vincent, and good afternoon to everyone. I\u2019ll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today\u2019s press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the 12 weeks that ended this past February 17th, as well as February retail sales for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, March 3rd. Note that the first two weeks of February fell into the second fiscal quarter with weeks three and four of February are the first two weeks of our fiscal third quarter.  The reported net income for the quarter came in at $889 million or $2.01 per share, a 27% increase compared to the $701 million or $1.59 per share last year in the quarter. In terms of sales, net sales for the quarter came in at $34.63 billion, a 7.3% increase over the $32.28 billion reported last year in the second quarter.  Comparable sales for the quarter, as shown in the press release for the 12 weeks on a reported basis, US was 7.4%, Canada was minus 0.3%, Other international 0.7%, for the total company a 5.4%, as well e-commerce for the 12 weeks on a reported basis was 20.2%. Excluding gas deflation, the impact of FX and some weakening foreign currencies relative to the dollar, as well as revenue recognition, which is an impact this year, the 7.4% reported in US would've been at 7.2%, the minus 0.3% in Canada would be a plus 6.0%, other international instead of being 0.7% reported would be plus 4.8%, for total company the 5.4% reported would become a 6.7%, and again e-commerce reported a 20.2% ex-gas, FX and rev rec 25.5% plus.  In terms of Q2 comp sales metrics, second quarter traffic or shopping frequency increased 4.9% worldwide and 5.2% in the United States. Weakening foreign currencies relative to the US dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 140 basis points and gasoline price deflation was another minus 50 basis points of impact.  Our rev rec actually benefited comp sales by about 55 basis points to the positive. These are the three factors that we adjust for and that are presented in today's release, as the adjusted column. In addition, weather conditions adversely impacted Q2 sales by around 0.5 a percentage point and cannibalization weighed in on the comps by about minus 70 basis points. In terms of front end transaction or what we call ticket, our average frontend ticket was up 0.4% during the quarter and excluding the impacts from gas deflation, FX and rev rec our average ticket was up approximately 1.8%.  Going down the income statement, membership fee income reported came in at $768 million or 2.22%, that's up $52 million or 7.3% from a year ago. Again with weak foreign currencies if you adjusted for flat FX that would make the up $52 million another $9 million up or up 61% -- up $61 million year-over-year ex-FX.  Reported membership revenue of the plus $52 million amount, that\u2019s -- a little more than half of that -- a little more than $20 million of that related to the membership fee increases taken in June of 2017 in US and Canada. We\u2019re now nearing the end of that 23 months cycle to recognize the incremental benefit of the fee increases as that was deferred accounting into our P&L. The benefit to our P&L will be fully recognized in the next two quarters by the end of fiscal year. But as with these last couple of quarters, it diminishes each quarter. In Q3 we will have about half of the benefit recorded in Q2 and then in Q4 it will be very a very small benefit.  In terms of renewal rates in the second quarter, our US and Canada member renewal rates in Q2 came in at 90.7%, up from 90.5%, 12-weeks earlier at Q1 end and worldwide the rate improved to 88.3% up from 88.0% at Q1 end. So improvement in our renewal rates.  In terms of the number of members at Q2 end, the member households and total cardholders, we ended Q1 12 weeks earlier with 52.2 million member households, at Q2 end that was 52.7 million, and total cardholders increased from 95.4 million at Q1 end, this is 12 weeks later Q2 at 96.3 million.  During the quarter, we had one new opening in Coral Springs, Florida and we also relocated in Miami location. At Q2 end, our paid executive membership base stood right at 20 million. This is an increase during the quarter of 341,000 or about 28,000 per week since Q1 end. Now this includes the recent introduction of the executive membership in Korea, which is our fifth country offering executive membership. For Q2 Korea contributed a little over half of those increases.  Going down the gross margin line, reported gross margin in the quarter came in at 11.29% up 31 basis points from last year's Q2 '18 of 10.98%. The 31 basis point improvement ex-gas, FX and the rev rec would be plus 30 basis points.  I'll give you the chart and there is not a whole lot to it given that the adjustment column was not that different than the reporting column. In terms of core merchandise, year-over-year in Q2 was up 1 basis point on a reported basis as well ex-gas deflation in the rev rec up 1 basis point, ancillary businesses up 33 on a reported basis and up 32 on an adjusted basis. 2% reward minus 3 and minus 3 basis points year-over-year. And then total up 31 basis points that I just mentioned on a reported basis and up 30 basis points ex-gas, deflation and rev rec.  The core merchandise component again was higher by 1 basis point here. Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales, what we call core on core, margins year-over-year were higher by 8 basis points. Within the four key sub categories both food and sundries and fresh foods were up a little and soft lines and hard lines were down a little. But the net of the four departments on their own sales was up 8 basis points.  Ancillary and other business gross margin was up 33 basis points, up 32 ex-gas, deflation and rev rec primarily driven by gas and also benefiting somewhat from e-com and a few other things.  Moving to, SG&A, our SG&A percentage Q2 over Q2 was lower or better by 2 basis points both with and without the adjustments coming in at 10.0% of sales this year compared to 10.02% last year.  In the chart that I normally give out there really isn\u2019t not a whole lot to tell you. Operations was an improvement of 2 basis points in both columns, the other 2 line items that we usually point out, central and stock compensation expense were zero and zero, so the total remained at 2 basis points, so overall 2 basis points better.  In terms of that 2 basis points better, we feel it was pretty good result given that we\u2019re still facing headwinds from the US wage increases to our hourly employees that went into effect last June 11th of 2018. As mentioned in the past couple of fiscal quarters, those wage increases negatively impacted SG&A by about 7 basis points to 8 basis points during Q2 year-over-year, and it will continue to impact SG&A comparisons through Q3, which ends May 12th and into the first month of our 16 week fiscal fourth quarter to anniversary on that June 11.  Additionally, this past Monday, we began our new three year employee agreement. With the new agreement, we announced that we\u2019re taking our starting wages from 14 and 14.50 up to 15 and 15.50 per hour in both the US and Canada. In addition we're also increasing wages for supervisors and introduced -- and also introduce paid bonding leave for all hourly employees. These items are incremental to the usual annual top of scale wage increases that are typically done each March. Collectively, these additional items will add about 3 to 4 basis points to SG&A over the next four quarters.  Now again this is on top of that 7 to 8 basis point impact I just mentioned that will impact the SG&A through this coming mid June. Otherwise, pretty comparable year-over-year in terms of central and stock comp and other various SG&A expense line items. Next on the income statement is preopening. Preopening expenses were actually lower by $3 million coming in this year at $9 million compared to $12 million last year. This year again, we had two openings, one net opening and one relocation. Last year we actually just had one opening. There's other activities that relate to preopening as well. Year-over-year primarily the difference is due to the $4 million in Q2 last year related to our -- opening of our new meat plant in Morris, Illinois slightly offset by higher warehouse preopening this year due to the additional opening.  All told, reported operating income in Q2 '19 was up 18.4% coming in at $1.203 billion this year compared to $1.016 billion last year. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was $3 million lower or better year-over-year, coming in at $34 million this year in Q2 as compared to $37 million last year. The actual interest expense quarter-over-quarter each year is about the same, a little bit more -- a little delta in improvement in capitalized interest amounts. Interest income and other third quarter was better by $39 million year-over-year. Interest income itself was higher by $17 million year-over-year in the quarter, a combination of higher interest rates being realized and also higher invested cash balances. Also benefiting the year-over-year comparison were the various FX items in the amount of $22 million.  Recognize that much of this is essentially an offset to lower reported operating income and earnings in our foreign operations due to the strength of the US dollar versus many of the foreign countries, the currencies in the countries where we operate compared to last year.  Overall, pre-tax income in Q2 was up 23% coming in at a $1.250 billion this year compared to last year $986 million. In terms of income taxes our income tax rate was a little better than we had anticipated, came in at 25.8% effective tax rate during Q2 '19 compared to 27.7% in Q2 last year. For all of fiscal '19 based on our current estimates which again are subject to change, we anticipate that our effective total company tax rate for the fiscal year to be approximately 26% to 26.5%. This figure is about 0.5 a percentage point lower or better than we had previously estimated a quarter ago. This is primarily due to a Q2 tax rate that now includes a one-time benefit for certain foreign tax credits. This one-time tax benefit will continue through the end of the fiscal year, but we do not anticipate a similar type of benefit beyond fiscal '19.  A few other items of note, again, we opened a net one unit during Q2, opened two including a relocation. In Q3, we have three new openings planned and no relos. We actually opened this morning in Bayonne, New Jersey. In late April, we plan to open our 16th location in Korea; and in early May, our 11th location in Australia. The big expansion quarter for us this year is Q4. We plan to open a net of 12 units, 14 openings include two relos, including our first opening in China in Shanghai in the City of Minhang; and also our third unit in Spain, which would be our second in the Madrid area. Any of these can slip a little bit better for our best guess right now is 14 openings including to relos, so a net of 12. As of Q2 end total warehouse square footage stood at the 112 million square feet. I might also add that in terms of CapEx we continue to allocate more CapEx to grow and support our operations, including as you know over the last year, year-and-a-half we had opened a second meat plant, the first one in California many years ago and then in Morris, Illinois, also a little while ago our Canadian bakery commissary in Canada. We are under construction with the big chicken plant in Nebraska. We plan to start initial processing and production later this year. Depot expansion we are doing that in many areas around the world. Also, we -- just a month ago I believe we started up our first fulfillment automation operation near our -- next to our -- as part of our Mira Loma Depot. This is for small packages for e-commerce and we plan two more of those this year at other depots.  In terms of two-day grocery, which as you know we started in October by year-and-a-half ago. We did that out of 10 or 11 of our business centers around the country and we are in the process of moving these operations out of the 10 to 11 business centers to six of our depots over the next several months. I think we've done the first one, and we have got several more planned right around the end of spring, beginning of summer. In terms of stock buybacks, in Q2, we expanded $117 million to repurchase 561,000 shares at an average price of $208.72. The $117 million of course is significantly higher than the Q1 purchases of $35 million.  In terms of e-commerce, overall again e-commerce sales increased during the quarter on a reported basis 20.2% and ex-FX and rev rec up 25.5%, continued increases in e-commerce in terms of orders and sales and profits and other metrics. Top growth categories in the quarter, quite a few actually, grocery, consumer electronics what we call majors, hardware, health and beauty aids, tire automotive, toys seasonal, and apparel. We have now passed our one year anniversary on the grocery launch which was again a year ago October. Same day grocery delivery is now available to members within a short drive of 99% of our US locations. Two-day grocery is available anywhere throughout the Continental United States and while still these are small pieces of our total business operation they are growing nicely. We now have grocery shipments to all 50 states. In terms of the e-commerce, in terms of new brands and items online during the quarter, we are now offering a much broader selection of Apple products, including the recent addition of MacBooks and iMacs and yes you would expect good values to our members. Also the first of what we expect several products from Sony, they just started to arrive. In terms of health and beauty aids names like Living Proof shampoo and conditioner, Murad Skin Care and Kate Somerville items. On the exercise front, NordicTrack is a new name. And finally, I had pointed out that now somewhat famous 180 serving 23 pound 20 year shelf like macaroni and cheese for $89.99. If interested, you can find that online under emergency supplies and in a few of the Costco locations. We continue to improve our online and in line cross-marketing initiatives and we think that\u2019s continuing to drive our business. In terms of buying online and pickup in store, in the quarter, we expanded our selection within the same categories, jewelry, some electronics and handbags and continue to test pick-up lockers in 10 locations for this program.  Lastly, this calendar year, we will begin e-commerce operations in Japan early summer likely and in Australia late summer, early fall.  Finally, I\u2019ll turn to our February sales results, the four weeks ended March 3, 2019 compared to the same period a year-ago. As reported in our release net sales for the month came in at $10.72 billion, an increase of 5.0% from $10.21 billion a year earlier. In terms of comparable sales US on a reported basis for the four weeks was 6.0%, ex-gas, FX and rev rec that 6.0 would be 5.7, Canada on a reported basis zero ex-gas, FX and rev rec, plus 4.8; other international reported minus 5.9; and again, adjusted with ex those things, minus 1.2%, total company came in at a 3.5 reported and a 4.6 ex those items.  In terms of e-commerce reported for the four weeks 24.2%, and ex those adjustments -- appropriate adjustments 21.6% up. February sales were negatively impacted by weather throughout the US and Canada in a big way. We estimate that negative impact on the total company was approximately 1% and a little more than the 1% figure in the US and Canada.  In addition, Lunar New Year and Chinese New Year occurred in February as same as last year, however, 11 days earlier this year. This is an important holiday in terms of sales strength. The holiday shift negatively impacted February's other international sales by we estimated 450 basis points to 4.5 percentage points, and total company sales by about 0.5 percentage point.  Looking at January and February combined, effectively eliminating the impact of that holiday shift, the comp for other international for the eight weeks was 0.2% reported and plus 4.9%, ex-FX, gas deflation and rev rec. The US regions were the strongest results in February with Midwest, Northeast and Southeast, and internationally the strongest results were mixed across Japan, UK and Spain. Spain of course is relatively new with two locations. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to US dollar hurt Feb comp sales by -- hurt February comp sales in Canada by approximately 460 basis points. Other international also by about the same number basis points about 4.5 percentage points, and total company by an estimated 130 basis points. The negative impact of cannibalization was about 50 basis points negative in US, 80 in Canada and 120 in other international, for total company minus 70.  Within ancillary businesses hearing aids, optical and food court had the best comp sales in February. Gas price deflation negatively impacted total reported comps by about 75 basis points. The average selling price during the four-week month compared to the year earlier was down 6.3% year-over-year, the average gallon a year ago we sold for $2.74, this year $2.56. Including the adverse impact of weather and the holiday shift in Asia, our comp traffic or frequency for February even if taking those into effect -- taking those impact into effect February was up 2.7% worldwide and plus 3% -- 3.2% in the US.  For February the average transaction was up [0.8%] for the month, again this includes combined impacts from FX, gas deflation and rev rec. So that's about it in terms of our prepared notes.  Lastly, in terms of upcoming releases we will announce our March sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday April 7th, on April 10th after the market close -- after the market closes. With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back over to Vincent. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We have your first question, comes from the line of Christopher Horvers from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, Richard. So a question on the core margins, the core margins performance this quarter was much better sequentially, I think everyone is sort of taken by surprise by the core margins ex-gas in the last quarter and now they're looking much better. So can you put it into context what sort of drove that change and any commentary about how you're thinking about core margins as you look forward? Richard Galanti : Honestly you know we drive our business by driving sales and usually that means lowering prices on things which we continue to do, and we're also buying better all the time. Some of it\u2019s mix, some of it -- the one category that shifted if you look back over the last few quarters of reports where we look at core on core, fresh foods has been a little down and I think the keyword here is little. I appreciate the fact that every basis points for us is $14 million plus pre-tax a year of [nearly 1 billion] [ph] but you are talking about 5 to 10 basis point swings here and there's a lot of things that impact it, whether it's freight, tariffs, some -- negative, in some cases not as bad as we thought. I think we've done a great job and we continue to do a great job particularly in fresh food organics where there's a little -- I believe there's a little less pricing pressure and some competitive pressure, but don't get me wrong, as soon as we have a good quarter next quarter we will change that.  Not giving any guidance, we know that we keep it pretty steady and we feel pretty good about it, whether it's up a few basis points or down a few basis points. Christopher Horvers : Got it, and then just a question about the gas margins industry wide, I understand there are a few ways that gas impacts margin, but if you just focus on the fact that it seems like the core cents per gallon has improved across the industry, the independents may be in the integrated has taken a little bit more and that's given you some room to take a little bit more. So can you talk about what you're making sort of per gallon I guess relative to say last year and maybe a couple years before that? And as you think about the upcoming years, is there anything that you're seeing that would suggest that, that core profitability of every gallon sold is all of a sudden going to revert back to what it was a number of years ago? Richard Galanti : I think over the last several years the new normal is better. If you go back to when gas prices sky rocketed several years ago and as they started coming down, what we saw, and what we read frankly from others is that as they came down not all of those savings were passed on to the consumer. They gave us perhaps a little bit bigger window, we're still -- I think if you ask our gas -- the people in charge of gas operations around here, we're saving the customer a little more today and making a little more because there's just a bigger opportunity of [gap][ph] there. It really comes down to that. It is still a volatile, no pun intended profitability item. It can swing back and forth, based on underlying cost of goods sold that change daily. And -- but the new normal is better in all those examples. But I'm sure there will be quarters, this was a -- Q2 was a particularly good quarter. But as I believe Q2 a year ago was a little better than the other three. But that\u2019s not seasonal necessarily, it\u2019s just -- there is a lot of different factors, what's going on in the news internationally, what's going on with inventory levels, world and US inventory levels, what's going on with -- inevitably a refinery shuts down for two weeks for their planned repairs, it takes four weeks. So any of those things switching from winter to summer blend and back. All those things impacted. I think we are fortunate in the fact that we turned a lot of gas. We literally turned inventory about daily and as you know we have locations with up to 24 pumps and they are backed up all the time, it\u2019s great. So I think we\u2019re in a fortunate position that overall retailers whether it\u2019s retailers that have gases in their parking lots, like supermarkets and discount stores and ourselves or full line independent retailers or the ones with the convenience stores, I think everybody seems to have been taking a little more and that's given us an ability to do so over the last couple years. But I guarantee it will evolve and we will always tell you that it was certainly a little more of a benefit this quarter than normal but it was a year ago too. Christopher Horvers : So then just a quick one on that. So of the 30 odd basis points in ancillary this quarter, should we assume some portion of that comes out [indiscernible] the second quarter, is there like anything that you would say is one-time that we should put back next year on behalf of it? Richard Galanti : I wouldn\u2019t use the word one-time, I\u2019d say unpredictable, and it truly is not predictable. We know that when demand rises at the beginning of summer that impacts -- the gas prices have a little bit more positive pressure on them. And where prices are going up not only for us but when I read the profitability of gas and other big retailers, supermarkets and Walmart alike, it impacts them as well. When prices are going up we are all making the less, when prices are going down we are making a little more. We I think are in the enviable position to being extreme. And as overall, the retail environment has chose to make it a little more -- it gives us an ability to make a little more -- a less than a little more as to make more but even be greater savings to our member. I mean -- and that\u2019s the thing that we are focused on. Are we saving our member more than we used to? And we are. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Hey, Richard. A follow up on the gross margin or the core margin. You mentioned mix helped a little to dig in, anything about mix that was either seasonal or something that is changing. You said it was always lower product acquisition cost. Can you remind us when your own [check up plans] [ph] is coming up? And then one more in that mix, can you tell us the channel mix between physical and digital, is that sort of embedded gross margin improving as well? Richard Galanti : No, overall our gross margin online is a little lower than our company overall, part of it is the product mix itself and part of it is we are driving that business. The [banana] [ph] hasn\u2019t changed, that\u2019s been that way. We also work on a lower SG&A online as you might expect. In terms of mix there are so many different pieces to it honestly. Part of it is, when you walk into a Costco in the US roughly 90% of the goods are -- come through our cross-stock operations. For us cross-stocks are very profitable. It\u2019s the most cost efficient way to ship stuff. Nobody can do that to the extent that we do it because of how we sell goods in pallet and large case quantities, so I mean there\u2019s lots of little pieces to it. I think private label and continuing penetration of private label, fresh, but all these are anecdotal. There is no one thing that\u2019s driving in a particularly large direction. We think we are pretty good at what we do and we\u2019re constantly buying better even as it related to tariffs, which so far so good in terms of being on hold, but we don't know, what's in the future. I think bigger retailers have the ability to buy better. Simeon Gutman : And then shifting to SG&A, in the past I think you talked about [indiscernible] your comps hold up in mid-single-digit, you\u2019re leveraging, and that was based on some [indiscernible] of spending, there was IT, there was technology. Has anything on the spending side changed, any curve, that\u2019s increasing, decreasing on that same mantra of about mid-single-digit comps, that [indiscernible] to give you leverage? Richard Galanti : Yes, hopefully it won't and while -- the word modernization I think is finally been retired around here. We are still spending a lot and we're going to continue to spend a lot as some of these new things come online like the chicken plant, like the fulfillment automation. These are $50 million to $100 million plus items, chicken plant is more, where a bigger chunk of it is things like equipment and software that is depreciated over a shorter period of time than steel buildings. And that's --all those things [hitting us] [ph] as well. I think the fact is as we've been fortunate with our sales levels. As they go down that will hurt us a little. We are achieving our current SG&A with all the things that we haven't talked about some of these other items that impacted the other way. There are lots of little things and we are not terribly worried though if some of these things -- if sales were to come down a little and some of these things will impact us, so be it, we're going to do what we do and drive the top-line. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Your line is now open. Chuck Grom : Just on the pricing front, I'm curious how you guys are handling increases in certain categories including any of those that maybe impact by tariffs, just -- are you looking to pass along those increases and do you think that may have helped out the core margins at all here in the second quarter? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t think it would have helped the margins. This question is did it hurt it or not hurt it. And probably it hurt it less than one might think but that again gets back to our ability to buy right and to send those 10% tariff items so as examples versus 25 that's a big difference, in some cases you've got your vendors along with us, ease out a little bit, sometimes not. I think it\u2019s just one piece of what we do. The fact that organic helps us, the fact that KS helps us. The fact that we don\u2019t talk about but we really plan through a lot on the marketing dollars that are out there now, that some of those impact cost of sales. Chuck Grom : And I guess just a follow up on Chris\u2019 question here, you've got three consecutive quarters in a row of the core on core, core being negative in this quarter, what\u2019s the positive, is there anything else you could point to? Richard Galanti : I would read a lot, look we are happy about it and hopefully you are happy about it. It's not -- it\u2019s how we run our business. We didn't sit there and say hey let's get it up a little higher, it is a few basic, it is I know we were a basis point company and you guys have known us for 30 plus years we talk about basis points. It's some minor switches, it's nothing that we\u2019ve changed dramatically and there's so many different moving parts to it frankly. Chuck Grom : Understood. I guess the other bright spot here in the quarter was the renewal rates are picking up nicely if you look back at the cadence in '18 they were pretty steady but they're showing a nice uptick both in US and worldwide, just wondering if you could comment on that improvement? Richard Galanti : Well, we like it. Look we focus on all the things that we feel we should be focusing on, customer service, great products, great services at the best prices. We've been fortunate notwithstanding the fact that we really don't have a PR department per se, that there's been a lot of good press about us, about purple signature, about our e-commerce site and customer satisfaction. I think that we've been blessed that some of the weaknesses that traditional brick-and-mortars or traditional formats have had in some ways have helped certain other discounters like ourselves and hopefully that'll continue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Edward Kelly : Good afternoon, Richard. I wanted to start with just a follow-up on fuel. If we were thinking about trying to strip out fuel and the impact, do we take the majority of the 33 basis points in order to do that? And then is there any intentional reinvestment to sort of consider as we think about this? Richard Galanti : On the latter part of the question, there is no intentional reinvestment. I mean there is a 100 different moving parts to our company all the time and we do what we feel is right. It's kind of like a question that was asked a year ago, we were asked about what the extra earnings from the lower tax rate, will that change, what we're doing with automation online, fulfillment whatever else and the answer was of course no. We've got more cash than we spend and this will add to that and that's all good, but we're constantly figuring out what other things we can do there. What was the first part of your question? I'm sorry. Edward Kelly : On fuel, if you\u2019re trying to -- yes. Richard Galanti : Well we don't disclose every component, it certainly was the biggest piece of it. Edward Kelly : Okay. In the last quarter you mentioned a little bit of competitive pressure specifically talked about Sam\u2019s and fresh. I am just curious if you could give us an update on the competitive backdrop, what you're seeing? And then you know as part of this it seems like we're starting to see maybe a little bit of food price inflation. Just curious on your thoughts on pass-through I guess and expectations for the year? Richard Galanti : Well, I think the keyword on price inflation is little, we're not seeing other than the tariff impacts on things. But in terms of food what have you, it's frankly very little and some other time it'll go up. Our comments over the years have continually be -- will be the last to go up and the first to go down and I think that holds true as well. In terms of the comment last time on Sam\u2019s that was an entry comment because I think after the call, the headline in the press was is, that's why things -- margins were down. And the fact of the matter is, we call it out because we're pretty transparent, Sam\u2019s and others but Sam\u2019s has been more competitive as we are -- as are we. And that's the nature of the business and it has been for 30 years. We see that continuing and I think the fact that it's continuing we'll still show improvement on some of these things, is a good sign for us. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open. Karen Short : Sorry to harp on this gas margin question, gas profit question. But is there any way you could just help us get a feel for how much you benefited EPS this quarter because the data we saw in gas margins for the quarter throughout your whole market area was just astronomically high gas margins? Richard Galanti : When you say our area, throughout the United States? Karen Short : Well, we map it by kind of stores by state. But west was particularly strong. Richard Galanti : Yes, we don\u2019t disclose that. Again it was a little more than half but not all. Karen Short : And then I guess just wondering a little bit in terms of the wage increase that you called out for March. Is there anything to think about in terms of the basis point impact as we get into the next quarter? Richard Galanti : Yes, I mean that is starting March 4th this past Sunday, I think I indicated. On top of the 7 to 8 that will continue through June 11th if you will. So all through Q3 and the first month of the -- the first four weeks of the 16 weeks fourth quarter effective March 4th we will have that additional on top of that 3 to 4 basis points. And that 3 to 4 basis points will be March 4th to March 3rd of 2020 if you will. Karen Short : 3 to 4 basis point, okay. And then just wondering if you could call anything out in terms of tax refund data, like in terms of your expectations on driving sales and there is a lot of noise on the timeline of that but any color what you are thinking that will do the comp, certain not do I guess? Richard Galanti : Well, honestly I never heard anybody here talk about that and I have read some of the same things that you read, it started off in the period was a little lower and now in the period was a little higher, not a lot higher but a little higher. Typically on a macro basis that impacts retail overall and whatever impact it has on that is typically little less to us. That's what we've seen historically, whether it was a change in tax rates or dividend rates or you name it, EBT, food stamps, whenever there's any kind of macro change that impacts retail across the United States, there's a little bit less of an impact to us. But we've not really seen or even know how to answer that. Karen Short : Okay. And then just last question. I know that you don't want to have people get in the habit of assuming that there will be a special dividend on a regular basis but any thoughts on your philosophy on that as it relates to the timing within this year? Because we're at the two-year mark. Richard Galanti : Yes. I mean, our thoughts continue as they have been. The three we did were about two and a quarter years apart but that doesn't mean anything going forward. It's still a topic on the table and we continue to talk about it along with other things. So, really, not a whole lot of news to tell you about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. John Heinbockel : So, Richard, what are you guys seeing with regard to inbound freight? Is that a slight directional drag? And then, if anything, what are you doing to mitigate that? Richard Galanti : I'm shooting from the hip a little on this one but I believe, while it's been up a little bit because of new restrictions on how many hours long-haulers can drive and just truck capacity out there, it's gone up for everybody, I believe we internally look at it in our freight department as a freight factor or premium factor or fuel factor -- whatever we call it. I forget. And it's up a little less than it was a couple of months ago but it's still up. And it's come down a little bit from where it was but it's still up from a year ago is my guess. John Heinbockel : Okay. And you've had the adjustment item in gross margin related to some supply chain investments, not there now. Is that now gone for the duration or does that come back with other supply chain investments that you might make, whether it's the chicken plant or other depots? Richard Galanti : One of the things was the return centers we talked about for a few quarters. I think there's more things happening that impact us a little bit negatively to start. We opened a new meat plant, major capital expenditure. First, it takes a few things out of our Tracy meat plant that goes to the East Coast. With Tracy, we couldn't accommodate all our needs just from that plant. And then you've got a new plant that's starting with its own -- even though we know how to run one -- it has its innate inefficiencies when you first start and it's not at full capacity. Same thing with the commissary, which was more of a learning experience over the last two years in Canada. I think all these things will impact us. A comment I made earlier is we're not going to point out each one of these but, in the aggregate, my guess is it's still a little bit of a drag which is offset by other things, most particularly sales. John Heinbockel : All right. And then, lastly, there was a period there where you'd stepped up the growth of the business centers for a period of time. What's the philosophy now on where they go, US or internationally, as part of your expansion over the next couple of years? Richard Galanti : I think, right now, we have one in Canada and what? Sixteen in the U.S.? I would expect one or two a year for the next couple of years, which is not really a change of what we thought. The change was several years ago when we went from zero to eight over a million years, over a long period of time, and then we started opening a couple a year. And so we'll continue to open a few but we're not -- it's part of the plan but our focus is regular warehouses and, quite frankly, a lot of the infrastructure things that we're doing now. We'll continue to do it in a bigger way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital. Your line is now open. Scot Ciccarelli : Hi, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Richard, with your first opening in China coming up, what is the best way to think about U.S. versus international store openings over the next, call it, 2-3 years? And then related to that, any reason why we should see international profitability levels decline as you start to move into some of these new markets, like China? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, if you'd asked us five, six, seven years ago, by now, what percentage of our units would be outside of the U.S. and Canada -- and I include Canada as part of the original, mature, fully grown-out area -- that, by now, we'd probably be 50/50 international, outside of the U.S. and Canada. And we're not. It's 65/35, 70/30 U.S./Canada still. Part of that is the opportunities that we've had in the U.S. and Canada. And part of it is the pipeline is taking a little longer elsewhere. I think you'll continue to see that change and the direction is toward more international. But I can't sit here and tell you that it'll be 50/50 three years from now or five years from now. But, clearly, we've got more things going on. Now, as it relates -- whenever we go into a new country, it's almost, by definition, you're going to lose money for the first few years, even if that first location or two contributes a small amount of profitability, if it does. Because you still have the central expense and the whole full thing, the infrastructure. I look back at Japan. When we first went into Japan, we opened six units in the first five years and the goal was to be at breakeven at the end of Year 5 and I think we beat it by about 10 months. But at the end of the day, fast-forward another 10-12 years past those five years, and we now have in the high-20% and we'll grow from there faster and more profitable than it was in that mid-term when we were opening several units on a small base. But it takes time. And as we go into France, as we went into Spain, by definition, those are going to add more to the bottom line sales in that calculation of return on sales and sometimes even subtract a little at the top. The key is balancing a little of that and I think we're big enough now that, even if we overdo it a little bit on some of that new stuff, it's OK. We'll let you know if it costs us an extra basis point or two. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Richard Galanti : Why don't we have two more questions? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Mike Baker : Thank you. A couple of clarifications. One, to Karen Short's question, you said that gas was about half of it. A little more than half or a little less than half of it. Half of what? Was that the year-over-year increase in earnings or operating profit dollars? Richard Galanti : No. First of all, I said it was more than half. I didn't say it was a little over half. It's substantial. But we try not to be that specific. Clearly, there's a lot of things that helped our earnings this quarter year-over-year, as evidenced by improvement in core-on-core. And the fact there's evidence of things that hurt you a little bit. We don't pick out each one. Gas certainly helped but, again, I think Karen had mentioned she's done some studies, in terms of profitability, and it's a good piece of it but it's not entirely. There's other things -- Mike Baker : That's what I'm trying to clarify. Richard Galanti : There's other things that benefited it and other things that hurt it a little too. Mike Baker : It being the growth in earnings? Richard Galanti : Well, gross margin and earnings, ultimately. Mike Baker : Okay. Thank you. Understood. One other question. I thought that you said that the ancillary margins were helped mostly by gas. We get that. But you also said helped by e-commerce. So, are your e-commerce margins getting better year-over-year? And, if so, why is that? Richard Galanti : I believe the e-commerce bottom-line margin improved a little but also the sales were stronger than the rest of the company. So, it's penetration as well. Mike Baker : Okay. Understood. Last, real quick, SNAP. Any benefit from the pull-forward in SNAP? I don't know how much of it is your customer but it's helped others. Richard Galanti : No, we really don't see any of that. Very little of it. Those kind of things don't really impact us. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Scott Mushkin : Hey, Richard, thanks for taking my questions. So, I just want to go back to e-commerce. I know you touched on it, in the quarter, that it was a little helpful to margins. But you're putting a lot of money into it, it sounds like, with two-day and one-day grocery. I was wondering if you could walk us forward on e-commerce and what you think it's going to do to margins as you go forward. Richard Galanti : Well, every company allocates things or puts things in different silos. In our e-commerce, the one-day grocery is not part of e-commerce. Even though you go online to order, it's really the Instacart engine and it's in warehouse. They come into our warehouses, they shop, they deliver the same day. And so that's part of the e-commerce numbers. That and a couple of other things would actually increase the percentage increases a little bit but it's still so small, it wouldn't have that much of an impact. Scott Mushkin : And then the rest of the e-commerce business? I think you said you were building out some fulfillment for e-commerce. I think it's for more consumables. How are you guys thinking about margins on that business as we move forward because the mix is going to shift, I think? Richard Galanti : Well, it has shifted. As you know, a few years ago, the average ticket was $400 or something because we sold big ticket items. We didn't have lots of little things or things that got you back to the site more frequently and more regularly. Some of that's just starting. As I talked about, the first of three planned fulfillment -- what we are calling fulfillment automation centers, we have our first one in southern California. It's literally open less than eight weeks, I believe. It's over a $100 million investment. The first one is the most expensive because you developed all the systems and everything as well. We have two other planned for depots in other parts of the country. I would hope that that's something that's going to hit our number a little bit because it means we're doing well in it as we're growing it. We're going to see the cost of picking an item dramatically reduce because we've done it not quite manually but less automated than we'll do over time. But that's going to be an ebb and flow over time. We'll just see how it goes. I think, in the scheme of things, recognizing that e-commerce, in its entirety is still, what, 5% to 6% of our business? 5% plus of our business? Even as we hope and assume that it's going to grow at a higher rate than the rest of the company, it's still going to be in the single digits for a while. So, those impacts -- and even with the first one, you're talking about the inefficiencies of getting something open up and running and building it up over the first 6-12 months and then the associated depreciation and the like. Those things, in the scheme of things, are not huge. As we do three and four and five of them, it's a little bigger. So is one chicken plant, so is one new concept bakery commissary a few years ago. So, all these things will be -- I would think these are things, we'll hope to balance some of them, but net-net, if they're a little drag, that's a positive. Scott Mushkin : All right. And then last one. I guess this is the last question. But February sales and traffic, anything to read there? It seems like it was a little slower than we've been seeing. Any thoughts there? Any read? Richard Galanti : No, look, I think we, more than anybody, hate to use the word \"weather\" as a reason. And you see it every day. Clearly, whether it was rain, snow, cold, you name it, that impacts things like patio furniture, spring wear. But I think if you ex out the things we try to, as I pointed out on the call, if you ex out the weather, which we assume -- I think I said it was 1% in the month for the full company. A little more, therefore, in the US and Canada. We try to err to the conservative assumption on that. I mean, it's not a lot more than that but we feel comfortable in talking to the operators of the impact. And if you add that back in and you add the holiday shift in Asia, you take those things out, we're a little lower, not a lot lower, than we've been enjoying for the last several months. I guess we'll have to wait and see how March is. Scott Mushkin : See how March is. Exactly. All right. Well, thank you so much and take care. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Thank you, Vincent, and we'll be around to answer questions. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jerome, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to hand the call over to Mr. Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, the floor is yours. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Jerome, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today\u2019s press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the 12 weeks ended May 12th. Our reported net income for the quarter came in at $906 million or $2.05 per share. This compared to $750 million or $1.70 per share last year. As mentioned in the release this year's third quarter benefited from a nonrecurring tax item of $73 million or $0.16 per share. Excluding this item, earnings for the fiscal third quarter were up 11% year-over-year. Net sales for the quarter came in at $33.96 billion, a 7.4% increase over the $31.62 billion sales figure last year and the quarter. Comparable sales for the third quarter were as follows. For the 12 weeks on a reported basis U.S. was 7.0%. Excluding gas inflation, FX and rev rec it was seven -- it would have been a 5.5%. Canada reported at a 1.3%, ex those items, a 5.1% positive. Other International reported 1.7%; ex those items a 6.9% to the positive. So total company we reported a 5.5% comp sales figure for the 12 weeks. Excluding those three items almost negated each other coming in at 5.6% excluding those items. E-commerce was 22% for the quarter on a reported basis and 19.5% ex those items. In terms of Q3 comp sales, our third quarter traffic or shopping frequency increased by 3.7% worldwide and up 3.4% in the U.S. In terms of the impact of the items of gas, FX and rev rec, weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by about 130 basis points. Gasoline price inflation impacted sales by a small amount plus 10 basis points and rev rec benefited comp sales by about 110 basis points. So the net of the three about a minus 10 basis points. Our average front-end transaction or ticket was up 1.8% during the third quarter. And excluding the impacts from gas, FX and rev rec, our average ticket was up approximately 1.9%. Next on the income statement membership fee income. We reported membership income in the third quarter of $776 million or 2.29% of sales. This is up $39 million or 5.3% from last year's $737 million. FX had a negative impact on that number that impacted the $39 million increase would have been about just under $10 million higher than that ex-FX. Our reported membership fee revenue again was up to $39 million or 5.3%. In addition to FX impacting that to the negative it does have the benefit of the fee increases we took almost two years ago. Really the last fiscal quarter of that those increases that we took in June of 2017 in the U.S. and Canada. We now have effectively completed that 23-month cycle that takes to recognize the incremental benefit from the fee increases. The benefit to our P&L in Q4 will be very small less than $1 million. In terms of renewal rates, at Q3 end, our membership rates -- renewal rates remain strong. In the U.S. and Canada membership renewal rates came in at 90.7% the same as it was a quarter ago. And worldwide the rate was 88.3%. That figure also the same as of Q2 end. In terms of the number of members at Q3 end, the number of member households we had was 53.1 million at Q3 end, that's up from 52.7 million 12 weeks earlier. In terms of total cardholders, we came in at 97.2 million, up from 96.3 million 12 weeks earlier at Q2 end. During the quarter, we opened three new warehouses one each in the United States, Korea, and Australia. At Q3 end in terms of paid Executive members, they stood at 20.4 million which was an increase of 406,000 during the quarter or 34,000 per week. Korea was actually a very small piece of that increase, so we've had a good continued increases in Executive Member penetration in other countries as well, most notably U.S. and Canada. Going down the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the third quarter was lower year-over-year by six basis points coming in at 10.99% versus last year's 11.05%. Now, excluding the items that I've excluded before FX rev rec and the like the six basis point lower number would be actually plus five basis points excluding gas inflation and rev rec. If I ask you to jot down a couple of numbers here, two columns both reported and an ex-gas inflation and revenue recognition for the third quarter of 2019 as compared to a year earlier. The first line item here would be core merchandise. On a reported basis year-over-year in the quarter it was reported one basis point lower. Ex-gas and rev rec it was nine basis points positive; ancillary businesses minus three and minus one basis point; 2% reward, minus two and minus three. And something [along those lines] [ph] you'd have the reported number six basis points lower and ex-gas and rev rec five basis points higher. One thing you all note compared to last -- the second quarter, in the second quarter we had a big increase in ancillary business margin as we pointed out last quarter's earnings release. The core merchandise component here again lower by one basis point. If you look at the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales core-on-core if you will margins year-over-year were higher in Q3 year-over-year by 21 basis points. The subcategories within the quarter all four named subcategories food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods were all up year-over-year in the third quarter on their own sales. And that's a trend that we've seen last quarter. It was up less than that amount in Q1, down a little bit year-over-year. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin again lower by one basis point on the ex-gas and rev rec. Nothing really to speak off in terms of things there. Moving to SG&A. Our SG&A percentage Q3-over-Q3 was lower or better by six basis points coming in at 9.92% of sales this year. This compares to 9.98% reported last year. Ex gas inflation and rev rec it was higher or slightly worse by five basis points. Again to jot down a few numbers here in the two columns. Reported in the second column without gas inflation and rev rec gas inflation and rev rec. Our core operations on a reported basis was better by seven basis points so plus seven. Ex rev rec minus two. Central, minus one and minus two basis points. Stock compensation zero and minus one. Summing up those two columns, again on a reported basis SG&A was lower or better by plus six basis points and ex those other items worse by five basis points. Now the key thing here is within the seven basis points of improvement or rather the minus two basis points ex gas and rev rec, that\u2019s notwithstanding the fact that we're still facing pretty big headwinds from the U.S. wage increases to our hourly employees that went into effect in June of 2018 as well as additional wage increases implemented in March of 2019. Both of these wage increases negatively impacted SG&A during the quarter, representing about 10 to 12 basis points of the year-over-year variance. In Q4, the estimated impact will be about minus five to six basis points, which is the residual impact from June of 2018 plus the March 2019 increases. And then we'll tick down to three to four basis points and that's what we estimate in Q1 of 2020. Central, nothing to speak out there. It was higher by two basis points on an ex gas and rev rec basis. Stock compensation flat year-over-year and then [again] [ph] minus one. Next on the income statement is preopening expense. Preopening expense came in at $14 million this year into Q3, up $6 million from a year ago. We have one additional opening, three opening this year versus two last year. There was also about $2 million of preopening expense in the number related to the chicken plant that we plan to start at the beginning of production in later this summer. Additionally some of these quarters expense relates to our higher number of openings we have in Q4 in Qs one through three in the first 36 weeks of this year, we will open a total of 10 new locations in Q4 we have 11 planned. So there was some remnants in the beginning of some of the preopening there. All told, reported operating income in Q3 was up 5% coming in at $1,122 million this year, compared to $1,067 million last year. Below the operating income line reported interest expense was $2 million lower or better year-over-year coming in at $35 million versus $37 million. That's just a slight difference in capitalized interest amounts. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $5 million year-over-year. Interest income itself was actually higher by $11 million year-over-year. However, various FX items in the amount of a minus $16 million negatively impacted the year-over-year comparison. Overall pre-tax income in Q3 was also up 5% coming in at $1,123 million this year versus $1,071 million last year. In terms of income taxes, our reported tax rate in Q3 of fiscal 2019 was 18.5%, compared to 28.8% in Q3 last year. As was mentioned in today's release this quarter's earnings and our tax rate benefited from a nonrecurring $73 million item. Excluding the $73 million item, our third quarter tax rate would have been 24.9%. We estimate that our effective total company tax rate for fiscal Q4 of fiscal 2019 to be more in the 26.5% to 27% range. A few other items of note. In terms of expansion, as I mentioned, we've opened through the third quarter to-date a total of -- actually opened 12 units -- I'm sorry opened 13 units, but that includes three relocations and so net of 10. In Q4, we'll open 13 locations which includes two relos, so net of 11 which should put us in terms of net new openings for the fiscal year at 21, the same number that we had in fiscal 2018. About three quarters of the openings this year are in the U.S. and about quarter internationally. This also includes our anticipation of opening our first Costco in China, in Shanghai tentatively scheduled to open on August 27th right before the fiscal year ends. As of Q3 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 112 million square feet. In terms of CapEx, while our new warehouse openings remains in the low 20s, the CapEx then is in line with prior years. Excuse me; it's in line with prior years. We've got a lot of money being spent on fulfillment, both e-commerce and grocery expansion and automation, the chicken plant which is what we mentioned; as well as ongoing expansion and depot infrastructure as well as IT modernization. In terms of stock buybacks in Q3, during the third quarter, we expended $44 million repurchasing 192,000 shares at an average price of $226.57. To-date we've expended $195 million or 903,000 shares at about a $216 per share price. As a reminder, the last Board meeting, the Board approved the reauthorization of a stock repurchase program. They authorized a new $4 billion program that will remain in effect through April 2023. In terms of e-commerce, overall our e-commerce sales increased as we mentioned in a comp basis 19.5%; reported 22%; 19.5% ex-FX and gas. I might point out by the way that these numbers do not include the increases that we're seeing with Instacart. Instacart comes into our warehouses and purchases and that goes into warehouse sales. The top growth categories in the quarter were electronics, health and beauty aids, furniture, small appliances, automotive, and optical. And new brands and items online during the quarter include high end televisions from Sony and Samsung as well as the latest generation of Apple products from AirPods to iMax and the like. Other things will include things like bare minerals beauty cosmetics. Sales highlights for the quarter included some significant diamond repurchases one in the $400,000 range and big-ticket items like golf simulators that sold for $14,000 each which we sold during the fine pay period. We also continue to improve our online and in-line cross marketing initiatives. A lot of push notifications for start and end of warehouse promotions. E-mails featuring hot items and suggestions for Mother's Day and other holidays like Cinco de Mayo. During the quarter, we also completed the rollout of six regional grocery distribution centers located within our existing depots. You'll recall that previously we had fulfilled since late 2017 when we began the two-day grocery, we did that through our business centers. As it expands, we pushed into our depot operations and we'll also have in those cases regional assortments. An update on in terms of our buying online and pick up in store, in the quarter, we began rolling out additional pickup lockers. Over the last several months we've had been locations, but we're in the process of rolling that out to one additional 100 locations over the next four or five months before the September through December holiday season. Continued growth in Costco app use among our members. We continue to experience that with new features recently added like pharmacy orders and pick up notifications, easier shopping ability on member savings events, photo center, and various push notifications and expect several additional new features are planned for July in the upcoming months thereafter. We continue to focus on getting merchandise to customers faster. Some of that has to do with where we locate the merchandise in these depot and other ancillary operations. As discussed last quarter, we will begin e-commerce operations in Japan later this summer; and Australia late summer early fall. Next thing I want to touch on for a minute is the whole question of tariffs. I'm sure we'll be getting some questions on that, so a few comments. As we indicated a couple of quarters ago in our earnings release, there continue to be a lot of moving parts, although some of the moving parts are getting bigger and but it is still pretty fluid. The actions that we took then and we continue to take where we're able to -- not in a big way we're accelerating shipments before certain tariffs we pull into effect or will be increased as a percentage of the tariffs although there is limited ability to do that. We worked with suppliers. We've gotten to potentially every supplier on every item as you might expect to see what we can do to both reduce cost and figure out how to do that. In some cases, we've reduced order commitments on certain items. We look at alternative country sourcing where possible and feasible, although again, there's a limited amount of the ability to do that. And we've taken advantage of lower pricing on certain U.S. items that have been impacted the other way. In summary, we'll continue to see our customers competitors react to this. What's interesting is if you -- as you know this list three which is the biggest of the three lists of potential tariff items, those were listed back in September of 2018 at 10% tariffs and we're going to go to 25% at December -- as of December 31st of 2018. That data continue to move although it's now moved into its in fact it 25% for items that I believe are exported after meeting. So we're just starting to see some of those impacts. As you might expect it's all over the Board in terms of every activity of the vendor is different. In some cases, it's being passed on. In some cases, we're able to work to figure out how to move merchandise and then the impact of when the price increase does go through. It has a different impact of how it affects sales. We think that we are in a good position in terms of our size and our ability and our relationships with our vendors and we'll keep you posted how it goes. This last piece that again includes -- it's the biggest list of the three lists and includes things like furniture, luggage, banks, vacuums, gross, and more items like that. That's pretty much it on our side. And lastly in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending this Sunday June 2nd, next Wednesday June 5th after the market closes. And with that I will open it up for Q&A and turn it back to Jerome. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Now, our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael, you are now live. Michael Lasser : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Richard, how are you going to comp the $400,000 diamond ring? It's going to be tough next year. Richard Galanti : Well, do you have an anniversary coming up. Michael Lasser : Even if I did, I can't afford it. My question relates to the comp. The traffic\u2019s been moderating a bit, should we think about this as just more reversion to the mean? Or do you think that there's something else going on? Richard Galanti : Well, look every time it reminds me of a few years ago when we saw a slight moderation in traffic and it was, oh my God, this is the new normal. And our answered then was we don't know what the -- we don't know if it is or it isn't. What we know is we've got a lot of exciting things going on in buying. We certainly -- the different buckets of money we talked about over the last few years whether it's the fee income for membership fee increases, the credit cards switch, the tax reform, all those things don't go away. They in fact grow each year a little bit. And so I think that we feel that we're in a good position to keep driving it. As it relates to where it goes from here, we'll have to see. We think relatively speaking our value proposition is as strong if not stronger than it\u2019s ever been out there. And we'll have to see where it goes. Now what are some of the headwinds? Recent headwinds included the weather and other things that started back in February. Certainly this new word with a capital T called Tariff there's questions out there that we read about every day and we\u2019ll see. Again we feel whatever the impact is, we feel that in the earlier tariffs last year, recognizing many of them were in the 10% range not a 25% range, we actually felt we picked up a little market share in some cases. We don't know what will happen tomorrow, but we feel we're in a good position from a buying power standpoint and certainly have the ability to drive sales the way we know how to do it with good value. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is your core-on-core gross margin expanded rate that accelerate quite a bit from the last couple of quarters. Is that because of what you are doing proactively? Or is it just that the market becoming a little less competitive and as a result you're able to earn a little bit more in your sales? Richard Galanti : I think it's a little of everything. I think some of its internal controls. We still manage the basics, managing spoilage and D&D, and negotiating with vendors. It's a lot easier to do that. Our buying power, and our strength per item is enormous given our $150 billion is over 4,000 given items at a given time. Certainly I get back to some of those other buckets we've had available. We're able to use those and we're able to -- we've also been able to show that we drive even greater value. We -- the vendor sees a big increase in pick up in the unit sales and I think that's worked in our benefit. Michael Lasser : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Edward, you are now live. Edward Kelly : Yeah, hi Richard. I wanted to ask you about margins. Just the performance on the core margin and then the core-on-core, which obviously was even better. Any additional color on the puts and takes there? And then how we should maybe be thinking about that for the remainder of the year particularly as tariff starts to accelerate? Richard Galanti : Well, I mean, look when \u2013 we've obviously been asked when prices are going up, when cost are going up we want to be the last to raise them. And when prices are going down we want to be the first to lower them. We're not afraid to use some of those monies to again drive business. I think a lot of things worked in our favor this quarter. Just when you get comfortable with us we'll do something else, right? But there's -- again we don't really give -- provide direction or guidance on where it will go in the future. We feel pretty good right now about our competitive position relative to both in line and online and the value proposition that we bring. In fact, some of the weakness whether it's tariff related or whatever it's related, in some cases, we feel that it gives us a leg up as it relates to we can go in there and buy large quantities of something at great value. And these are all anecdotal comments though. Overall, we feel again good about our competitive position and the things that we have in the pipeline as it relates to having good - great merchandise and great prices. Edward Kelly : And just maybe a follow-up on the tariff side. As we think about this three and we think about 25% your philosophy I guess generally you've always been a bit more of a customer-first organization. Is there a margin risk associated with that? And then as we think about any potential for list four, how strategically would you think about that? Richard Galanti : Well, there's always risk. At some point, you can't [indiscernible] all these tariffs. We work with vendors. There's been some switching a small amount of switching to other countries of origin where we can, although we're not the only one in town trying to do that. At the end of the day prices will go up on things. What's interesting is that it's hard to predict what the impact is. We've seen strengthened patio furniture even with certain tariff price increases although part of that is because there was a little bit of slowdown in patio furniture because of the bad weather in January, February and we get into seasons early. So, again, it's hard to analyze each one. I think what we're most cognizant of is a key price point. If you're something at $9.99, you hate to go to a new calculation that was at $10.49. But if it's 25% on $9.99, needless to say you're not worried about $10.49 you've got to figure out where it is above that. And again I think we've done everything we can and we'll see where it goes from here. And then the real unknown is how long it's going to last. And to the extent it gets into list four, that's a whole new ballgame as well. That's the rest of everything, if you will, including electronics and apparel and the phones and televisions. And so the more discretionary item is we were -- again I think a little conservatively surprised on the patio side, although we also have to recognize there were some build up because the weather. It took a little bit while for the weather to turn. And -- but if you start getting 25% tariffs on that list four, the list four is not here yet. And we're hopeful that the ebbs and flows of the relations between our countries improves in that regard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, Josh Kamboj : Hi, this is Josh Kamboj joined for Simeon. Thank you for taking our question. The expense leverage that you saw in the quarter was encouraging especially against the wage headwinds that you're facing. Can you maybe go into a little bit more detail about what's driving those specifically? And then ignoring the benefit from lapping that wage increase next year, can you continue to drive expense leverage in the same areas for the foreseeable future to offset tariffs? Richard Galanti : Look the biggest \u2013 depending on the level of tariffs, if it's lot, no. But as we've always said, we're \u2013 the biggest thing is driving sales. If we can drive sales, we're not very good at leveraging expenses of sales or weakening relative to others perhaps because there are things we're not going to do. We're not going to postpone a wage increase and things like that. And we work on expenses every day and every week and every month at our budget meetings literally, and I think we \u2013 again, there will be a little reduced headwind in each of the next few quarters with the big increase as we saw an hourly wages both in June of 2017 and now in March \u2013 sorry in June of 2018 and now in March of 2019 as those \u2013 that 10 to 12 negative goes to six or seven goes to four or five or whatever I said earlier. Beyond that, there's also \u2013 I mean, there is basis points here and there that go both ways. A lot of the things we're doing like this \u2013 the new fulfillment centers, the automation, none of this stuff goes completely smoothly. And we don't point out each one of these things, but I'm sure there's some extra hits of half basis points here and half points there and there is other things that improve. At the end of the day sales is paramount. The other thing is that as \u2013 I think not over this next year, but over the next several years to the extent that we have a higher increase of openings outside the United States that tends to help the overall percentages on things like health care. Health care is 30 to 70 basis points higher in every other country than in the U.S. things like that. And so \u2013 I'm sorry, lower, health care expense as a percent of sales is lower in every other country outside the United States. So there is \u2013 we've been fortunate that our comps [after works] [ph] and virtually every other country we've gone to take some time, it takes a few years to get there, when we first opened in a country. But at the end of the day that will help. And that's not going to help tomorrow. That's over the next 5 and 10 years. Josh Kamboj : Okay. Thank you. And Just as a quick follow-up following up on some of the other questions a little bit more directly. Do you think over the next few quarters your merch margin can continue to expand if it's the core-on-core one as tariffs have greater impact on your business? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, we don't guide. That's why \u2013 I should say stop. But look tariffs to the extent that we want to be the last to raise prices, it doesn't mean we're going to wait and not do it at all. We've had to be pragmatic about it, but net-net those that would be a drag a little bit of a drag. Now hopefully, it's a grab from a plus \u2013 a drag from a plus 20 not a minus 5. Josh Kamboj : Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC market. Scot, you are now live. Scot Ciccarelli : Good afternoon, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. I was curious, if you guys have considered providing a quick-and-collect kind of process for your grocery offering given the success that Walmart had with their grocery pickup? Richard Galanti : Not at this juncture. I mean, the click and collect that we're doing is simply \u2013 as more for small size big-ticket items like electronics and jewelry and handbags. We continue to look at it. We continue to scratch our heads about it. We recognize that they and some others are putting in a lot of financial commitment to doing this. I think what you're going to find is like everything else in life at Costco over time we figure out how to do it our way that makes sense for us that still works. One of the reasons that whether it's Instacart or a smaller scale shipped in the Southeast, which is growing its geographic footprint as well as Google, all those things are ways to do that without us having to get into that business in a big way. And that's on two-day. And recognizing if somebody wants something in an hour, they're probably not going to get it from us. But what we see is \u2013 the other thing is we still want to drive into the warehouse, and so far what we see in small bite-size this year and some of the things we've done, the net of having that one-day grocery with third parties or two-day drag grocery through us, it has been slightly additive. So it's not cannibalizing -- well it cannibalizes the number of business to our warehouse a little, some of the -- still is an increase in sales. These are small data points over a short period of time, so we have to see it. But we'll figure out how to keep doing it our way and hopefully that will work. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. So, really nothing in the near future. Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Chuck, you are now live. Chuck Grom : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks. Richard, just in light of the trade war, rhetoric and market volatility and some of the concerns, I\u2019m just wondering if you've seen any change in the consumer behavior particularly in some of your more important market such as California. PVH was out saying some things last night. Curious if you're seeing anything on your consumer? Richard Galanti : No. We really haven't. Chuck Grom : No? Okay, great. And just thinking on Ed\u2019s question about operating margins, they are much stronger than a decade ago. And frankly not many in retail can say that. I\u2019m just curious when you look ahead, you think bigger picture about some of the puts and takes what do you think about operating margin dollar growth in the future? Richard Galanti : I guess, more, more. The slides that has been shown at our international managers meeting every year for that three or four-day event from the beginning of time and through Craig Jelinek's tenure over the last eight years, we're a top line company. And as long as we can keep driving sales all those other things fall into place. The fact that we have been successful longer than I thought and continuing to get more people to convert to Executive Membership, the benefit that we have with great value on a credit card, all those things drive loyalty and will drive sales and everything else will take care of itself. And we feel pretty comfortable right now with the recognizing the value is not just price, the price is still the biggest piece of value on what we do. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Mandeville from Jefferies. Christopher, you are now live. Christopher Mandeville : Hi, good evening. Can I just ask in terms of competition on the consumable side, are you seeing anything notable in terms of change on pricing, whether it be greater aggression or maybe a greater willingness to pass on overall cost inflation? And I guess I am definitely curious about categories like eggs and pork where we've seen some significant deviations on pricing? Richard Galanti : I mean, pork has been over the board as I understand. But overall \u2013 the answer to your overall question is not really. If anything, I mean using gasoline as an extreme example, I think the fact that our -- most gasoline retailers have been willing to make more on gas and has enabled us to have a bigger value GAAP and make a little more. And so that suited us well. Again I think we're fortunate that many of the price wars are out there, the traditional retailers at any given category are impacting a lot more than we are on those things. So that's -- I think we've been fortunate. And on basics, what I call the supermarket ads of yesteryears, we've been watching those every week since the beginning of time and continue to do so. And where we helped ourselves is in areas of private label and areas of organic and specialty items. I mean you go into even something as basic as cheeses. We're not just selling to basics cheeses anymore. We're selling premium cheeses. And I think in everything we do and packaged food items, we stepped up the quality and whether it's organic or antibiotic free or you name it. And those things we're able to show a to show a great savings and still maintain a decent margin. Christopher Mandeville : Okay. And you brought up fuel. I guess I'm curious that the comments on being able to capture maybe a little bit more margin all while expanding the gap relative to competition. Is that broad-based across the country? Or is it more so confined to areas like state of California? And then can you just speak to growth on gallons in the quarter? Richard Galanti : As I understand it the only geographic region in the U.S. where that's not the case is parts of the Midwest and it ebbs and flows there. Everywhere else it's been pretty healthy for us. And I think the gas -- the value gas when you look at some of these third-party websites that collect from millions of people across the country on pricing, we continue to be shown as the best value out there. Christopher Mandeville : And anything on the comps for gallon growth? Richard Galanti : They continue to be in the -- I believe they're still in the high single digits in gallons. Yes, they continue in this quarter to be in the high single digits, whereas I think U.S. gallon consumption is in the low single digits. We're driving people into the parking lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Karen you are now live. Karen Short : I'm wondering -- on core growth margin is there any benefit to core-on-core maybe from timing in terms of accelerating delivery of items that may be passing on some price increases because -- I mean it sounds like it could be a little more structural in nature although, I know you don't really want to commit to that? And then I had another question. Richard Galanti : Not really because in our mobility we kept of the cost down. Even as costs went up and we had it sooner we held it off. We held off raising price until we were into a higher cost unit or product. Karen Short : Okay. And then I guess then that would lead us to think that there may be something more structural in terms of what we saw on core-on-core? Or are you reluctant to go down that path? Richard Galanti : Look. Again I guess, I choose to use the world that we try to be pragmatic about it. We didn't look back two quarters ago and say core-on-core was down five or six basis points year-over-year and then last quarter it was up seven or eight or whatever we reported and now it's up 20. We didn't strategically plan to do with like that. It's our buying power. I think in some of these weak times in certain categories, apparel is an example. We can go in and buy huge quantities of something where the manufacturer's volumes have been cut by other merchants and really drive great value and people love it and even give even a greater value to the customer. The private label is a little bit -- product mix is a little bit. Certainly private label is a little of it. Karen Short : Okay. And then if we get -- if list four does get implemented, what percent is actually imported from China in totality? Or what will be the increase on what's imported directly from China? Or do you just have no way of calculating that really? Richard Galanti : There's really not an easy way to calculate it. First of all, list four is somewhat titled everything else, but who knows what everything else is once it goes through that few months' process of exceptions and people appealing the process. And look it's more significant in the sense that there's some categories that are arguably discretionary in nature. Apparel to some extent, electronics certainly, and more people put that off. Again getting back to patio furniture, we didn't see it, although, we believe part of that is related to just the season starting a little later this year. Karen Short : Okay. And then just last question from me. I think testing self-check-out in some stores, maybe can you just give an update on how many stores that's been? And then any color on what you're seeing with respect to traffic in those stores where that's been rolled out? Richard Galanti : Of the 540-ish locations in the U. S. it's in about 125, we're going to move to 250 in rapid order over the next several months. It works -- by the way for us it works best in high-volume locations where it's got a lot easier, particularly if you have a credit card now where you can just contactless. And it's very fast and customers are using it. Our members are using it. And it's saving some labor at the front end. As important, on the highest volume units, it's getting people through the front end faster which we recognize when you get -- if our average unit is in the 180, 190 range they get a lot of units in the 250 to 350 range that helps. Karen Short : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Melich from Evercore ISI. Gregory, you're now live. Gregory Melich : Hi thanks. Richard can you give us a little more on the e-commerce front? Specifically, is it still more profitable from a margin standpoint than retail globally? And how could that change as you know roll out into Japan and Australia, how should we think about that? Richard Galanti : Well, keep in mind U.S. doors everybody else Canada doors everybody else to some extent portion to the size of our company. Overall, it's more profitable recognizing we don't charge back every item. There's a charge that the warehouse gets for accepting merchandise and things like that. At the end of the day, it's -- we think it's slightly more profitable at a lower gross margin. And there's certain categories like -- I mean the most notable one is white goods. Four years ago in the U.S., we did maybe 50 million in limited amount of white good sales, meaning refrigerators, washers, and dryers and the like. Now, we display a few items in-store in three \u2013 go out three fiscal years, which was last year's fiscal 2018, we did 50 something, 500-plus, a little over $500 million, and that should be \u2013 we should be able to double that to go over $700 million this year. So double that in a few years. So that's a category that by necessity nobody was going to go pick it up buy in and pick it up anywhere else anymore. And this has enabled us to have \u2013 so there is those kinds of things that have helped as well, where we would have lost some of that business, I think over time in the warehouse anyway. Patio Furniture or -- Patio Furniture during the 12 weeks to 16 weeks in the January through April period, predominantly and regular furniture during the kind of after Memorial Day and before back-to-school during the 10 or so weeks in the middle of summer, that's when we sold that stuff. Now, we sell some of that stuff year-round online most notably Patio Furniture that we sell year-round in decent amount in geographies where the sun actually shines more often. Gregory Melich : Got it. And so is it fair to say that still that e-commerce business is very general merchandise-heavy? And can you update us on what vendor direct is as a percentage of that business or just \u2013 and how big it is as a percent of sales? Richard Galanti : Well, vendor direct, yeah. When we first started years ago, it was mostly all vendor direct, because it was big ticket. It was solely big-ticket items being shipped \u2013 drop shipped. That's a lot of smaller percentage today than it's ever been. First of all, in addition over the last few years, where we have gone as to, one, improve the site greatly itself, whether its search, returns, you name it. But we've added categories to create more velocity and more reasons for you some of you to think about the going to costco.com, whether its health and beauty aids or food and sundries and things like that. And so I think you'll see that continue, one of the reasons that we're doing some of these automation fulfillment for small packages. If you will and that's the natural progression of how we do things. And I was reading an article just this morning about \u2013 the writer was suggesting a small percentage of our members shop online at Costco. That's in this small relative to others, but it's increased each year and has increasing at a greater level now. And we're getting better at it. But again, we still want to use the Internet to get to the end of the store as well, and we think we done a pretty good job of both of those. Gregory Melich : Great. And just a clarification on the tariffs, it sounds like \u2013 if just pick a number let's say 15% a year COGS came from China. List three would be less than half of that and list four theoretically would be bigger if it went on everything it. Is that fair? Richard Galanti : List four would be -- yes absolutely. Gregory Melich : Yeah. Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. Good luck. Richard Galanti : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. John, you are now live. John Heinbockel : So Richard, let me start with the sequential improvement in core-on-core, I'll beat that horse again. Is that fairly broad based right the 8 to the 21? And then secondly, I don't think you guys don't spend a lot of time thinking about item-by-item elasticity or do you? And a real good sense where \u2013 where the \u2013 where some of that can be given back productively? Richard Galanti : Right. It is broad-based and we certainly do not think a lot about price elasticity. Are there \u2013 well, we think about price elasticity in one direction, if we lower the price where we sell more, and you know, if you think back John a couple \u2013 two or three years ago when we restructured the MVM, which had worked well in group sequentially over 15 years -- plus years and it was a little stale. And so we changed it up a few items of greater values each. And what we found is on some cases it worked, and on some cases it didn't. But I don't think we ever think about what if we raised the price and sell 2% less units. John Heinbockel : Yeah, I'm thinking more on the -- if we cut the price, if we were invest some of our core-on-core benefit, can we get more share or we're just pushing on the strengths? Richard Galanti : We do that. And I think we tried the most extreme example of saying can we drive more value out of more volume. And if we can't, we don't stubbornly push on a string in every case. John Heinbockel : All right. And then secondly, where do you think we stand gross and net openings for next year right? So I know you probably have wanted to get up both of those right. Gross openings probably in the high 20s and maybe a you get a bit higher than it's been. And obviously you open Shanghai, but what's going on with China? Does that give you any pause for additional openings beyond Shanghai? Or no you're still looking for real estate? Richard Galanti : Well, at this juncture we have two locations, one we're opening this late summer, and one that we will -- if all things go well about a year almost two years from now. So I should say 1.5 years plus after the first one opens. That's not that different than what we've done in other countries. I think in Australia we opened three over the first four years. I think in Japan we opened five. We opened actually six over five years, in Spain we open two over four years. So that's not inconsistent. We'll continue; when they're there, Craig and real estate guys and Jim Murphy, the Head of International and the local country managers, they're looking at other sites. But right now we want to get to -- look China's a little unique in many ways aside from any issues right now with tariffs. That's not hopefully a long-term issue. Each item has to be registered separately. We're fortunate in the sense that we have a successful operation in Taiwan, which we were able to bring some key people. But we want to hire from within and like we do in other countries start with a very small core group of people that are expats but really growing internally. And if it's also -- what we said is if new country's very successful, we're perfectly happy to have a couple of units over the first two or three years and four or five total units, four or five years after we opened our first, we'll go from there. John Heinbockel : And your thoughts on opening this coming year? Richard Galanti : Excuse me? John Heinbockel : This coming year, 2019 or August of 2020, early thoughts on gross and net? Where would that goes to this year? Richard Galanti : Yeah, I think the next year we\u2019ll look about the same amount as this year. John Heinbockel : All right. So like mid-20s growth and low 20s net? Richard Galanti : Yes. John Heinbockel : Okay. All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Scott. You are now live. Scott Mushkin : Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. I got two questions. Richard, you talked about driving top line sales and that's the key \u2013 the company everything else takes care of itself. And if you look back over the last I guess five years did a huge expansion, even blew out a number of centers to add to the fresh, so I think that helped a lot. The credit card helped a lot. When you look out over the next year or two or three, what do you see pretty substantial? What do you see as similar type of sales drivers potential? Richard Galanti : Well I think we continue to see - first of all I think fresh foods is -- continues to evolve and grow. Specialty items within both food and nonfood; organic, both fresh and shelf stable one of the think that's again -- the good news in my view is a lot of these -- there's lots of different things not one giant thing. We continue to add gas stations in other countries besides U.S. and Canada. It works. E-commerce as I mentioned, we added to two more countries this year. All those things add on each other. One of the things that we historically have not done a lot and again this is not a game changer overnight in terms of our performance is, we're very -- we've been very good at taking items in the U.S. and bringing them elsewhere and maybe to a small extent some Canadian items because of the size that were up there. We've been bringing and continuing to test items that we find in other countries that are high end specialty unique items and we're getting some success with that. It's a small thing right now, but we're very good at figuring out how to do that and taking it to the next step. So I think you and I continue to -- we're merchants and we're the best price. And I think that's more than anything what you'll see with us. I think we're doing a better job on the membership site in terms of converting people to executive. We're still seeing good sign-ups with the credit card. And as those rewards get bigger we believe that number becomes even more loyal. So I think we continue to see -- the good news is that concerns that many of you have had over the years and we haven't moved fast enough in certain areas whether it's internet or e-commerce there's a lot of low-hanging fruit out there and we're benefiting from some of that. So I got to tell you I come to every -- I go to every budget meeting and you hear the merchants or the merchants from some of the other countries talk about some of the things that we're doing. I think that's exciting. We're now in a size from a value proposition, there's certain both high-volume Kirkland items and paper goods and the like order where we're now in the size where we can produce them in another country at the same quality level and dramatically lower in freight cost. Now this is not across the board on everything, but there's lots of those types of opportunities that we continue to do. There's not a shortage of things to stay busy trying to drive our business around here that we feel pretty good about. Scott Mushkin : Perfect. And then my follow-up question really goes to the competitive climate. And we're seeing that may be one of your competitors -- biggest competitors is kind of tacked a little bit differently. Maybe they were investing a lot in price a year ago and not so much now. Is that part of what's going on with the core-on-core gross margins? Is it the competitive climate is just a little bit easier? Richard Galanti : It's really across the board with traditional retailer as well. One of the things that I mentioned on the last few quarters because on this side -- on the fresh side they become and continue to be more competitive than they have been historically. That's the nature of the beast. But I think again we're not competing with just one direct competitor. We're competing with traditional merchandise retailers and supermarkets. And on an overall basis, we haven't seen any dramatic change. Scott Mushkin : So you see the competitive climate is stable, not worsening not getting better? Richard Galanti : I think that's fair. Scott Mushkin : All right. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Rupesh, you are now live. Erica Eiler : Good afternoon. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our question. So, I was actually hoping to dive a little bit deeper into your online grocery efforts. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about how the Instacart and dry grocery ramps are going so far and what you're seeing with these offerings? And then any metrics you can provide such as type of basket you're seeing into how you're viewing the incrementality of the purchase, et cetera, would be helpful. Richard Galanti : Yes. Look today -- first of all the 2-day drive which we do with UPS primarily is now the entire Continental United States. Much of it arrives in one day, but we guarantee two-day. And it's expanding and we're obviously getting small number of sign-ups where that member is signing up just to receive online because they're too far away from driving. On Instacart they to ask you I'm sure you know have dramatically increased and their geographic footprint over the last two or three years. I think the thing that's most notable is that the value proposition to someone buying either directly from Instacart going into their site or go into our same-day grocery site -- one-day -- one day, sorry one-day grocery site which is the Instacart engine for fresh, we dramatically improve the value proposition over the last two years. And I think that's reflective of the fact that they've grown and have their own structure in place. And if we believe we can do that anchor tag customer anchor-type tenant in terms of driving value. And so we have sequentially I think now four times brought down pricing over the last two years of what the ultimate markup on goods is above what you can walk into a customer --. And so we're doing more business. It's growing at big numbers high double-digit numbers, but it's on a small base. Erica Eiler : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura. Simeon, your line is now live. Conference Call Participant : Hey guys, this is Steve [ph] on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our questions. So, apparel has obviously been a huge call out for you guys, but it looks like the soft line comps have been trending a little bit lower over the last couple of months kind of towards the mid-single-digit range. Can you just give us some color on what you're seeing within the category, any notable call out there? Richard Galanti : Hold on. Within soft lines and jewelry, that's been a little soft. Household furniture although some of that had to do with -- I don't know it's been a little soft. Conference Call Participant : All right. If I can sneak a little more in. On the MSI growth, did you guys call out what exactly was the fee high contribution for the quarter? Richard Galanti : $10 million. Conference Call Participant : $10 million. All right, great. Thanks guys. Richard Galanti : Thank you very much. Have a great afternoon everyone. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes Costco's third quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for joining.

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to your respective host, Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. Sir, you may begin. Richard Galanti : Thank you and good afternoon to everyone. I'll start by saying that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended 2019, the 16 and 52 weeks ended September 1st. Reported net income for the quarter was $1.097 billion or $2.47 a share that compared to $1.043 billion a year ago or $2.36 per share. This year's fourth quarter was negatively impacted by $123 million pretax reserve to SG&A or $96 million after-tax or $0.22 per share related to a product tax assessment. In terms of this $123 million pretax reserve or charge to SG&A, last week we received an assessment related to certain product taxes. They covered 7.5 year period from January 2009 through July 2016. While we will be filing a protest to this, a reserve for this assessment was recorded in the fourth quarter in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Excluding this reserve, Q4 2019 net income would have been $1.19 billion or $2.69 a share, a 14% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Net sales for the quarter came in at $46.45 billion, a 7% increase over the $43.41 billion last year, and for the entire fiscal year net sales in fiscal 2019 came in at $149.35 billion, a 7.9% increase over last year's $138.43 billion. In terms of comp sales as reported in the release, for the 16-week fourth quarter, reported U.S. was 6.2%. Excluding gas deflation, FX, and revenue recognition, it was 5.2%. Canada reported 2.6%; ex-deflation, FX and rev rec, 4.7%. Other International reported 1.9%; ex those items, 5.0%. So, total company both for the 16 weeks with and without those items was a 5.1%. E-commerce was a 19.8% reported comp and a 21.9% ex-FX and rev rec. In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, fourth quarter traffic or shopping frequency increased 3.7% worldwide and 3.6% in the U.S. Weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by about 60 basis points, gas price deflation was a negative 50 basis points, and rev rec benefited comp sales in the quarter by plus 110. So those three things together essentially zeroed out. Our average transaction or ticket during the fiscal quarter was up 1.4%, both with and without the impacts of gas, FX, and rev rec. Next on the income statement, our membership fee income reported in the fourth quarter was $1.050 billion, up $53 million or 5.3% over last year's fourth quarter. Ex the impact of FX, the $53 million increase would have been $58 million or up 5.8%. During the fourth quarter, the 23-month cycle to recognize the incremental P&L benefit of the fee increases that began in June 2017 was completed, and the impact in the Q4 results was almost zero or less than $1 million benefit to the quarter. In terms of renewal rates, at Q4 end, our U.S. and Canada membership renewal rate came in at 90.9%, up 0.2% from 90.7% as of the end of the last quarter. And worldwide, the renewal rate was 88.4%, up from 88.3% a quarter ago. Both of these figures at all-time highs. In terms of number of members at Q4 and fiscal year-end, we had 53.9 million member households, that's up from a quarter ago of 53.1 million, and total cardholders at the end of the year, 98.5 million, up from 97.2 million at the end of Q3. During the quarter, we had 10 net new openings, eight in the U.S., one in the U.K. and our first warehouse opening in China in Shanghai. At fourth quarter end, paid Executive memberships totaled 20.8 million, which was an increase during the quarter of 362,000 or 23,000 a week. In terms of going down the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was higher year-over-year by a reported 14 basis points, and ex gas deflation and rev rec, up by 20 basis points. As usual, I'll ask you to jot down a few items for explanation purposes. In the fourth quarter, you have two columns, both reported and then without gas, deflation, and rev rec. The line items would be -- the first line item would be merchandise, core merchandise. On a reported basis, the year-over-year was down 8 basis points. Ex gas and rev rec, it was down 3 basis points. Ancillary businesses, up 29 basis points and ex those items, up 31 basis points year-over-year. 2% reward, minus 3 basis points and minus 4 basis points; other, minus 4 basis points and minus 4 basis points. If you add those up, you get the plus 14 basis points as reported, and again, ex gas and rev rec, up 20. Now, in terms of the core merchandise component of the gross margin, it was lower by 8 basis points or might really lower by 3 basis points ex gas and rev rec. Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to our own sales or what we call core-on-core, margins year-over-year were higher by 4 basis points. Subcategories within that, the year-over-year and the fourth quarter showed increases in fresh and softlines, partially offset by a little down year-over-year in hardlines with food and sundries being relatively flat year-over-year. Ancillary and other business as mentioned was higher by 29 basis points and 31 basis points higher ex gas and rev rec. Most of that was attributable to strong gasoline margins. Other was minus 4 basis points in both columns. Moving to SG&A, I'll ask you to jot down the following. Again, two columns, reported and ex deflation -- gas deflation and rev rec. Operations, plus 3 basis points and minus 2 basis points, so minus 2 basis points meaning higher by 2 basis points; central, minus 5 basis points and minus 5 basis points or higher by 5 basis points; stock compensation, plus 2 basis points and plus 2 basis points, so lower by 2 basis points year-over-year; and then other, minus 27 basis points and minus 27 basis points. And with that, you would get to a reported SG&A percentage year-over-year being higher or worse by 27 basis points coming in at 10.09%; sales, up from 9.82% of sales a year ago. Again, excluding the one-time items discussed earlier, the SG&A would have been flat year-over-year on a reported basis and ex gas and rev rec, higher by 5 basis points. Now, in terms of the components here, the core operations component excluding the impacts of gas and rev rec again was 2 basis points higher. This figure included the impact of the two wage increases that were taken in June 2018 and March 2019, which essentially hit the year-over-year comparison by an estimated 5 basis points to 6 basis points in the quarter. We estimate that once the first one anniversaries now during the quarter, we estimate that the impact in Q1 and Q2 to that one anniversary will be about a 3 basis point to 4 basis point hit. Central was higher year-over-year by 5 basis points, both with and without gas and rev rec. IT was the biggest driver of that increase. In terms of stock comp, again, that was helped -- that helped SG&A by 2 basis points. And again, lastly as discussed earlier, the hit -- the $123 million hit to SG&A accounts for the 27 basis points. Next on the income statement, preopening expense. Preopening expense for the fourth quarter came in at $41 million, $10 million higher than the $31 million in the fourth quarter of last year. This year in the fourth quarter, we opened 12 -- we had 12 total openings, 10 net plus two relos. Our total preopening was up year-over-year primarily due to the preopening costs related to our chicken plant in Nebraska. It's now open for business and we'll have an estimated 45-week ramp up to fill production from the September 10th go-live date. All told, reported operating income in Q4 increased 1%, coming in at $1.463 billion this year compared to $1.446 billion last year. And again, excluding the one-time items discussed earlier, operating income was up 9.7%. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $3 million lower or better year-over-year coming in at $45 million, down from $48 million a year earlier and interest income and other for the quarter was higher or better by $23 million year-over-year. Actual interest income was better by $15 million with a combination of both higher invested cash balances and higher interest rates with the balance of $8 million positive variance, primarily favorable FX-related items year-over-year. So, overall, pretax income again reported, including the one-time item, was up 3%, coming in at $1.492 billion this year and from $1.449 billion last year and again excluding the one-time SG&A charge discussed earlier, operating income would've been up about 11.5%. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the fourth quarter came in at 25.7% compared to 27.4% in the fourth quarter a year ago. This quarter tax rate benefited from a few favorable discrete tax adjustments. A few other items of note. Again, in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, we opened 12 total locations net of relos at 10 net new locations. For the whole year, we opened 25 total locations, including five relocations, so a net increase 20. About three quarters of those were in the U.S. and a quarter of them international. At Q4 end, our square footage stood at 114 million square feet. Regarding CapEx, our fiscal 2019 total spend was right at $3.0 billion. And we estimate the CapEx for the upcoming year will be that or slightly above that but not that different from the past fiscal year. In terms of stock buybacks in the fourth quarter, we repurchased 52 million shares, 194,000 shares at an average price per share of $268.08. That brought the total year to 247 million shares -- $247 million on 1.097 million shares at an average price of $225.16. Moving on to a couple other items of note. E-commerce, again as I mentioned for the quarter, the ex-gas and rev rec was up 21.9%. We saw particularly strong growth during the quarter, what we call majors, electronics and appliances, and the like. Total online grocery continues to grow at a very healthy clip, recognizing it's still pretty small and that both includes the two day as well as the one-day fresh relative to Instacart. E-com for the first time this past quarter carried some new items like KitchenAid appliances, weber grills and several high-quality beauty brands for the first time. In addition, we rolled out a few examples of what we -- if you shop to the warehouse, what we call merchandise roadshows, kind of a treasure hunt for the warehouses. Some of those things are now being put online. We sold another large diamond ring during the quarter for $220,000. And we have upcoming e-com sites planned for two new countries, Japan and Australia -- excuse me, Japan and Australia later this fiscal year, sometime mid-fiscal year. In terms of the Costco app, we started to add a few things to with, including the new -- if you use as your digital membership card. That was added in July. We now have over 2.5 million activations during the quarter. Currently, the app allows in addition to digital membership to register as well. You view current gas prices; Executive members can view their growth of the annual 2% Executive Member Reward. We have a few things related to the pharmacy in terms of refilling and managing pharmacy prescriptions as well as be able to renew and upgrade and the beginnings of some new shopping lists, so it's for promotional offerings. And I will tell you, additional enhancements are in the works and we'll continue to roll those out and more guidance with Costco both in the warehouse and online. I mentioned earlier that during the quarter, we opened our first unit in China in the City of Minhang, part of Shanghai. That was on August 27th, it\u2019s a great interest. Due to the overwhelming crowds, it was actually closed about four hours into the opening day. Subsequent backgrounds have been well managed and sales have remained very strong over the past month. We've had record sign-ups there. I think it's been helped by first one that we've opened there as well as the social media presence. We have over -- we currently have over 20,000 members signed up. Just to put that in perspective, worldwide, the average Costco, ones that have been open for months and months that have been open for 35 years, all 12 have approximately 68,000 member households per location. Our next opening is planned for early 2021 and also in Shanghai in the area of Pudong. In terms of tariffs, next item, a quick update. It continues to be a lot of moving parts and changes and a few increases along the way. A few comments. As you're probably aware, the first three lists, which total about $250 billion of imports from China, includes things from water pictures and air fryers to bicycles to steel shelving to furniture and luggage shredders to things like that. That's current -- those are currently being tariffed at 25%. With the current plan, we understand approximately go to 30% effective October 15th, but we'll just have to wait and see. List 4a, which is about $110 billion, includes things like kitchenware, equipmentware and domestics, includes TVs, although I don't think we source from there from that. That started at 15% tariff on September 1st and we'll see where that goes. And then List 4b, which is an additional $155 billion worth of goods including electronics, laptops, tablets, toys, small appliances, and some of the apparel and footwear as well. That's currently planned to go to 15% tariff effective December 15th. Again, we'll wait and see. Since the beginning of these tariffs over a year ago, we continue to be active in managing and we're possibly mitigating the impact where we can. We accelerate shipments before tariffs is being put into effect or is being planned for an increase to tariffs percentage levels. We are working with suppliers daily. We've gone to pretty much every supplier on every item to see what we can do to both reduce cost and figure out how to do that. In some cases, we've reduced our commitments on certain items. And again, just on the impact of what we expect, we look at alternative country sourcing where possible and feasible and although again, there's a limited amount of that ability to do that. And we've taken advantage of lower pricing on certain -- on a few U.S. items that have not been impacted the other way. The exchange rate by the way between our two countries has helped a little bit. So, all those things. As you might expect, it's all over the Board, every item and every vendor is little different. In some cases, we're able to hold off on some and some, we're able to -- we need to push it forward and push that on and we will continue to pursue that. Overall, we think we're in a good position relative to retail overall and given our size and scale and our ability and relationships with our vendors. The last thing on tariffs, just another area of potential tariffs. It relates to yesterday's WTO announcement that the U.S. can legally impose tariffs of up to $7.5 billion in EU-produced goods annually. Later yesterday, the U.S. TR released a list of products it plans to target, with duties planning to take effect October 18th. Some of the products included on the list include 25% duties on certain whiskeys and apparel items for the U.K., various cheeses and olive oils from certain European countries and certain pork products, butter and yogurt from various European countries to name a few. So, that's pretty much it in terms of what we have to say. Lastly, in terms of upcoming releases, we will really -- we will announce our September sales results for the five weeks ending this coming Sunday, October 6th, on Wednesday, October 9th after the market close -- closes. With that, I'll open it up to questions and answers and turn it back to the operator. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have your first question coming from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is now live. Michael Lasser : Good afternoon and thanks a lot for taking my question. So, you\u2019ve recently run a few promotions to drive membership growth. You've done this in the past periodically. Should we interpret this as any different than that particularly given that you now anniversary all of the benefits from the price increase, I guess, you can say, well, you want to increase membership growth and so that's what's driving that decision. How should we think about that? Richard Galanti : No, I think that as it relates to the one, I think we've got currently underway, it's very similar to the three or four we've done over the last three years or four years I think. And no real -- we try to put some time between them. We don't want to get people waiting for a promotional item, but they do work and they help and any of the timing is just that, nothing beyond that. I don't anticipate doing another one for a while as we have in the past. Michael Lasser : Okay, that's very helpful. And then on your growth in China, did it surpass your expectations? And does that influence how many and how quickly you can expand in that country? Richard Galanti : Well, clearly, it surpassed all of our very high expectations. That being said, we're pretty methodical when we go into a new country, wherever it is, and we opened one or two units to start with over the first year or two and go from there. A lot of it has to do with the fact that building the people structure within a country, while we have help from neighboring countries and other areas to start the process, you really want to build your supervisor, your functional managers in the country. So, if you'd asked us before, we even opened the first one and felt positive it will be good, but who knows how and when we do -- how well we will do. [indiscernible] We've had five years hence. The answer will probably be the same as it is today. We'll open a couple in the first year or two and then open a couple more perhaps and see where we go from there, and we're certainly pleased and excited about what we've seen, but maybe it gets a little bigger, but certainly nothing that they -- we're going to be pretty methodical about it as we have in other countries. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much and good luck. Operator : Thank you. We have your next question coming from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Simeon Gutman : Hi Richard. So, on gross margin, it looked pretty solid. I want to make sure I heard properly, the core-on-core was up 4, which I'd say looks pretty normal for you, up a little, down a little, which means that the reported, it sounds like ancillary; the gas was a big piece of that. Can I ask you if the dynamics there, I think, over the past couple of years have improved in general? Are they still getting better or this was just pure market dynamics on the gas side? Richard Galanti : I think the last few years, not only for us but other big gas retailers, the supermarkets and the Walmart's, generally, the new normal over the last couple of years has been better. And particularly for us, I think as prices historically have come down and some retailers bring them down a little and some a little more, they still give us the ability to, in our view, to have improved margins and operations and probably showing a greater savings relative to what we had a few years ago. That being said, the quarter was good. There are a couple of quarters, a few quarters back year-over-year that was also good. It does fluctuate, but I'd say the new normal overall is on average better than it had been. Simeon Gutman : And the core-on-core was pretty normal for you as well? Richard Galanti : The core-on-core, well, yes, I don't think there was any big surprises there. We always tell you that when it's up a little year-over-year, maybe it'll come down a little. When it's down a little, maybe it will be up a little bit. As it relates to the underlying factors of competition, we feel that we haven't seen any giant changes in the competitive landscape out there. There's still a lot of competition and there's a lot of headlines out there, but at the end of the day, we're still pretty darn competitive ourselves. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And my follow-up is on the EBIT dollar growth. It looked like it came in high single-digit like 9%-ish this year. And if you take the average over the last several years, it's coming around high single-digit that range. As you look out to your next fiscal year, is there anything one way or the other that should impact that? I think the consensus is modeling a lower rate. I know you don't comment on that, but it's been several years with a little bit outsized growth, and so just curious if there's any big spending items, margin issues that we should think about as we model the next year. Richard Galanti : There's lots of everything, Simeon. We really don't talk about the future. I mean we certainly feel good about what we're doing merchandising-wise where all retailers are impacted by tariffs right now. That's having a little bit of an impact. But beyond that, we feel good about what we got going on in terms of opening up another 20-ish units next year and driving membership. We're certainly pleased with the seeing our renewal rates continue to go in the higher direction and getting new members. So, overall, we feel good, but we'll see. Simeon Gutman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is now live. John Heinbockel : Hew Richard, two questions on gas. One, I don't think you -- or maybe wrong, you guys think about an interaction between gas margin and core-on-core, right? Meaning if you're getting more margin at the pump in any given quarter, you can't put that back a little bit into core-on-core. Do you think about it that way? And then on gas, gallon growth, where is that now versus where it's been over the last year or two? Richard Galanti : Well, look. We don't -- in terms of the margin if we're doing stronger and wanting to do, can we be a little more competitive elsewhere? Well, not completely. Human nature dictates that sure, when things are going well in one area, you see what else you can do in another area. But I would say there, we don't manage it that way necessarily. As it relates to gallons, I think our gallons are up in the high singles. You have a theory, yes. So, we continue to do in terms of gallon comps much stronger than whole U.S. industry of gallon of gasoline. John Heinbockel : And then secondly, what's your -- where do you stand now with the opening schedule for the year? Maybe by geography and cadence. Is it -- I guess, this past year was a little bit back-end loaded and I guess, it's the same in 2020? Richard Galanti : Yes, probably so. We generally try to get things open before the holidays, so when things are -- if you missed the holiday, whether it's February or April or May, who cares as much, but if you try to push it forward little bit as you approach back-to-school, Labor Day all the way through Christmas and New Year's. And so I think the last -- the year before was the same way. We opened a disproportionate number of locations in Q4. So, generally speaking, yes, I don't have a schedule in front of me exactly, but-- John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good evening. So, wanted to ask you a question about average ticket growth ex FX and gas. If you take a look in August, that showed slow down pretty sharply relative to the prior trend. So, want to pick that at that. Is that a comparison? Is that a change in mix or perhaps lapping against some of the center aisle of grocery, price increases that the vendors are starting to put through last year? Is it investment in price then? And so just want to get your thoughts on what's driving that and any thoughts on the outlook there? Richard Galanti : Well, I think the prior -- if I'm not -- if I'm correct, I think the last in Q3, it was like one-eight or one-nine and this quarter, it was a one-four. I don't have a good answer, a specific answer for you on that. It could be mix. It probably is mix, but I don't know off the top of my head. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And then on the tariffs, as you think about what's been passed through, how are your peers acting? Are you seeing more -- are your peers taking portfolio approach in terms of you're trying to keep price items at certain price points and then balancing out versus, say, less elastic items and how are you assessing the landscape on that side? Richard Galanti : Yes, I can say to start with that we don't see any major competitive issues. Certainly, it's -- I personally think it's easier to manage some subset of our 3,800 total items that we saw at given times on location versus retailers selling at 50,000 and 100,000 and 150,000 items and they're dealing with categories. Certainly, on bigger ticket items, it's harder. I mean it's hard. With smaller-ticket items, it might be easier to eat a little bit of it. One with something like furniture or Lawn & Garden and things like that, that's a little harder. But overall, we have -- we generally feel pretty good about it. And we're, by the way, the other thing is we're an item-driven business. I'm sure -- I don't have examples in front of me, but I'm sure there have been examples of items where if we weren't able to greatly mitigate or mitigate as best we can be some of that tariff, in some cases again, we will try to geographically move the item or source from another supplier. There are limits to what you can do on that. But overall, I think were able to decide not to sell something and put something else in its place. I think that makes a little easier for us relative to general merchandisers. But again, it's -- it impacts us all. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And then on the announcement last night, I mean, there is some items on there that standout, olive oil and cheese. Can you talk about particularly in the olive oil side; I imagine this might be the largest seller of olive oil in the United States. So, can you talk about where you're sourcing that? I think Spain's covered, but Italy is not? Richard Galanti : Yes, we source from several countries, including the ones that you just mentioned. There'll be some impact. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And then I guess the last question is that the money question here is another quarter down and we haven't had any announcement as to what you're going to do with all the cash in the balance sheet that continues to build. So, can you talk about what is your thought process is there? Has anything changed? Are you trying to keep dry powder for any particular reason? Thanks very much. Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, I don't think there's any dry powder -- M&A-related dry powder. We haven't or currently plan to do anything. We do have a total of $1.7 billion coming due in December and February, $1.2 billion and then $500 million I believe. And so we'll write -- we'll pay that down. We're always asked about questions about the special dividend, and our comments have been is that we've done three of them. They seem to have worked well or viewed positively. So, it's still in the -- it's still in our back pocket. But they are special, and so we'll have to wait and see what we decide to do in the future. But there's nothing specific that we have planned. Christopher Horvers : Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We have your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is now live. Karen Short : Hey, thanks very much. Just on operating profit growth. I mean it was -- so the 10%-ish growth, it was up $140 million excluding the product tax assessment. But can you just give a little color on how much stronger year-over-year gas margins might have impacted that growth rate? Because I was kind of backing into about $150 million in incremental dollars from better gas margins-- Richard Galanti : Well, we don't disclose specifics. But as I think I mentioned, I think it was Q2 year-over-year that we also had a good gas margin, certainly, that was a help to that. Karen Short : Okay. But is that estimate like somewhere in the range or is it way too high? Richard Galanti : We really don't disclose -- Karen, we really don't go into that specific of a detail. Karen Short : Okay. And then wondering if you could maybe give a little color in terms of elasticity and anything you can point to on elasticity response with categories where you did raise prices. Richard Galanti : Sure. I mean generally speaking, the bigger the ticket items where you also have a good portion of the tariffs impacts the price, raises the price. I mean there was -- these are anecdotal examples, but there was one category of those types of items that typically is up mid-single-digits year-over-year and instead was flat to down a couple of percent. And that is -- that included some pricing increases, so probably; I was down 10% in units. But that's a subset of a subset of a category, and so I don't want to suggest it was everything. But I mean given examples from our buyers where there have been items where we've essentially -- most of the tariffs is reflected in our price increase and we saw just as many users as we thought we were going to previous to that. There's been others where we've -- the price increase tariff-related, less than half of the tariff related to the price increase and even that, we saw some unit reductions results. So, it really has been over the board. But generally speaking, the bigger the item, when you pick an item that retails for $999 and have to get it up, we get it even about $1,240 -- by using a 25% example or beat 25% of the cost. But unless -- first that you try to do is get it to $1,199 and then go from there or $1,099. But it's really over the board. That net-net that was a slight negative impact. Karen Short : Okay. And then, I guess along those lines, can you just maybe give a little color on what inflation was at, I guess, both cost and at retail? And then if you can parse that out between consumables and non-consumables? Richard Galanti : It was very little. We've seen very little. You still see taking tariffs away for a second on electronics and things you'll see some deflation. Overall in consumables, it's been pretty much steady as she goes. One question I was asked earlier this week was about what's going on with the freight components, and freight has actually improved a little bit you over year. It's higher than it was a few years ago, but overall; it's all in the soup here. Karen Short : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We have your next question coming from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Your line is now live. Chuck Grom : Hey thanks. Good afternoon Richard. Just on the core-on-core between categories, a couple were up, hardlines was down. Food and sundries, I think, you said was relatively consistent year-over-year. Just can you dive into the hardline compression and also the change from last quarter on the food and sundries segment? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Yes. A part of its mix change. I mentioned earlier online but also in store, electronics and majors, those tend to be a little -- electronics tends to be a little lower-margin business, but good growth still. And that again, when I ex the $64,000 question of is it competition, we're not seeing a lot of big changes out there, whether there's a lot of headlines of what's going on particularly on the food side, but we haven't seen any big changes. Chuck Grom : Okay, fair enough. And then can you just remind us how you guys are thinking about the company's long-term club growth potential, particularly here in the U.S. and if you're seeing any signs of saturation in any of your key markets, both domestically and internationally? Richard Galanti : Well, by definition, like in the U.S. and Canada and the rate of growth will slow down. But I would have said that three years ago because of what we've done in the U.S. and Canada. So, we keep finding more opportunities. But over time, it will slow down. We're also, of course, adding the business centers. We have, I think, 18 in the U.S. and one in Canada with our second coming shortly in Canada and so that'll add a little bit to it. When asked recently, what is your guesstimate, we truly guesstimate over the next 10 years on the basis of like five 40-ish in the U.S., maybe other 12-plus a year. Right now, it's been 15 a year, so it will come down a little bit. In Canada, one-plus a year. We thought we were a saturated at 80 in Canada and now we have 101 or 102. So, that will keep increasing. Certainly, there will be more -- what I think I think we feel most comfortable thing is that five or three years from now, the penetration of the percentage of those openings will certainly abide then likely by then if nothing is certain the outside of the U.S. and Canada. Chuck Grom : Okay, great. And then just last question, online sales, I think, are about 5% of the total revenue. When you guys are analyzing shoppers that are using either CostcoGrocery, Instacart, I'm curious if the purchases have replaced the in-store trip. And I guess if you've analyzed how that could potentially impact your in-store traffic over the next two to five years? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Look, it's still early. It's the first full year, I guess. Generally speaking, you see more shops overall recognizing it's a little less when you're shopping online. And then that is still to a slight net positive than what we've seen before. But we have to be on the lookout is does it replace the shop? How many shops does it replace? But what we're seeing is you've got more -- somebody who's inflowing if you will and reducing their trips to the location a little bit. So, I call it neutral to slightly good right now, but that doesn't -- who knows what happens tomorrow? So far, I mean, we feel good about that, by the way. But we can't predict. I think by the way, I think part of it also is when we talked about -- what we talked about in the past is we use -- to communicate to our members aside from the traditional Costco connection and a lot of the e-mails, and the e-mails are not just for shopping online, e-mails are talking about hot things that are happening in the warehouse while supplies last in some cases. And we've seen good examples of that that can help drive frequency to the warehouse or create a trip. And that along with gasoline, not every person fills up with gas comes in. So, I think about half do, a little over half do. Even if one of them is incremental, that's a positive. We don't check to see what that is. We're not asking you to. But we know it's got to -- it can't hurt. It's got to help. So, we think that we're -- I think those are the types of things that will help drive us continue to drive traffic into the buildings, which we want to do. Chuck Grom : Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have your next question coming from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Scot Ciccarelli : Good afternoon guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Just a quick follow-up on Chuck's kind of store opening question. Do you have a plan for U.S. versus international store openings for the current fiscal year? Richard Galanti : Yes, I think U.S. is still going to be a little more than half. I don't have the sheet in front of me. Scot Ciccarelli : A little more half. Okay, that's good enough. Richard, when you guys bring popular branded products where there's a lot of price transparency, you mentioned Weber grills on the call in your website, how are you guys trying to target for pricing on those kinds of products when they can be found in lots of different spots? Can you guys price competitive, of course, but can you provide any color on kind of how you're thinking about kind of price caps when you've got obviously the Home Improvement guys out there, Amazon, Amazon Marketplace, et cetera? Richard Galanti : Yes. Look, we want to be the lowest priced and we're going to go as low as we can feel good about it. I found in some instances, we bundle so we create a value that includes perhaps accessories and other items or an extra whatever and -- but these are real value, I mean, real items that have a value to it. And that's to show on even greater settings. And we've done that in all kinds of things, whether it's computers or big appliances. And by the way, I think a lot of times; competitive pricing tends to be on some of the entry level and what you see advertised, if you will. And then consumers generally trade themselves up to the -- with all the extra accessories and what have you and that's where we continue to show good savings to. I mean we look at some of those big-ticket items and we -- they're pretty very strong savings to traditional. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have your next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Bobby Griffin : Yes, good afternoon Richard and everybody else. Thank you for taking my questions. First, I just want to go back to the grocery delivery and some of the initiatives that have been rolled out here in the U.S. Have those been rolled into some of your other international markets that you're operating e-commerce sites in? Richard Galanti : Yes, Canada now, we rolled it out in Canada with some help from others. We would like to do it in a few other countries, but we haven't said when and where. But in short order. Bobby Griffin : Okay. So some time -- is it safe to assume some time in FY 2020? Richard Galanti : FY 2020, yes. Starting with the two-day, which is easier, two-day dry. But in Canada, we're doing one-day fresh as well. We'll be doing one-day fresh, but we're not doing it yet. We're doing two-day dry up there already. Bobby Griffin : Okay. I appreciate that. And I guess lastly from me, I just want to touch on working capital continues to be impressive with payables, as you know, ellipsing over 102% of inventory now. How much more room do you think you have in that as we model out for one? And is there any one-time items there that are driving some of the performance that we're going to keep in mind? Richard Galanti : Well, with the seasonal issues, our Q1 is a month or right around Thanksgiving time. And that's generally when it's the highest payables as a percent of inventories. So, I think generally, the low point is Q2 with February where the sales are a little softer on a seasonal basis. Other than that, if anything, as we build out e-com and have more inventory in there and want to make sure we're trying to grow it, that actually probably impacted a little negatively that was turning to the fact that it's currently a very strong number. We also have some programs where ideally, sometimes, you have been -- there's usually smaller vendors that even though we have negotiated extended terms in some cases, particularly in seasonal items or stuff that's coming a few months and, sometimes, if they need working capital, it's a good rate of return for us to pay early, if you will, what's called anticipation. These are not big numbers, but those impacted a little bit that will reduce itself. Overall, I'd probably look at what those percentages were at each of the quarter end for the last few years and assume it's not that different. That's the best guess. Bobby Griffin : Okay. I appreciate the detail. Best of luck this fiscal year. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have your next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Unidentified Analyst : Hey good evening. This is Jeff online for Chris. Just a quick question. You touched on this a little bit with the topic of tariffs. Just wanted to know your general temperature check on the consumer. It sounds like they are responding in some ways at big-ticket items like you said with price increases. But in general, what you're feeling on how consumers are acting just given both tariff politics and geopolitical concerns and stuff of that nature? Richard Galanti : I think all I remember is we speak in a sense that we're still seeing good growth, certainly, very good renewal rates, good results and openings. So, we feel pretty good about it. Now, if you ask me how does that relate to consumer, who the heck knows? I think we all turned off the television and stopped listening to everything every day. We'll all be better. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Richard Galanti : I think we're also -- everybody is a little desensitized to everything. Unidentified Analyst : Right. I understand. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We have your next question coming from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Your line is now live. Oliver Chen : Hi thanks. Congrats on the progress in diamonds as well. Regarding the digital execution, the mobile app development has been really progressive. What are your thoughts on the biggest needle movers there? And as you think across digital, whether that be adding new product or improving check out and search or your new D.C., how would you prioritize the bigger drivers for traffic and growth that large? Richard Galanti : I think, first of all, as it relates to the app, just getting more people on it. I mentioned there's about 2.5 million since we improved it, there's a lot of work to be done to add things to it. But that was like since July. I think we have over 10 million members on the app. One of the other things was just getting e-mail addresses from everybody. You guys have done this for a long time, we were a little later to the game then others in terms of collecting e-mail addresses years ago. And we had a big push in the last couple of years and we dramatically increased the number of members where we have good e-mail addresses. Now that sounds simple and why did we do that, I can only tell you we are and it's -- and that's helping. We're getting more people, we're getting more people to open the e-mail and click on things. And so I think we need to talk about in the past. We still have these different buckets of money starting with the improved -- the improvement from the credit card transition a couple of years ago to membership fee increase, tax reform, all these things have helped and, as you know, we take that into make it a better value for the member. And I think that's helped us whether it's buyers, Hot Buys, a while items. And I think that's giving us a little bit of a leg up over the last couple of years in terms of helping achieve the numbers that we have. So, I think more connections the members are going to help. Certainly, there's no slowdown in renewal rates. That's been good to us. Beyond that, it's what we see every four weeks in our budget meetings from the Myers, doing exciting stuff, constantly improving existing items. There are a number of examples, whether at KS side is we continue to improve the item and lower the price point well and improved item, and therefore, decrease the value dramatically. They're looking at exciting items, not just for us in the U.S. to ship to these other countries, but also to take some exciting items from other countries and bringing them to other parts of Costco. So, I think on when I think about from a merchandising standpoint, we're at the top of our game a lot of things. On the efficiencies side, we have a lot of expenses going on. We talked about e-commerce for a moment. There's cost associated with that as we do that. There's IT in general, with everything that we've got going on, whether it's e-commerce or fulfillment and depot infrastructure, the new poultry complex. So, there's lots of things that are in our numbers in terms of expenses as well and we've done pretty well. So, a little -- I think we keep doing the kinds of things that we're doing as it relates to global sourcing and in some cases, some vertical integration and -- but ultimately, driving more value. Oliver Chen : Thanks Richard. And you've done a good job managing the digital margins overall. Do you pursue the right kind of fulfillment options and supply chain and getting the smaller packages customers with speed? What are your thoughts on those investments and how they align with what customers are looking for with speed of delivery? Richard Galanti : Well, we're not going to be -- you're not going to be able to order something and drop it off an hour later anytime soon. For us, first order of improvement was actually I remember it wasn't that long ago were online, particularly on the big-ticket items, but physical items as well, as we expected delivery times of three to five weeks and now it's three to five days. And certain items with certain vendors are now on -- you can actually schedule delivery and installation. So, we're -- tires is a great example as well. It used to be -- with those online now, you can actually order them and have them and schedule your appointment at the warehouse where you're shopping at. These are all basic things but things that we haven't done for a long time. So, I think you'll see continued improvement in that. And none of it's easy, and it all costs more than you think. But those are our numbers. Oliver Chen : And finally that you've really had good momentum, including with diamonds at Costco and the big-ticket sales of diamonds. What's your strategy with that business? And how has it been going? Any things we should think about? Richard Galanti : Look, I mean it starts with great quality and great value. Those are the -- one of the things I think that has helped us on -- that's -- the jewelry area is a good example with the lockers that we're now rolling out to a number of locations. A lot of people on high-value small-sized items, they can't ship it to their place of work and they don't want to leave it at their front porch. And so we saw an uptick of some of those items and some other items like handbags and a little bit number of electronics. But as it relates to jewelry overall, I know we've got a lot of press because I mentioned a $400,000 diamond a couple of quarters ago. We're selling close to 200,000 karats of diamonds a year. That's a lot of karats. And -- so jewelry business is -- it's one of the things that hits you just past the electronics when you typically walk into a Costco and it's all about value and trust. Oliver Chen : Thank you. Best regards. Operator : Thank you. Your next question coming -- comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Robert Ohmes : Hey Richard. Thanks for taking my questions. One question I'm getting is just a lot on the chicken plant. Can you just sort of let us know how that is going so far versus expectations? And also was it about $10 million of the preopening expense this quarter? And how does it affect preopening going forward? And maybe related to chicken plants, are there any other types of vertical integration, things that you might be looking out to do further? Richard Galanti : Well, look, this is a big plant. I think it's the most state-of-the-art plant that I understand in the country. It's going to be very efficient, but it's going to take close to a year to get to full production. And the first several weeks have gone as planned in terms of the first chicken went through and more each day and -- but you're going to get to 2 million -- processing of 2 million birds a year -- I'm sorry, 2 million birds a week in about 40 more weeks. The preopening stopped effectively when we opened it on September 10th. So, there's a little bit in Q1 but not like that big amount. But it's a huge facility, and it's also air-chilled. About 95% of U.S. poultry plants are still water chilled. So, all the issues in terms of -- it's considered a very high-quality food item and it allows us to deliver that while doing a lot of things for the environment as well. So, there's a lot of good things. It didn't come without a cost. It was a big investment for us and a little bit more in a year, but we're excited about it. Other things, we had -- a year ago, we had a second meat plant. We've had one in Tracy, California for many years. We opened one in Morris, Illinois. We also, as you know, opened a bakery commissary in Canada that will also serve much of the United States in terms of things like cookie dough and croissants ready to bake off on premise. We're looking at a variety of greenhouse opportunities. There's a lot of technology and new things going on in the area of agriculture. Would be nice to greatly lower the price of not having to airship things to Hawaii as well as being closer to the market and being better for the environment. So, I think given our size and given some of the things that are going on, we're going to hopefully benefit from that. But that's -- other than that, there's nothing else, I don't think, we've got planned in a big way. But I would say beyond the couple of things I mentioned in the last year and a half and certainly this new chicken plant, a few things on the greenhouse side, but not the type of capital investment required that was done in the poultry complex. Robert Ohmes : Got it. That's great. Thanks Richard. Operator : Thank you. We have your next question coming from the line of Michael Montani from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Michael Montani : Hi Richard. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask for an update on Executive program rollout, if you can just remind us kind of which countries have it now and which ones might be slated to get it next? Richard Galanti : Well, we have it in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, and Japan. And we've just started -- we just rolled it out this month in Japan. Korea, we rolled out about a year, year and a half ago. A year ago. Michael Montani : Okay, great. One housekeeping one if I could is around gasoline. Can you give us a sense? I've been thinking that was around 10%, 11% of sales for the quarter. And also what was the ASP for gasoline this quarter? Richard Galanti : Hold on. I think it's on the [Indiscernible]. $2.94 versus $3.05 a year ago. Michael Montani : Okay. And the last thing that I had was on Citi Visa, can you give us an update just on how many members have that now and what you're seeing in terms of third-party spend, just how it's progressing? Richard Galanti : I don't have those numbers in front of us. I can tell you we continue to add new members. We continue to -- the average reward per existing credit card holder on the Citi Visa card continues to increase. The rewards are substantial, and it's really working well. It's probably better than we had originally had hoped and it's done well for us and hopefully our partners. Michael Montani : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have your next question coming from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is now live. Kelly Bania : Hi good evening. Thanks for fitting me in Richard. Just wanted to go back to the store potential question really in the U.S. I think it was a few years ago that you know that you were able to kind of go into some smaller communities than you maybe originally thought. And so just curious, as you think about the next couple of years, what kind of size and demographics of the communities are you looking at and planning for new clubs. And also, when you go back to the saturation question and think about how do you analyze when you think you are at saturation, what are some of the key metrics that you look at? Is it the pace of the ramp in terms of sales, the cannibalization of members? Or just any help on how you guys think about analyzing that? Richard Galanti : 30 years ago, I think the view was you needed about 0.5 million people to trade area plus certain number of businesses and all that kind of stuff. Today, that number could be as low as 200,000 sometimes. It depends. Some of the smaller or medium markets we've gone into in the last few years generally are markets where our competition -- our direct competitors were, in many cases, for 20 or 30 years and we had just never gone there. We've gotten probably a little more confident that when we go in it, there's room for both of us, and we've done relatively well. I think the other thing is, if you look back over the last few years and my guess is in the upcoming years, there'll be some infill opportunities. I've used the example on calls on the East side of Seattle, in the Bellevue side of Seattle where, historically, we had three locations, Issaquah, Kirkland and Woodinville. About two years ago, we opened in Redmond. And we only added -- let's say in those three locations, had about 190,000-ish members between them, households, so 60,000, 65,000 each. We only added about 10,000 new members in the next year, but you had a lot of loyal members that started shopping more frequently because we were closer to them. Part of that comes with you have high volume. And those -- that example, I think as -- before we opened that fourth location on this side of Seattle, we had I think over $800 million aggregate sales, 1 in the low threes and the other two in the mid to high twos. And when you get to that level, that gives a little more comfort that you can afford a little cannibalization. In that example, I think the first year, net of cannibalization, we did $120-plus million of business, $120 million, $130 million of business. So, it's pretty easy to estimate and guesstimate what you think you can do particularly when you have a loyal membership base. And then there are other markets like if you look at the Greater Los Angeles market, I'm talking greater geographic market, I think we probably have 60-ish -- roughly 60 units. The view is we can have another 15, but they're all very specific geographies, which are not quite impossible, but very difficult. And we'd be thrilled to get 1 of those 15 open every couple of years, but you don't know if that can happen. So, I think it's all over the board in terms of smaller trade areas, markets where our competition has been and we are just entering and then continue the expansion and infills. Kelly Bania : Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just another one on click and collect and how that's going and maybe what you're learning from a logistics and labor perspective as you do that for some of the big ticket items. And then any changes or thoughts with respect to broadening that to some other categories like grocery, which I realize are more maybe complicated and labor-intensive? Richard Galanti : Yes, I don't see us going too deep. I mean we're talking about tires and pharmacy and jewelry, handbags, computers, high-value small-sized items for the time being. Kelly Bania : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We have your next question coming from the line of Laura Champine from Loop Capital. Your line is now live. Laura Champine : Thanks for taking my question. It's just a quick one on inventory. Your inventory receipts looks like were -- grew a little less rapidly than they have in prior quarters and also relative to sales growth. So, just wanted to get a sense of why you might have cut your ordering and whether that has any -- whether that reflects on your thoughts on our current quarter sales trends? Richard Galanti : My guess is it's a little bit of an anomaly that I don't read a lot into it. It might be that we've really built up, as an example, increased year-over-year online, inventories related to our e-com and things like that. But that's happened -- maybe less of that happened in this quarter. We've kind of cycled that for a year, I'm guessing. Other than that, I don't -- there's nothing baked to read into that. Laura Champine : Understood. Thank you. Richard Galanti : Why don't we take two more questions? Operator : Thank you. Your next question coming from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Erica Eiler : Good afternoon. It's actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So, I just had one quick question just flipping back to international. So, when you look at a market like China, when do you typically see an inflection point and profitability in those clubs? Richard Galanti : Well, at the club level, it could be the first year or a few years down the road. You've got a big central expense you've geared up. Whether you have one location or 10, there's not a big change -- a huge change in the cost of a central -- with the buyers and operations people and accounting department and the like. I mean it'll grow some but not nearly from one to 10. And so it depends on the country. Usually, it can be year four or five. I think in Japan, which is now 20-ish years old, our original budget was to open five in five years and turned a quarter of profitability towards the end of year five. I think we hit profitability near the end of year four, and we opened six. So -- but that's probably a good guesstimate. It's probably going to be slower in a country like France where it took us 10 years to get one opened. And while we're just looking for additional sites, it still could be a couple of years out. So, you're not going to go from one to five in five years. But that's going to happen. We're going to have a mix of those. Erica Eiler : Okay, great. That's helpful. Operator : Thank you. We have your next question coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Your line is now live. Chuck Cerankosky : Good evening Richard. One housekeeping question. Can you talk about the tax reserve on the product? What drove that? Was it an excise tax kind of thing? Richard Galanti : It was essentially on tax that some authority thought we should have been collecting and we're, again, going to file a protest and see how much. But I can't really talk to a lot about it yet. But again, it relates to, I'd say, a seven and a half year period that ended in 2016 that we were just notified before the formal assessment. And again, under GAAP accounting, we've reserved for it. Chuck Cerankosky : Okay. And then looking at the tariff situation, could that maybe an impetus to put -- use private label sourcing on more products as a result to get the price down? And in general, what are you thinking about for new categories, new items for private label in the coming fiscal year? Richard Galanti : Yes, not really for tariffs. First of all, some of our private label items are sourced out of China as well, so it's going to impact everybody. And nothing changes quickly overnight. In terms of KS items, I think that you have seen of late and you'll continue to see a variety of items, I mean recent introductions or things like all kinds of specialty waters, essence waters, extra virgin olive oil that they have some impact on tariffs, chocolate chips. I'm just looking down the list here, several apparel items for men, women and children, more housewares. So, I think you're going to continue to see that grow and even -- and raise the quality further of existing items, that continuous improvement cycle. You're going to see that on some frozen food items, diapers. I'm just looking down my list here, soaps, coffee pods. We've taken the KS coffee pod, which I think, three or four years ago, we went -- it went to fair trade. Since then, we -- it's now organic and recyclable and we've lowered the price by over 10% to the customer while improving, if you will, the value and the quality. And it's driving more sales. So, we -- again, we -- there's lots of little things as regards to the types of items and what we're doing there. Chuck Cerankosky : All right. Thank you. Good luck for next year -- this year. Richard Galanti : Thank you. I think that's it. Well, thank you, everyone and the group here will be around if there's any additional questions. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you, everyone, for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Have a lovely day.",

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. Please go ahead, sir. Richard Galanti : Thank you Laurie and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the 12 weeks ended November 24. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $844 million or $1.90 per share compared to $767 million or $1.73 a share last year in the first quarter. This year's first quarter results included a $77 million or $0.17 per share income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Last year's first quarter results included a $59 million or $0.13 per share income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Net sales for the quarter came in at $36.24 billion, a 5.6% increase over the $34.31 billion sold during the first quarter of last year. Comparable sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in the U.S. on a reported basis was 4.7%, ex-gas deflation was 5.0%. Canada reported a 2.9%, ex-gas deflation and FX plus 5.1%. Other international reported 3.2%, ex-gas deflation and FX plus 4.5%. So total company was a 4.3% reported and ex gas deflation and FX of 5.0% E-commerce on a reported basis was a 5.5% and a 5.7% on a reported basis. Total and comparable company sales for the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately 0.5% due to Thanksgiving occurring a week later this year. E-commerce sales in the quarter were negatively impacted by an estimated 12 percentage points. So again the 5.5% and 5.7% were impacted to the negative by 12 percentage points. In terms of the Q1 comp sales metrics, first quarter traffic or shopping frequency increased 3.4% worldwide and 3.1% in the U.S. This again includes the impact of the Thanksgiving holiday shift. Weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 30 basis points and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 40 basis points. Our average transaction or ticket was up 0.9% during the quarter including the negative impacts of gas deflation, FX, and the holiday shift. Next on the income statement, membership fee income. Reported membership fee income came in at $804 million, up 6.1% or $46 million from last year's $758 million. Deflation, foreign of FX currencies would have impacted that by a $1 million to the negative. So, it would have been about $1 million higher, ex FX. In terms of renewal rates at Q1-end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates came in at 90.9% and worldwide rate was 88.4%, both of these figures remaining at the same renewal rate levels that were achieved 12 weeks ago at the fiscal year-end. In terms of number of members at Q1-end, in terms of member households and total cardholders, at Q4-end back in, I think on September 1, we had 53.9 million member households at Q1 and 12 weeks later was 54.7 million, and total cardholders increased from fiscal year end of 98.5 million to 99.9 million at Q1 end. During the quarter, we had three new openings, all in the U.S., a business center in Dallas, Texas; and two additional Costco warehouses in Connecticut and Minnesota. We also relocated one of our units in Canada. At Q1-end, paid executive memberships totaled 21.4 million, an increase of $579,000 or 48,000 per week since Q4-end. This included the recent launch of offering executive memberships to [indiscernible] the first time as of the beginning of the fiscal year. Even taking those out, the average weekly increase would have been ex the new [indiscernible], executive members would been 41,000 a week. Going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was higher year-over-year by 30 basis points coming in at 11.05% as compared to a year ago 10.75%, and again on a reported basis 30 ex-gas deflation would have been plus 26. Doing the little chart that we do each quarter, two columns reported ex-gas deflation. First line item would be core merchandise year-over-year in Q1 of 2020 compared to a year earlier quarter, minus 3 basis points on a reported basis and minus 6 basis points on an ex-gas deflation basis. Ancillary businesses plus 20 and plus 19. No change to the 2% reward, and other was plus 13 and plus 13. So total of plus 30 basis points on a reported basis and plus 26 ex-deflation. Now, the core merchandise component of gross margin, again lower by 3 year-over-year reported minus 6 ex-gas deflation. Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales, core on core, if you will. Margins year-over-year were higher by 4 basis points. Subcategories within the core margins year-over-year in Q1 showed increases in hardlines, softlines, and food and sundries and a decrease in fresh foods. Nearly all of that decrease in fresh foods was the result of the initial operating losses from our new poultry complex. That will be a small headwind throughout the year. Recall that we commenced operations at the Nebraska chicken plant on September 10 with roughly a 45-week plan to get to full production and processing capacity, and we are currently on track to do so. Ancillary and other business gross margin, higher by 20 reported and 19 ex-gas deflation. The highlights in the year-over-year being gas, optical, tire shop, and hearing aids. The other, the pus 13 compared to year ago, this relates to what we mentioned last year in the quarter to adjusting our estimate of breakage on rewards for the Citi Visa cobranded card program last year, and that was again in comparison of the hit last year versus zero this year. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SGA percentage in Q1-over-Q1 year-over-year was higher by 17 basis points coming in at 10.30%, up from 10.13% last year. Ex-gas deflation SG&A was higher or worse by 13 basis points. Again, the little matrix that we do, both reported and without gas deflation, operations minus 9 basis points, meaning higher by 9 basis points versus minus 5 basis points ex deflation. Central, minus 4 and minus 4. Stock compensation, minus 4 and minus 4. For a total, again, of minus 17 and minus 13. These figures include, in terms of the core being minus 5 on an ex-gas deflation basis, this figure includes the impact from the wage increases that we talked about in the last couple of quarters that occurred. This impact relates to wage increases that occurred in March 2019, which hit the year-over-year comparison by 3 basis points to 4 basis points in the quarter. As mentioned previously, we would expect a similar impact that will occur in Q2 before we anniversary that wage increase midway through Q3. Central was higher again by four basis points year-over-year. IT was the biggest driver of the increase as we continued not only to maintain and upgrade but expand our capabilities and activities and certainly we have a lot going on there. And stock comp again minus four basis points hit there. That hit usually is in Q1 year-over-year based on the fact that we grant RSUs in that quarter and how we do things for employees 25, 30 and 35 years out. On the income statement. Next one is the pre-opening expense. It's lower by $8 million. It came in at $14 million this year in the first quarter versus $22 million. This year in the quarter, we had four total openings, three plus the relocation. Last year, we had eight total openings, six plus two relocations. All told, operating income in Q1 increased by 11.8%, coming in at $1.61 billion this year compared to $949 million last year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $2 million higher year-over-year, $38 million this year in Q1 compared to $36 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher or better by $13 million. Interest income was actually higher by $11 million and others plus $2 million variance was primarily favorable FX year-over-year. Overall pre-tax income in the first quarter of 2020 was up 13%, coming in at $1.58 billion compared to last year's $935 million. In terms of income taxes, our reported tax rate in Q1 2020 was 19.1% compared to 16.9% in Q1 of last year. Both of these first quarter tax rates, this year and last year, benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation, as mentioned earlier. Last year's rate also benefited from an additional discrete item, which we mentioned in the quarter last year. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, we expect to open net new units of somewhere around 20, plus or minus, with a lot of it planned to open new openings, much of it back-loaded towards the end of the fiscal year. As of Q1-end, we had total warehouse square footage of 114 million square feet. Regarding capital expenditures. In Q1, our total spend was approximately $700 million and our estimate of CapEx for all of fiscal 2020 remains right around the $3 billion amount. In terms of e-commerce, our overall e-commerce sales on a reported basis in the quarter was a 5.5%, as I mentioned earlier and again ex-FX 5.7%. Again, those numbers, you could add roughly 12 percentage points to each of those to account for our estimate of the impact of the holiday shift. A few of the stronger departments, home furnishings, domestics, tires and pharmacy. Majors, electronics were not among those departments as we believe it was the one most impacted by the holiday shift. Total online grocery continues to grow at a faster rate than the core e-commerce comps, although again it's a still relatively small piece of the business. New online during the quarter expanded tickets offerings including airline gift cards, Lyft and Uber cards and Super Bowl packages. We also, during the quarter, launched as a test in a few locations same day prescription Rx delivery with Instacart and we launched in the quarter same-day alcohol delivery also through Instacart in California such that as of today, it's being offered in 12 states. And lastly, earlier this week, we launched our Japan e-commerce site with our Australia site planned to open in the first half of calendar 2020. In terms of tariffs, there continues to be a lot of moving parts and changes up to and including an hour ago. Currently, there are again 3.5 lists, if you will. Lists 1, 2, 3 and 4 A, totaling about $360 billion worth of imports. There were possibilities that there would be a 4B list would go into place December 15. Although the current news out today is that China and the U.S. are close to a deal and on finalizing a Phase 1 part of the trade deal. And so we will have to wait and see. In terms of the EU. Currently, again there's $7.5 billion of U.S. imports that are subject to a current 20% tariff, mostly food items like olive oil, cheese, wine, whiskey, butter cookies, et cetera. Again, last week, just last Monday, the White House announced that it proposed increase to 100% tariff on $24 billion in imports, which would include those in among other items. We will just have to wait and see where that is. I believe comments aren't even anticipated to be complete until early to mid-January. That's pretty much it on our part. Lastly, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five-weeks ending Sunday, January 5 on Wednesday, January 8 after market close. And with that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back to Laurie. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Please ask your question. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good evening. So, I just want to step back and get your thoughts in terms of how you plan the holiday season this year given that there are six fewer days. It seems like a lot of retailers are expecting a big surge at the end, bigger than normal into Christmas, given the shortened season. Is that something, I am not asking about December just how you planned it? Is it something you saw in 2013? Is it something you are planning for in 2019 and maybe any comment through what you have reported so far? Richard Galanti : Well, I think we planned it and with some historical knowledge of what's happened in the past when you have got the shortest period of time between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And we plan, assuming that we are going to continue to have the types of levels of comps that we have in general, recognizing sometimes there's a switch between months as example being the switching -- Thanksgiving being in November versus -- Q1 rather versus Q2 for us in our example. But so yes, we do expect to ramp up on a per day basis. We will have to wait and see where it goes. But we went into the planning, I think, with the confidence that we have had, good shopping frequency increases and good renewal rates and pretty good comps. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And then on the pricing environment, it seems like Sam's has been taking some bigger hits to the gross margin line and it seems to be benefiting comps. So, are you seeing a step-up in terms of, in that core club channel? Are you seeing a step-up in price investment from your peers? Richard Galanti : In a word, no. Christopher Horvers : Got it. That's fair enough. And then my last question is, in 2Q you are going to lap, I think, a pretty big benefit in the ancillary line last year. I think it was up 33 basis points, big part of that being gas, so you are going to have gas prices. Do we have to give that all back? I mean gas prices look like they will be up year-over-year at this point but are still going to be down a bit sequentially and I know there is an interplay between those two dynamics. So, any thoughts you could give us around lapping that 33 basis points given those dynamics would be super helpful? Richard Galanti : Well, I think profitably for gas for us and as we have read from other retailers, big retailers that have gas stations as part of their retail concept, it's the new normal over the last few years. It has been a more profitable business. We, I think, benefit from the fact that we have seen our gallon increases on a comp basis in the very high single digits. So, we know we are taking market share. Despite increased profitability in that business, our savings in our view, when we can do price shops of competitors gas, it has never been as strong. So, we feel very good about where we are with that. Now sequentially, part of the increase, when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, last year's plus 30 or whatever, I don't have it in front of me, but whatever it was, had as much to do as what it was the year before. I think again when you read what others have said and what we have said in the last couple of quarters, it's been pretty good for all of us. So, it may be, you are not going to see that kind of delta on top of the big delta last year nor are you are going to see the big negative from that, negative from it coming back two years ago, but we will have to wait and see. We think what we have learned about gas profitability is, it could be very fleeting. Right now, it's been good as it was last quarter and as it was over the last couple of years in general, but you never know how to predict it from sometimes week to week. Christopher Horvers : Awesome, guys. Have a great holiday. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Lasser : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Richard, you touched on this briefly. But how have tariffs impacted Costco's profitability and if some of the tariffs are rolled back, how is Costco is going to handle this? Should we be modeling margin benefit over the next couple of quarters from this dynamic? Richard Galanti : Well, I think generally we have said on a qualitative basis, that overall I think companies of scale and certainly we are one of those and the fact that we feel that we have had a relatively good mitigation plan, if you will, easier on a 10% tariff than a 25%. I think one thing again on top of this, our scale in general, our ability to move in and out of items, if all of your items are 25% tariff because you are a furniture retailer or whatever retailer, that's different than a company that has a small percentage of our business in that area. Like others, we have moved a few things where we can and sourced it out of other countries. I think our total China imports into the U.S. is about just a few percentage points lower than a year ago. So, nobody can do a lot of that nor can we. But generally speaking, I don't think it's -- it's hard enough for us to budget it into our numbers. What we look at is, is the fact that in some cases where the price has gone up and we have passed on all or some of it, we haven't seen an impact to the unit sales. On others, we have and we never know until it happens, which ones are more elastic than others, if you will. But at the end of the day, we think that we have done as good as anybody in terms of being able to mitigate the impact. And so again, I think the fact that our margins, our core on core margins, generally speaking, even in the departments like hardlines and softlines, have been slightly up year-over-year. And certainly, we haven't done that without first and foremost being the most competitive out there. That makes us feel that now, we don't want it to continue and we don't want List 4B to come on or anything else to go higher. But I think we have done okay by it. Michael Lasser : So in cases where you have taken price or reengineered a product to make it cheaper, how do you handle that? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, I don't think ever we have tried to reengineer a product. We are going to try to figure out how to get the price down a little bit with the help of our suppliers. Sometimes, our own money or whatever else we can or moving a few items to another country and sometimes eliminating an item and putting something else in its place here. So I remember I think one anecdotal story would be in late calendar 2008 when the economic downturn hit hard and what hit hard in our case was a as good as our values were on $1,000 and $1,500 patio furniture, we had a lot of markdowns to take care to get through that in January, February and March when that stuff hit the floors. I can remember vividly, come June, following that when we were still in a bad economic downturn and our head of merchandising and our CEO reminding everybody, it's a budget meeting, I don't want to see us bring down the quality and stuff to hit a price point. We have taken 20, 30 years to get our members comfortable with the types of values we can bring, particularly on bettering goods. And so might we buy a few less units of something? Yes. Might we augment a little bit with some offerings? Yes. But we try not to. Michael Lasser : That's helpful. And my follow-up question is, given the well-publicized website outage over the holiday weekend, should we read that as Costco needs to make a more meaningful investment in its technology infrastructure to keep up with the growing size of that business? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, we live it every day here and certainly and we are. It was unfortunate. Despite all the efforts to have plenty of processing capacity, if you will, there was something that incurred. When we look at the five days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, those five days on a year-over-year basis, I mean we still were up in the very high teens as a percentage on e-commerce, so consistent what we have showed you what we have currently been running. What it tells us, we could have done better than that. So we did leave something on the table there. And again, we were able to correct it. It took several hours that day, unfortunately. But rest assured, we are spending a lot of money on things like that. Michael Lasser : Understood. Have a great holiday. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Please ask your question. Chuck Grom : Hi. Good afternoon, Richard. First question on MFI. Now we are past the fee increase and FX is normalizing, I am just wondering if you see any material reason why the 6% growth you reported in the quarter wouldn't be a good proxy in the coming quarters? Richard Galanti : Well, who knows as certainly, one of the reasons why it's growing a little faster than the total sales line, a little of it's a couple of recent openings like the China opening. That's a little of it. I think more importantly, it's some of the things that we have done a much better job of getting new members to sign up as an executive remember. You saw in terms of the number of new member which is a combination of new membership signing up as executive member as well as conversions to these executive member, we are doing a better job of that as well. And of course that aside from improving membership fees, they are more loyal member that shop more frequently and renew more at a slightly higher rate. And so I think a lot of it is some of the things that we are doing, getting the growing number of members, I mean U.S. as a example here with the Citi Visa card, signing up for that and having auto-renewal as well as opting into auto-renewal on other Visa cards that somebody may choose to use at Costco. And so those are the things that help as well. I would like to think it's all related to just great value and that's more things that we offer the member, which is certainly part of it too. Chuck Grom : Okay. Understood. And just to switch over to the balance sheet a little bit. Inventory levels were a little bit heavier. I presume that's just the timing of Thanksgiving. Any way to normalize for that, maybe inventory per club or some other metric, just to get a sense for what sort of apples-to-apples would look like? Richard Galanti : Yes. Well, I think it's mostly the shift of holiday. Some of it is a buildup with e-commerce and those holidays as well with more in the system. We are doing more fulfillment on that side. Again, in the few days since then, it's come down as we have expected. So I don't think there is a whole lot to read into it. Chuck Grom : Okay. Great. And then just last one on the core on core up 4%. Maybe quantify for us the drag that you are going to continue to see and then what you saw here in the current quarter from the chicken plant, just to get a sense for how much that was to the quarter? Richard Galanti : Well, the thing about, if we open the chicken plant, the first chicken, if you will, went through on September 10. Hopefully 45 weeks later, there will be roughly 2.2 million chickens a week going through there. The first three months, if you will, which is Q1 here, September, October and part of most of November, you were at the lowest end of that. I don't want to straight line it completely, but it's close enough for this discussion, going from one chicken to 2.2 million chickens, if you will. There is a lot of operating cost in running the plant. And while we don't have both production lines running yet, there's just a lot of cost associated with that. It should be a diminishing drag in Q2 and then Q3 and then Q4 and then not be an issue. Chuck Grom : Makes sense. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we have Chris Mandeville from Jefferies. Please ask your question. Your line is now open. Chris Mandeville : Hi Richard. So just a quick question on Central SG&A, similar to Michael. I am just curious with respect to the IT investment, if we should be assuming that that pressure that was realized in the quarter actually progressively gets a little bit more prominent on a go-forward basis? I don't know if that's what you were trying to reference or allude to with respect to expanding your capabilities and activities? Or if we should be thinking about something similar on a go-forward basis? Richard Galanti : If I look over the last several years with that word we have stopped using completely called modernization and now it's some modernization but other things as well. We talked about in the last, I talked about in the last several quarters things like e-comm fulfillment spending a lot of money on that. A lot of that hits SG&A in terms of all that technology. The chicken plant, to some extent. We have also over the last couple of years done a reset of certain departments within IT based on wage competition in this part of the woods up here in the Northwest. So I mean there's a lot of things that go into it. And we have got a lot going on, whether it's e-comm, continued increases in infrastructure and vertical integration as well as our depot operations and modernization. So I don't know. I think that when we first started talking about modernization years ago and it was just that, as best we could we estimated originally over a few years it would be incremental 10 basis points to the company. And then quickly, we felt it could be 13 and ultimately it was 18 or 19. And then, a couple of years went on a quarter-over-quarter basis, some quarters it was six and some quarters, it was two or zero. So I think a couple of quarters ago, maybe three quarters ago, it was flat year-over-year to that impact. And I reminded people that don't read anything into that like it is an inflection point. We have a lot going on both related to modernization stuff as well as expanding as well as vertical integration. So my guess is, it will still be a negative year-over-year. There's a negative, when those negatives anniversary a year hence, will we have incremental negative net? I can't say. At some point, it's supposed to slow down. Chris Mandeville : Okay. And then just my follow-up would be with respect to the Instacart pilot and delivering Rx to your members. I guess just what exactly you are attempting to accomplish there? And is the structure of delivering pharmacy any different in terms of how you are approaching things from a grocery perspective? Richard Galanti : Yes. Well, no, look, it's convenience. Like anything in life out there, as you might expect, we are always asked when are you going to start to do order it online and pickup up in store, when are you going to do this, when you are going to have something else. And we kind of do things our own way. We look at all these things and this is one area that with the Instacart relationship where we have them already coming into our locations, let's give this a shot. We already have a good and growing mail-order business. We have 540-ish pharmacies around the country. But this is another opportunity. Our pharmacies are sometimes, somebody does, won't come out if they are not feeling well. And so it was an opportunity given and as density increases that should help. But you have already got these drivers delivering groceries to others, hopefully we can do this. And it is something to add to the competitive belt here. Chris Mandeville : Is there a notable impact to one's kind of Rx margin profile? I guess I am just curious about that the economics there? Richard Galanti : No. First of all, it's brand new. And it's just a few locations, going to roll out to a few more shortly. So we will see where it goes. Chris Mandeville : All right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question. Michael Kessler : Hi there. This is Michael Kessler, on for Simeon. So a question on the competitive environment. We have seen Sam's Club undergoing an unexpected round of investments recently. And I guess is there anything notable that you would feel the need to respond to as far as what they are doing? Or anything that changes on your end from some of their investments? Richard Galanti : Not really. I mean, look, our warehouse managers are in their locations every week. We hear about it and I hear about here every month by location or by region rather. And look, they are a good operator and a good competitor and we feel that we do a lot of things very well too. But there is nothing that I could point out. A year or so ago, we had pointed out that they have gotten a little more aggressive on fresh and some of these things ebb and flow. But at the end of the day, we feel very good about our competitive position. Michael Kessler : Got it. Okay. Great. And just one follow-up on China. The new store that you opened there, a little further away from the opening. Is there anything notable that you have learned over the last couple of months? And any changes to your plans as far as the rollout, which I know is a little more on the slower side? But any updates on that front? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, on the rollout side that we have one other one planned which was planned previously. That's probably about a year-and-a-half away. And we will continue to look to see what we want to do next. But not a lot of change there. Overall, the location has exceeded our expectations. We have brought in additional help from neighboring places to help but the sales continue to grow, the sign ups continue to do very well there. And we will see. So we have had a great reception. We feel good about from a merchandising standpoint and maintaining a supply chain. Very good. And we are getting, I think, good reviews over there. We have also identified a few items, one in particular is again just anecdotal. we have done a very good job over there with sea cucumbers which I still have never tried. But we have found is that particularly on the West Coast in several cities where you have got customers that value that as a great item. We have done very well with it. So just like anything in life, we have found items that makes sense in other parts of our operation throughout the world. It's fun to see out there and it's a high value, high price item at a great value at Costco. Michael Kessler : All right. Very interesting. Thank you. Operator : And we have a question from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citi. Your line is now open. Spencer Hanus : Hi. This is actually Spencer Hanus, on for Greg. You guys called out some sales headwinds related to the website issue. Do you think those sales have been lost? Or do you think they were just pushed out? Richard Galanti : I think some was pushed out, some went the warehouse and some was lost. In the scope of things, given our whole company, recognizing that e-commerce while growing faster than the rest of in-line, is still little over 5% of our company. So I don't want to be cavalier about it. We didn't excite the members that were delayed. But we feel we have got, so we extended the values that hit the 30-plus million emails that we sent out it in the early hours of Thursday. We extended those deals for an extra two days. And so we think we got some of it back. And again for that five day period, we did just fine. Frankly, we feel we did lose something that we could have done better than we had anticipated. Spencer Hanus : And then any comment on big ticket sales trends that you are seeing? And then how does the consumer feel heading into the holiday season this year? Richard Galanti : Yes. Big ticket items are strong, particularly electronics items. The fact that back in March or April this past year, we were able now to offer a full line of Apple products including the Macs and the watches and the like. And we have done very well with those. And online, we have done even better with those. And it's not just the Apple products. It's other big ticket high-end game computers and game consoles. Big screen TVs are huge, recognizing the price and value of those things for consumers keep coming down, which is great. Those are the things that have done very well for us. Spencer Hanus : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Please ask your question. Karen Short : Hi. Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions. I guess starting with the core on core. So you have obviously had pretty meaningful stability, I guess, on the core on core and you alluded to this a couple of quarters ago in terms of your scale and your buying power. But I am wondering if you could just frame a little bit on how we should think about core on core going forward because it does seem like we are kind of in a new norm of that being stable to up generally? Richard Galanti : Well, I think the fact is that, you are right, all the things that we do to drive value or to get better pricing or based on our volume or Kirkland Signature or whatever, just when you think it's safe to go out, we are going to use it to drive business, which we have done. We talked in the past about the monies from increasing the membership fee, the monies from the change in credit cards, the income tax reform, recognizing about a little over a third of the income tax reform went to improve hourly wages. But at the end of the day, those have given us additional monies to continue to drive value. And there are times when we see something, a particular department or something, where the margin might be very strong year-over-year. That's the first thing we look at. Even if we are giving a greater savings to the customer, is it too much? And so again, we are a for-profit business. We want to grow our topline first and that will help the other things. But we don't manage it completely to the basis point. That we would like to see it year-over-year even go up a little bit, but we have avenues to do that. Karen Short : Okay. And then on tariffs, just specifically to the tariffs for this Sunday if they were or not to go into effect. So can you just clarify, I mean the rest of the lists, like 1 through AA, I guess, obviously it's kind of already embedded. But is there anything to think about it in terms of 4B does not go into effect with respect to your positioning or the model or anything? Richard Galanti : Anyway, we don't know. I mean to the extent that we bought in advance certain merchandise to the extent we could, anticipating that that was going to go into place and so let's get it in before the tariff, we did. But it wouldn't change it, so as you are saying, it wouldn't change things immediately there. So if I mean, if anything, we have had a little extra inventory in advance of it. Karen Short : Okay. And then last few from me is just housekeeping on inflation and food and also in non-food and then thoughts on cash on the balance sheet as it continues to build? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Inflation is almost a non-issue. It's not either inflation or deflation, generally speaking. I mean, yes, we mentioned they are slightly deflationary year-over-year. Tariffs is slightly inflationary of course on those limited items. Yes, proteins are up a little. My understanding, that has to do partly with China and with swine flu as well as more demand for beef. Other than that, not a lot to talk about there. What was the other part of the question? Karen Short : It's cash on the balance sheet building? Richard Galanti : Yes. Well, we have two debt repayments coming due this week or next Monday. Next week and in mid-February totaling $1.7 billion from prior debt offerings. Beyond that, of course, cash at the end of Q1 generally is the highest level because you have started to sell more, but you haven't paid for everything yet relative to seasonal stuff or Thanksgiving and Christmas. So like our AP ratio was always the strongest on a quarterly basis. Beyond that, stay tuned. Karen Short : Okay. Great. Thanks. Have a great holiday. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : And we have a question from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. John Heinbockel : So, Richard, where do you stand now with self-checkout? I know you have been expanding that. How many clubs is that in? What are your learnings, right, in terms of consumer, member satisfaction, speed of checkout? And then what do you think the rate of expansion of that is going to be? Richard Galanti : Well, we currently have it in the U.S. and Canada in about 135 locations. It's going well. We have another 92 planned for early calendar 2020. So up above in the low 200s. And the senior operators continue to discuss it, additional rollouts with Craig, based on their performance. But overall, it's a positive. And so we will continue to do it, is my expectation. John Heinbockel : I mean, roughly speaking, when you think about savings, right. I don't know how material that is but is there an idea that you reinvest that? Can it be enough to reinvest back into the business in something like expanded BOPUS? Or I know you have been sort of reticent about BOPUS because of the cost. Is that something you can now begin to get your arms around? Or no? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, I think thoughts on either of those are mutually exclusive of one another. When I look at the millions or billions of front-end seconds we save in labor, we know full well that some of it is, you don't get it all back, but even if you take a conservative amount, there is money to be saved there. More importantly, the members like it. The only thing the member doesn't like is when there is a member in front of them that is going through with their full basket and is taking longer. But generally speaking, even the high volume, the few high volume units that I have actually gone to of late, like the ones in Seattle and I use them when I am in and now they are fast, they work well and fast. So there is savings. But I think as well it improves that customer experience. As it relates to buy online and pickup in store, we continue to look at what others do and continue to scratch our head and recognizing the average Costco, even compared to our two direct competitors, is two and almost three times the volume per location, almost two times and almost three times the volume per location. So we will have to wait and see. We are still not at a point. We look at it, but we are not at a point that we are planning to do anything with that. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Kate McShane : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. We wanted to ask about apparel. I know that this is a category where you have been a little bit more focused. I wondered if you could give some color about the performance of apparel during the quarter? What you see the opportunity to be? And how Costco can kind of position itself to capture some share going into the next year? Richard Galanti : Yes. I think it's part of the same story that we have talked about fortunately for the last few years. Apparel is a combination of both expanded Kirkland Signature as well as a few additional brands willing to sell us or expanding what they are selling us as well and great value. And it's a category in the several billions of dollars that continues to grow in roughly high single digits compared to retail apparel overall that's lot less than that. And I think I am always amazed at our monthly budget meetings when, in this case, buyers are bringing in and showing what's coming in for the new season whether it's outerwear, a few months ago outerwear for the fall or both men's, women's and children's stuff. Kate McShane : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Scot Ciccarelli : Good evening guys. Richard, I had a follow-up question on the Shanghai location. Can you just provide a context on the sign-up activity of that location relative to a more traditional facility? Richard Galanti : It's beyond good. I am sitting here with my colleagues on what I am allowed to say. The average Costco in the world has somewhere in the mid to high 60,000 of member households. We have had locations in other countries in Asia where we might be at a 100,000 to 120,000 after a few years, maybe even after one or two years. This one is more than twice that. So there's lot of press in a city that is populated with 25-plus million people. Scot Ciccarelli : Yes. I understand. So just given the fact that in the past you kind of talked about how long it takes locations to hit a breakeven point. I guess given the early sales and membership trajectory of that location, does that help change how you are kind of thinking about the breakeven point for that warehouse and hence the China opportunity? Or do you need more distribution scale to really get the profitability to where you want it? Richard Galanti : Well getting to seven or eight or 10 locations in a country where a bunch of stuff is American supplied and barge shipped, not air flown, you become more efficient as you go from one to three, maybe using some third-party consolidation or storage to do high value bulk items because you don't want to run out of water or toilet paper as you may, the no-brainer items. And over time, by the time we get up to eight or 10, we want to have a bigger cross-dock with enough land to continue to expand it over time. Cross-docks in the U.S. and Canada serve 40 to 60 locations each and 40 to 60 relatively high volume locations. So we have one in Australia that serves 11 locations. That will continue to be a little bit as an economic improvement to that country as it serves 15 and 20 locations. We have opened two in Japan, essentially south to north for all of 26 or 27 locations. We plan to have a lot more there over time. So certainly, in addition, we have a lot of extra help there. We are doing big volume and we brought over additional people from Taiwan that speaks the local language and then understand our concept and we have been fortunate to have that additional history and expertise when we have gone there, but also with Costco more. So I think you have got, what is the normal once it's doing whatever volume it's doing and it's efficiently run at the warehouse, maybe you don't have all the efficiencies from cross-dock. That will take several years. But the most efficiencies are what's in the building and how many people you need to help that process and become more efficient. So I mean it takes a couple of years to do that. And that's one of the reasons why we generally go slow in new countries because we want to get it right from a customer experience on an operational side. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Oliver Chen : Hi. Thank you. Richard, on your digital innovation roadmap, what are your thoughts about fulfillment from in-store and micro fulfillment centers? And also thinking about the robotic capabilities across inventory management or supply chain from in-store? Would love your thoughts. Richard Galanti : Well, just because of what we did currently a couple of years ago, we have our business centers that act as a focal point, as you know, for today. We have our depot operations. We have moved some of that fulfillment to annexes off of some of our depots as well where we put in to our biggest depot some automation fulfillment, which I have talked about over the last few quarters or last six months and we continue to roll some of that out. One of the things we have done is, is particularly things like how do we improve the time, particularly if items that might be presented in store but are only sold online like white goods, or what I will call big and bulky and those that require not only installation but sometimes take away the old one. While many third parties do that, we do a little of it. We have also figured out what are some of these items based on our volumes that can be staged efficiently and a dozen, I am making the number up, but a dozen geographic locations across Canada and United States to take the shipping times down dramatically. And we have done some of that stuff. And that's evolved over the last couple of years and we will do more. You have got a business of just white goods and that's certainly not the only big and bulky. There is furniture. There's patio stuff. There is exercise equipment. But just on white goods, we have gone from essentially sub $50 million a year four years ago, over $650 million and growing. And part of that is not just selling the stuff at great prices, it's getting it delivered to in fewer days. Oliver Chen : Okay. And Richard on vertical integration opportunities ahead, what are you thinking could or should be possible? And what's your framework for evaluating what makes sense for you in terms of owning more parts of the supply chain across different categories? Richard Galanti : Well, what started 25 years ago was a ground beef plant to save $0.04 to $0.06 a pound we thought a ground beef are now two major meat plants. One in Tracy, California where we started and one in Illinois, which is still growing into itself over the last year-and-a-half, two years since it opened. I think the one in California does well over four million pounds a week of just a handful of items that are ours. That gave us confidence to do the hot dog plant. We did almost partly by necessity a bakery commissary in Canada which we are finding can serve not only Canada but the U.S. on making more consistent and more efficiently crusted items like cookie dough and croissants. So we learn each time we do something. I think there has been some press out there about testing greenhouses for produce. We have got one up and running just in the last few months in California that I think some of the product is just starting to hit our shelves. But we think there is some great opportunities on the produce side for hothouses and greenhouses, if you will, particularly where transportation costs and time is a necessity on stuff that spoils quickly and easily. Right now, much of the produce that we ship to our Hawaii locations is air shipped. If you can do some more of that over there, that's a no-brainer. And given our volume and limited SKUs, we think that it's an efficient model to help. But that's not just us, others are trying that. Again, we think that the structure of our business allows us to take more advantage of that but it's new. I don't know if there's anything big. There is nothing as big as the chicken complex on the drawing boards. But I think we will continue to do things. But we are catching our breath a little bit right now. We have made some major investments for the second meat plant and the bakery commissary, just recently in the chicken complex and even more recently, the first of the few green hothouses. So we have got a lot going on. And the answer is, it works and so far and so good. Oliver Chen : And my last question. Richard, Kirkland is a nice competitive advantage. What are your thoughts on how that percentage of mix may increase and categories that may be suitable for that you are not in yet? And also you cited new services that you have added to your product assortment. How will services evolve as a percentage of total? Just would love the magnitude of what may happen there over time? Richard Galanti : Well, first, on the Kirkland Signature side, there aren't a lot of $0.5 billion and $1 billion items like water and various paper goods and things like that. And there are many, but not a lot of many new few hundred million dollar items. But yes there's lots of $20 million and $50 million items that can go to $50 million and $100 million and certainly I think on high-end packaged food items, on everything from not only organic but antibiotic-free. And I don't have all the adjectives in front of me, but there's lots of things that we can do that are high-end that our members want. And frankly has added benefits of seemingly gets in the millennials on some of those stuff. But I think we have expanded into some sporting goods. So there is lots of little things that will add to it. But if the number and I don't have it exactly in front of me, but ex-gas if the number is 24%, 25%, does it go to 30% over the next 10 or 15 years? May be. We think this is going to go up? Yes, likely a little bit because we found ourselves and our ability and our suppliers. Some of our private label suppliers are very good at what they do. But we also are still a branded retailer. We have very good savings, as you know, on branded items. On the service side, we don't talk about it a lot because they are small relative to the size of our company, but it's other things that make the membership sticky and are very profitable, whether it's the Costco auto program or our travel business which continues to grow. We now a year or so ago when we added the hotel only booking engine and more recently the airline reservation only, not just packaged items, package trips and everything. And so I think we will keep adding things. I can't tell you what yet, but we keep looking at things. Oliver Chen : Great. Happy holidays. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Greg Melich : Hi. Thanks Richard. I wanted to get an update on how the private label card, now that you have had a few years for it to properly season and scale, anything you could say on the penetration or how the sales are doing outside the club? And maybe link that to what the auto-renewal rates are now as part of the renewal rates? Richard Galanti : Yes. I don't know what the auto-renewal rates are. They are increasing. The big issue is, when we converted, prior to conversion when it was the other provider, there was both the cobranded card plus other branded cards of that provider, like Delta SkyMiles or something. And all those non-cobrand ones, all those auto-renewals went away, went to zero. So that had to be picked up over time and we saw that impact our overall renewal rate a little bit. The other thing is, as we continue to add new increasing number of members that have the cobrand card and the value keeps getting better and bigger. And so we think that will continue to be additive. That's helped. I think overall, we have also done a better job even when somebody walks in to sign up not only to upgrade but when they like to auto-renew. And so all those things help. Certainly the Citi Visa is probably one of the biggest movers of that because of just the sheer size of it and in fact that we are still adding new cardholders to that list. Greg Melich : Is Citi Visa doing multiples of sales outside of the club that it's doing in the club at this point? Richard Galanti : There's certainly more sales being done outside as there were over the 16 years of the previous relationship, that evolved over time. As we would have expected, this would be even greater than that outside versus inside spend and that's why we have revenue share which is good for us and them presumably. From the standpoint that the Visa card is offered at more smaller businesses which tend to have higher merchant fees in general anyway. So it's a whole new additional market potential of revenue share to those people using that card. If my card is top of wallet, there are certain places previously that I couldn't use it like the local dry cleaner and restaurant. Now I can. Greg Melich : Got it. And then you mentioned Japan and I think it was Australia coming for e-commerce if you look around the world. Any early learnings out of the launch in Japan? Richard Galanti : Other than it what, well it's been two days. So I am happy to report I know nothing. Greg Melich : That's good to hear. Have a great holiday, Richard. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Laurie, we will take two more questions. Operator : Your next question is from Scott Mushkin from R5 Capital. Your line is now open. Scott Mushkin : Hi Richard. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to talk a little bit about maybe growth that's being left, I mean, obviously you left on the table. Obviously, your performance is incredible. But the number of club opening has come down a little bit. You might say through omnichannel. So just as you take a step back, we look at our research, we look like you are kind of almost underserving certain markets in the U.S. How do you think about growth? Is it time to speed things up a little bit? Get back up to the 30 clubs? Maybe put a little bit more money behind omnichannel? Kind of what's the company's thought process here? Richard Galanti : I think I don't disagree with you. We want to open more than 20-ish this year. Part of that was, I think, some delays in how long it took overseas. We have got the pipeline filled a little bit better. And five years ago, well, I always said, our open plan is to do more than we were doing. Today, I would say the same thing. We do have, I think we will increase it a little bit, but I can't exactly say by how many and when. We are a very hands on company. And we have a lot of other things going on. And certainly there's a lot of emphasis on the e-commerce side, not only getting into few remaining countries but building it. Not because we are supposed to, but it's working. And we think that, in some cases, it's either sales that we would have lost anyway like big white goods you just don't sell those at store anymore. But we are getting people in the building still using this thing. So I think, don't expect some giant change from 20 to 30 in a couple of years. But our goal is to work harder to open a few more of those while we are doing all these other things as well. Scott Mushkin : All right. Thanks very much. Operator : And your question is from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is now open. Kelly Bania : Hi Richard. Thanks for fitting me in here. Just wanted to ask about executive penetration. You called out Japan and the impact there a little bit. But just I am curious how much in the U.S. you are seeing executive penetration move higher? I know we have asked this over the years but just and where you think that could kind of level out at some point? Richard Galanti : When I look by country, in the U.S. and Canada where it's been the longest and we have got the most units and the most services as part of the executive membership offering, it's in the mid-70s. In other countries where it's been, like Mexico, it's in the 50s and growing. But I think it starts off lower. I don't know if the marketing department has a plan for where it could go. It's more of what do we do to get people to convert and sign up originally. And so I think there is, if I was shooting from the hip totally, at some point there's going to be some members that don't want an executive membership, period. And even if it provides them some savings. And there's some people, they want it that sometimes it's not as much savings as they thought and they revert back. But at the end of the day, I would be thrilled to think that that could go to any one day, but I have no idea where and how long it will take to get there. We know that executive members are more loyal in terms of their renewal rates. They shop more frequently and they spend more each year. Kelly Bania : Got it. And maybe just one more on gross margin. Obviously mix impacts some other retailers more than it really impacts you. But I guess over the years, we have talked about things like private label, organics or international or even e-commerce in terms of mix shift. And just curious as you kind of look at that core on core up 4% which is clearly very stable, just what kind of mix shift is kind of underlying that? Richard Galanti : Well, I think it's more that mix shift. I mean certainly gas has the biggest impact. Gas is more than 10% of our business. It could be a gross margin line. First of all, -- and there is deflation. And so you could have the gross margin contribution, plus or minus, by a number of basis points. You have all the services while they are small work on higher gross margins than normal because they cover the pharmacy, the pharmacists and pharmacy tax. In optical, the optometrists, things like that. And those are all growing businesses, generally growing a little faster some of them than the company. Travel, as an example, would be. In travel, some of the things are gross sales and some of them are brokerage fees. So a very high margin. There is really very little cost of sales, it's commission. But getting back to the core merchandise, private label generally is a slight positive. Although, again the percentage of stuff that's private label versus branded while growing is growing at a slower rate than it has in the past. And then there's that magic word, competition. Our view is, as we look to how do we drive the top line, how can we be the most competitive. And we are fortunate that we have different buckets to do that with. So it's hard enough for us to know where the margins are going each month and each quarter other than we want it to be flat or up a little bit and we want to grow the topline which will solve a lot of things. Kelly Bania : Understood. Thank you. Richard Galanti : Okay. Well, thank you everyone. Thank you, Laurie. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. Thank you. Please go ahead. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Rochelle, and good morning to everyone -- good afternoon to everyone. I'll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the 12 weeks ended this past February 16, as well as February retail sales results for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, March 1. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $931 million or $2.10 per share. This compared to last year's second quarter of $889 million or $2.01 per share. Net sales for the quarter came in at $38.26 billion, a 10.5% increase over the $34.63 billion realized last year in the quarter. Comparable sales for the second quarter were as follows : in the U.S., for the 12 weeks on a reported basis 9.1%, excluding gas inflation and the impacts of FX 8.1%; Canada, on a reported basis, 8.9%, ex-gas and FX, 6.8%; other international, 7.9% reported and 7.1% ex-gas and FX. For the total company a reported 8.9% same-store sales increase and ex-gas and FX of 7.9%. Both of those numbers were positively impacted as well by approximately 0.5%, due to the Thanksgiving holidays occurring one week later this year than last year. On e-commerce, we reported a 28.4% comp for the 12 weeks and a 28% ex-FX. And, again, there is the bigger impact of this Thanksgiving holiday shift there, given the importance of that to e-commerce. E-commerce sales in the quarter were positively impacted by an estimated 11 percentage points and hence the 28% comp result. In terms of second quarter comp sales metrics, second quarter traffic or shopping frequency increased 5.9% worldwide and 6.1% in the U.S. Strengthening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, positively impacted sales by about 0.25% -- I'm sorry, by about 25 basis points. And gasoline price inflation positively impacted these numbers by about 80 basis points. Our average transaction size or ticket was up 2.9% during the quarter, which includes the positive impacts of gas inflation and FX. Later in the call I'll review our February sales results. Moving down the income statement for the second quarter, membership fee income came in at $816 million or 6.3% higher than the $768 million recorded in Q2 of last year for a $48 million increase. That percent increase is about the same as it was Q1 year-over-year. In Q1, we opened three -- we had three new openings. In Q2 we had no new openings. In terms of renewal rates, at Q2 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates were -- came in at 90.9% and worldwide renewal rate at 88.4%. These are the same levels of renewal that we've achieved at each of the last two fiscal quarters. In terms of number of members at second quarter end, in terms of member households and total cardholders, at the end of second quarter, we had 55.3 million member households, up about 600,000 from the 54.7 million 12 weeks earlier. And total cardholders totaled 100.9 million, up about 1 million from the 99.9 million we reported at the end of the first quarter. At Q2 end, paid executive memberships stood at 21.7 million members, an increase of 321,000 during the 12 weeks or about 27,000 per week increase since Q1 end. Going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the second quarter was lower year-over-year by 31 basis points coming in at 10.98% compared to 11.29% a year ago. That 31 basis point reduction lower number year-over-year excluding gas inflation, it would have been 22 basis points lower. If you'll please jump down to five -- four line items and two columns as we usually do. First column is reported for the second quarter and this actually would be without gas inflation. The core merchandise margin was down on a reported basis, 30 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. Ex-gas inflation was down 22. Ancillary businesses at minus five and a minus two basis points. 2% reward plus four and plus 2. And in total, as I mentioned, 31 basis points lower year-over-year on a reported basis and ex-gas inflation 22 basis points lower. The majority of the lower year-over-year core margin was driven by higher sales penetration of -- to significant lower-margin segments of our operations which are growing at a faster rate than the core, notably gasoline and e-commercial, as well as the start-up losses at our new poultry complex which I had mentioned in the first quarter as well. Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to only their own -- to their sales, core and core, if you will, margins year-over-year were lower on a reported basis by 15 basis points of which six basis points related to the losses from the new poultry complex. Within the core gross margin year-over-year in Q2, we showed a gross margin increase in softlines, food and sundries was about even year-over-year, and decreases in both hardlines and fresh foods. Hardlines was down in the quarter primarily due to holiday timing which shifted more promotional activity into Q2 this year. Fresh was negatively impacted by our -- a step-up in price investments versus last year in fresh and by the margin impact from the new poultry complex as I just mentioned. And we're now halfway through our first year of operations of the poultry facility which opened on September 10th and we would expect the gross margin headwinds to decline, but -- continue, but to decline a little bit as we get to full production capacity and improve operations. Ancillary and other businesses gross margins, on a reported basis, minus five basis points year-over-year and minus two ex-gas inflation in the quarter. Basically you had a few things that hurt you and a few things that helped you, but overall minus 2% ex-gas inflation. 2% reward was better by four on a reported basis and by two basis points ex-gas inflation. This relates primarily to a true-up of our breakage estimate of the executive member rewards. Moving to SG&A, our reported SG&A percentage year-over-year was lower or better by 22 basis points, coming in at 9.78% of sales, down from 10.0% a year earlier. Without gas inflation, SG&A was lower by 13 basis points. Again if you jot down the following few numbers, four line items and the two columns, core operations year-over-year in Q2 on a reported basis showed an improvement. It was lower, so I'll say a plus 17 basis points and ex-gas inflation plus 10; central plus one and plus zero; stock compensation was lower, or plus four and plus three on ex-gas inflation. And again the total on a reported basis, SG&A was lower by 22 basis points plus 22; and without gas inflation plus 13, so lowered by 13. The core operations component, again 17 reported, 10 excluding impact from gas. This figure includes the impact of the wage increases that occurred last March of 2019. This hit our year-over-year comparison by an estimated three to four basis points. We anniversaried that increase just this past week, so the impact in Q3 will be minimal. SG&A also benefited during Q2 year-over-year from the shift of sales penetration to lower SG&A -- if you will lower SG&A segments of our operations, which are growing at a faster rate than the core. Again gas and e-com. Central was lower -- within SG&A, central was lower on a reported basis by one basis point or flat year-over-year ex-gas inflation. We continue to invest and spend in IT to the tune of about five basis points higher year-over-year. That was offset by improvement in other expense items and of course helped by strong sales. And stock comp as I mentioned on an ex-gas inflation improvement of three basis points. This varies quarter-to-quarter. Looking at the last couple of years generally it's a small hit in Q1 and flat to a small benefit in the other quarters, nothing really unusual to report there. Next on the income statement is pre-opening expense. Pre-opening expense was lower; it came in at $7 million compared to $2 million in Q2 a year ago. As I mentioned earlier, this year we had no openings. Last year we had two openings both in the U.S., one net new opening and one relo. This year's Q2 pre-opening expense in this quarter relates primarily to a warehouse that will open during the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Coming up very soon, our opening in Perth Australia and also our first in the state of Mississippi and Ridgeland Mississippi that will be our 45th state of -- where we operate. Those will both open during the next couple of weeks. All told, reported operating income in the second quarter of 2020 increased by 5.2% coming in at $1.266 billion this year, compared to $1.203 billion a year ago. Below the operating income line, interest expense was the same year-over-year coming in both quarters at $34 million. And interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $1 million so almost flat year-over-year. Overall pre-tax income was up 5.1% coming in at $1.277 billion compared to last year's $1.215 billion. In terms of income taxes, our rate was just slightly higher year-over-year. In the second quarter it was -- it came in at 25.9% rate compared to 25.8% in Q2 last year. For all of fiscal 2020 based on our current estimates, which of course are subject to change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate to be approximately 26% to 26.5%. In terms of openings as I mentioned, we had no openings in Q2. We plan two net new openings in Q3. And I'll give you a range for Q4, which is our 16-week fiscal quarter of 11 to 13. Part of that, again most of the openings concentrated in our fourth fiscal quarter. And of course there's probably a few subject to slipping into early part of next year based on weather. As of Q2 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 114 million square feet. In terms of capital expenditures, during the quarter we spent approximately $545 million and our estimated CapEx for all of fiscal 2020 remains right around $3 billion. In terms of e-commerce, as again we reported a 28.4% comp sales increase and 28% without FX. Again a lot of that had to do -- a lot of that increase had to do with the Thanksgiving shift. We estimated again that about 11 percentage points of that related to Thanksgiving falling a week later this year and helping this number. Overall a few of the stronger departments, majors, special or kiosk items, seasonal and toys and housewares, these departments generally benefited from the holiday shift. In terms of total online grocery that continues to grow at a faster rate than the store comp both today and Instacart. The latter of which isn't included in our e-commerce numbers since they come into the warehouse to buy. Although the sales penetration is still very small, the sales are quite large in the high double-digit range year-over-year. During the second quarter we successfully launched both our Japan e-commerce site in December and our Australia e-commerce site this past month in February. And not to be outdone, we recently sold another high-value large carat diamond for a little over $600,000. If anyone's interested please give me your call. Turning to our February sales results, the four weeks ended this past Sunday, March 1 compared to the same period last year. As reported in our release, net sales for the month of February came in at $12.2 billion, a 13.8% increase from $10.72 billion a year ago. In terms of geography, U.S. reported comp to four weeks 12.4% ex-gas and FX 11.6%. Canada reported a 10.2% ex-gas and FX at 10.4%, other international a 12.5% ex-gas and FX of a 13.5%. So a total company at 12.1% reported and a 11.7% ex-gas and FX, e-comm for the 4-week period 22.6% for the reported and 22.7% ex-FX. Our February results benefited by last week's big uptick in sales, the fourth week of last month mostly we believe related to concerns around the coronavirus. This positively impacted amongst total and comparable sales numbers by approximately 3 percentage points. U.S. regions with a strong sales results in February were the Northwest Texas and the Midwest. Internationally in local currencies, we saw strong results in Taiwan, Japan, Spain and Mexico. For the month foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar hurt Feb comp -- February comp's sales in Canada by about 60 basis points. It impacted negatively other international by about 110 basis points and total company by about 20 basis points. Cannibalization was about a 10 basis point impact to the U.S., so a minus 140 basis point minus impact to other international and 30 basis points overall to the company. Moving to merchandise highlights, the following comparable sales results by category : food and sundries were positive in the low teens. Strongest departments included foods, frozen food, sundries and candy. Hardlines were positive in the high singles. Better-performing departments were lawn and garden, health and beauty, aids and tires. Softlines were up in the mid-single digits. Better-performing departments included; housewares, domestics and jewelry. And finally fresh foods were up in the low double digits. Better-performing departments included; meat and produce. Within ancillary, pharmacy, gas and hearing aids had some of the better comp sales increases in February. Gas price inflation, I think I mentioned this positively impacted total reported comp sales by about 50 basis points. Lastly, our comp traffic or frequency for February was up 9.2% worldwide and 8.9% in the U. S. Now given the impact in week four, where we really saw the big uptick, as I know many did out there, related to the concerns over coronavirus, the first three weeks within that 9.2% worldwide for four weeks. The first three weeks stood at 7.6%. And again, within the 8.9%, U. S. frequency number for the four weeks within that for the three weeks it was 6. 9%. So still a good showing prior to that. For February the average transaction was up 2.7%. Now turning to the coronavirus and all the issues and impact surrounding it. Like everyone, we are keeping a close eye on the developments around the coronavirus including the impact on operations; the health and safety of our members and employees and of course our supply chain. As already discussed, we saw strength in our February traffic and comp sales related to the news and concerns about the virus, most particularly in the last week of the month and that's continuing in the first few days of this week. Our warehouses have overall remained open with only a few total days of closures at a couple of locations in Korea. As well our Shanghai location there's been some limitations required on the number of people in the facility at any given time. Members are turning to us for a variety of items associated with preparing for and dealing with a virus, such as shelf stable dry grocery items, cleaning supplies, Clorox and Bleach, water, paper goods, hand sanitizers, sanitizing wipes disinfectants, health and beauty aids and even items like water filtration and food storage items. And we're doing our best to stay in stock on these and other items. We're getting deliveries daily but still not enough given the increased levels of demand on certain key items. It's been a little crazy this past week in terms of outside shopping frequency and sales levels and not only in the United States. In terms of placing quantity limits on what a member can purchase. We are doing that in some instances. It tends to be at all locations but may differ regionally based on supply levels. I do want to give three big shout outs. Our buying staffs both here, regionally and abroad are working in some cases around the clock to procure supplies for both existing suppliers and from other sources where possible. Second, a shout out to our warehouse employees. These last nine or so days has been beyond busy. Even with the traffic jams and the parking lots and the long lines and to check out they've been absolutely awesome. And anecdotally we're hearing that daily from members. We have a few other things occasionally too. And lastly our suppliers both domestically and abroad, we feel our strong long-term relationships have helped to this crisis. We've been there for them and they are certainly there for us now. Overall, in terms of what the coronavirus-related demand items \u2013 in terms of that, it's looking better but not perfect and we'll see what each day brings. At our warehouses, in terms of cleanliness and sanitizing, we have enhanced sanitizing protocols and safety procedures have been implemented in all the locations. Some examples, wiping down car handles with sanitizing wipes, placing of sanitizing wipes stands at entrances also along the fresh line wall at food courts. Enhanced procedures at the food courts, patio tables, condiment tables, dispensers and bed et cetera. The general things you might expect and that we see in all the recommendations. In terms of supply chain, closures of many manufacturing facilities extended well beyond the typical one week Chinese New Year holiday, which was the last week in January. In many cases factories over there were closed for one to two additional weeks. That's now improving each week. Initially two to three weeks of factory \u2013 so initially there are two to three weeks of factory closures not one. Then about three weeks ago and just pulling some of the buyers that \u2013 a deal with the factories they felt there was a rough number of 20% to 25% production levels, moving up to 40% and now as high as 60% to 80%. But again, it's improving and this still has a little ways to go. In terms of transportation issues, whether it's Chinese New Year and then a couple of additional closure weeks. There were not only product issues, but also trucking and port issues. These are also abating with port capacity in China improving each day as well. And I say port capacity; it's also the shipping lines that come to the various ports. Domestically, truck capacity is plentiful. However, exporting items including KS items as well as other U.S. manufactured items to our locations in Asia and Australia. It's been a little bit of a challenge because of some container shortages here. But, overall, okay, it just taken a little more work. We're finding other ways to handle any potential out of stocks by shifting SKUs to alternative items and categories, particularly in the areas of domestic goods, food and sundries and fresh. And as you might expect, our travel business is impacted due to reduced demand, as well as higher-than-normal cancellations of previously booked trips, particularly as it relates to cruises and international travel. I don't think there's any surprise with that. At this point, it's hard to quantify what the financial impact will be for our future results -- to our future results. Again, the first week-and-a-half of this fiscal quarter, it's been -- the last week-and-a-half has been quite good with the sales, but we'll see what tomorrow brings. We'll continue to pass that information along and, of course, we do report monthly sales results. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our March sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, April 5, on Wednesday, April 8, after the market closes. With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back over to Rochelle. Thank you. Operator : All right. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Hey, Richard. Can you hear me okay? Richard Galanti : Yes. Yeah. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Good. Thank you. First question is on the gross margin. I think if we take the core-on-core down 15% and you get rid of the chicken production costs, you're down 9%. Did you say within that? What the e-commerce mix shift is? And how that compares to prior quarters up to the prior run rate? Richard Galanti : We weren't that specific, but a lot of it has to do with the fact that, that one -- particularly, that one week, where it's so important to e-commerce on promotional items, for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, the weekend, the three days leading up to Thanksgiving, so you do have some lower-margin -- you have some lower-margin categories in there to start with, as well as, we do a lot more promotional stuff, as most retailers do, with that week of Thanksgiving. Simeon Gutman : Okay. So this was a little bit unusual, given the timing and given just the fourth quarter, or the holiday period was in that number? Richard Galanti : And I want to stand corrected, there's a couple of people here just correct me. The e-com numbers are not in the core-on-core. So that would be outside of that. Simeon Gutman : Got it. Okay. Richard Galanti : But it's still the strength in majors. Simeon Gutman : Right. Okay. Got it. But broadly speaking, the greater mix of e-com, Richard, is going to depress -- well, you're saying it's not in that number, but it's unfavorable to gross margin broadly, though, is that fair? And is that because of the mix of products that are being bought or because of the discounts or the markup that you're putting on those items. Richard Galanti : It's both. I mean, as we try to build new categories over the last year or so like apparel, we're giving some hot deals out there. If you buy one shirt, it's X if you buy two; it's a little less for delivery or whatever else. So, we're driving that business. And again we've talked about -- yes, but the big thing is electronics. Electronics tends to be a low-margin business not only TVs, but all the computer and phone things. Simeon Gutman : Got it. Okay. My follow-up is on just overall reinvestment, right? Your business is growing at a really high level, high single-digit comps. I'm not sure if you planned for that level and the core-on-core, in general, is doing relatively well. It's not down 20 or 30. And I guess the SG&A that you're spending seems somewhat in line. But I assume you're not flowing through all the leverage that's coming through this model. And so my question is where are you finding places to reinvest. Again it doesn't seem like the core-on-core is getting -- is going down enough to suggest you're putting it back in price. Are you finding other places to spend in SG&A? Richard Galanti : Well I'd argue that we are putting a lot of it back in price. Keep in mind of all the buckets we talked about historically from the membership fee income to the tax reform to the changing credit card, those things keep growing and it allows us to be competitive. And when we see strong sales, I think it encourages us to do more of that. And the other thing is I'm not going to go through 10 different things, but there's lots of things. We're very busy. It's not just the five basis points I mentioned in IT. We got a lot going on with the e-com fulfillment, with the chicken complex which I mentioned, there's a lot -- with the CCPA. These are small things but each of these are various numbers of basis points. CCPA is the privacy -- California Privacy Act. We don't point it out because I'm sure there's something that goes the other way sometimes. But at the end of the day, there's a lot of things going on and we feel pretty good about where our expenses are, in other words, we're going to try to improve them. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Gregory Melich : Hi, thanks. Richard two things I wanted to follow-up. One is on the membership fee income could you give us what that is in constant currency. And also if you're seeing any membership sign-ups in Flex like the way sales and traffic have in the last couple of weeks? Richard Galanti : Its $2 million, is it? $2 million? It's $2 million even with FX. Gregory Melich : Once we adjust for that. Got it. And then on the sign-ups, have you seen any change there in the rate of sign ups? Richard Galanti : I honestly don't know. I know even a few people -- I mean the shopping frequency is off the charts for the last few days. And you see it on social media with people sending in pictures. So, I've got to believe there's been a little bit of it but not enough to move the needle. Gregory Melich : Got it. And then secondly was just on gasoline. What -- did you have the average selling price this quarter? And if you have any sort of trends on the gallons would be great as well. Richard Galanti : I don't have it in front of me. I know that there was -- gas was inflationary, correct? I think -- in Q2, it was 7.9% inflationary. Gregory Melich : Inflationary. And that's the average selling price per gallon versus a year ago? Richard Galanti : Yes. $2.75 versus $2.55. Gregory Melich : Got it. And then last I'll sneak in things. I know its coming. The balance sheet, very strong, more volatile markets, how should we think about buyback capital structure in the current rate environment and environment of the world? Richard Galanti : Well, every banker calls us every day to let us know that rates are even lower today time to borrow. But, no, look we continue to look at it. We talked about it in every Board meeting and all I can tell you is stay tuned. Gregory Melich : All right. Thanks. Good luck guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good evening. So a few follow-ups. First on March, I mean you are limiting some of those high-volume items. It does look like you've got some pretty low in stocks out there. Do you see the potential for comp risk later this month? Richard Galanti : Well, we don't know. People have asked us what happens when people have been bulking up on certain items. And, yes, there's out of stocks every day too. But overall the numbers are incredible because there's so many people coming in. And they're buying other stuff as well. So I don't know what tomorrow brings. When asked the question, are the people then go through this additional purchasing of water and shelf-stable food items and everything, I guess it depends. Are some of them putting it in their basements for another day, some of it related to the fact that people aren't eating out as much. I think it's a combination of those factors. All we know is that last week starting Tuesday or Wednesday, which is when a lot of the news went even -- went -- in the U.S. went even further we had a huge pickup in traffic, which continued over the weekend and increased, and increased the first few days of this even further in the first few days of this month -- this week. And so we'll see what tomorrow brings. And again on the supply side, there is clearly not just -- at Costco and other places you really can't go in and generally find sanitizing items and what have you. And while we're getting shipments daily somewhere in the U.S. whatever limited amounts we get or allocated is gone pretty quickly. And I would assume that over the next few weeks or several weeks that will abate. But it depends what else happens with the virus itself. Chris Horvers : Yeah. I was at a store on Saturday. I've never -- right after they open. I've never seen a line that all the way back to dairy. The -- my follow-up question is this might be hard to parse out, but I think the big question on investors' minds is how the consumer is going to behave. Obviously you have the pantry load, but you also sell a lot of general merchandise, you also sell a lot of big ticket. So were you able to tease out if you're seeing any pullback relative to trend in the past week or so in some of the more discretionary and larger ticket categories? Richard Galanti : Yeah. What's interesting, I'm just looking at some hand-written notes from our -- I spoke to our senior buyers yesterday. You would think things like patio furniture would be impacted because it's a big ticket discretionary items. The comment was we're selling it extremely well. Now part of that is we've got a bunch more people coming in, so maybe per customer -- the purchase per customer is down a little but there's a lot more customers. And so -- and -- what else lawn and garden is doing well. The buyers' view is that's more weather related in certain markets. There has been some impact in -- excuse me? Chris Horvers : Did you say TV? Were you going to say TV? Richard Galanti : No lawn and garden are weather related. And then in some electronics items, while some are strong, there's others like some laptops and some phones where there's been some supply chain issues. But I would say, overall the initial thought -- my initial thought is that, big-ticket discretionary items might be negatively impacted right now. To the extent they are, it's been more than offset at least in these last several days by the influx of shopping frequency. I don't know what that means for tomorrow we'll have to see. Chris Horvers : Understood and super helpful. And I'm sure all the media outlets are picking this a lot. My other question, two quick ones; one is, have you expanded the number of SKUs in the MVM. It seems to have picked up over the past couple of months, but wanted to get your thoughts there? And then lastly it looks like you have a new grocery delivery option in the app and on your website sort of an extended delivery option, not the 2-day and not the same day. So sort of what's been the strategy there? And is that new? Or just a repackaging of something you already have? Richard Galanti : Generally there's been no change in MVM items. I mean if it's up a little or down a little I think that's random not planned. And as it relates to shipping at least the people in the room with me here are not aware of that. Was it? Chris Horvers : Okay. It must be just a repackaging of something that you already have. Yes. Okay, thanks very much. Best of luck. Richard Galanti : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. John Parke : This is actually John Parke on for Chuck. Can you guys provide a little bit of an update on the performance of same-day and Costco 2-day and how that's impacting kind of total spend from these customers that are utilizing it? Richard Galanti : It's still relatively new for us over the last year. Overall in -- my knowledge of this is a couple of months old. It's a slight improvement. The concern of course is as they buy more having delivered in one day and two day and then they come in less frequently. But how less frequently and they are coming in a little less regularly but the sum of the two still is fine. Again it's too early to tell in our view just fine continue? Or does it change a little bit. We're still -- but keep in mind also, we continue to do a lot of things consciously even through e-mails to get you come back in the location with certain promotional things that are in-store only. John Parke : Got it. And then I guess, just going back to the coronavirus. I mean, is there any way to kind of indicate whether the margin on these sales are materially different than your traditional shop? Richard Galanti : Food sundries overall is -- yes, it's about in line, I would say, on the company averages. John Parke : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open. Karen Short : Thank you so much. A couple of questions, you -- Richard, you commented on the fresh gross margin decline. And I'm wondering if you could just give a little bit of color on that, and that's obviously excluding the poultry. You kind of called that a step-up in price investments? Richard Galanti : Yes. We're just -- I mean, at the end of the day, our heart is we're merchants, and we try to drive business. And fresh is an area that also is a frequency driver. So it's more -- my comment is more anecdotal than some new change in strategy. Karen Short : But not necessarily -- also comment on the competitive landscape. Richard Galanti : No that is \u2013 the increased level of competition that I've talked about that goes back a year and a half plus ago. And that hasn't changed. Karen Short : Okay. And then can you just maybe clarify a little bit on the \u2013 I guess the true-up of the breakage estimates. Richard Galanti : Well, I mean at the end of the day it's a small amount of basis points. When we issue a significant amount \u2013 you can kind of back into the number yourself of what percentage of our sales are the 2% reward. And we send out those certificates and there's always going to be some slippage. Notwithstanding the fact that, we send out reminders to our members that you haven't cashed this. At the end of the day we tend to be \u2013 we do our best guess to accrue for slippage. And I'd like to think that we tend to be a little conservative. And therefore when there's a review it picks up the other way. But at the end of the day we \u2013 accounting rules say, you do your best guess of what it should be. And then when you re-review it you adjust that. Karen Short : Okay. And then I just want to switch gears to the Shanghai store and I think you said you you'll be opening a second one soon. But maybe any thoughts on what you think the actual annual volumes could and will settle out at for that store? And then any update on the number of members at that store since the last call. And then I mean, I ask it in the context that to the extent that China is an opportunity, it's not so much about the units. It's actually about the volume per unit. Richard Galanti : Right. Well, it's hard to say because this one is so off the charts. I mean, again the last few weeks \u2013 the last several weeks with some limitations on number of members for some of that period of time, it's changed a little bit. But I mean that was either a top or second largest location in our company for the several weeks leading up to that. And the number of members is again off the charts. Nearly five times the company. Karen Short : Okay. And but would we take that same number and apply that to the total revenue for that box? Or how should we think about that? Richard Galanti : No, no, no. Because given the population of Shanghai and the fact that this thing went throughout social media and it was very popular over there. You have a somewhat higher renewal rate, we don't know yet because we opened it in August. But we know from other countries \u2013 I'm sorry, lower \u2013 lower rental rate. And no and you can't just simply multiply that out. But our \u2013 but the unit overall is again either number one or two, up until the last few weeks with what's going on over there with coronavirus was one of our top two units. Karen Short : Okay. And then just last question for me. I don't think I've asked this for a while but do you have any \u2013 are you willing to give an update on what you think or what the \u2013 where the average ticket is in the U.S. of an executive member today versus just the basic membership and how that's trended in the last several years? Because it does seem like the momentum is really continuing to increase in terms of your share gains? Richard Galanti : Yes. Look, we don't disclose that but more executive members and more penetration of executive members is good. More members who have the \u2013 in the case of the United States, the co-brand credit card is good. And if they have both in the executive and that it's even better. All those things I think are \u2013 help our sales growth. Karen Short : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is open. John Heinbockel : Richard, the price investments you mentioned in fresh food, was that actually proactive price investments or more delays in passing through vendor increases? And then, where those investments occurred, was that more protein as opposed to other categories? Richard Galanti : It's definitely proactive on our part. And, I think, it's all of the above. It's protein. It's fresh -- I mean its produce. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then, if you -- I mean if you look at the fresh food comp, right, so I think you said low double-digit and that included the final week, right? So, that was the best fresh food comp you've had in a while. I don't know if you can parse out and maybe you can with -- looking at the final week, how much -- was some of that coronavirus related, or was a lot of that step-up related to the price investments? Richard Galanti : Who knows? Clearly, week four was different than weeks one, two and three, for everything. And just a sheer number of people coming into the warehouse. I personally believe that given that restaurants probably have been impacted a little bit the last couple of weeks. They're buying more at supermarkets and more at Costco, so those things help a little bit as well. John Heinbockel : And then, lastly, when you think about it -- and I know you said the margin on some of that stuff is sort of in line with the average. When you think about the -- sort of, the cost associated with restocking and dealing with that volume and you think about, I don't know, an EBIT margin tied to the volume. Normally, the EBIT margin will be -- the incremental margin will be a lot higher. Is that less the case here because of the cost required to keep up with that volume? Richard Galanti : Well, yeah, I think, there's a lot of additional things that cost you. I mean, there's not a lot of it, but I'm sure there's a little air freight going on. And I'm sure there's -- when you've got a high-cube, high-weight, low-value items like water, for the hectoliter it's for $2.99 or something, and you're going through it faster than you could put it on the floor. There's more labor and everything else. But it's still a net positive. In the scheme of things, I don't know if it helps or hurts the bottom a little bit. So. Okay. Yes. And the other thing is, they're not just coming and getting those five items and moving. They're shopping a little bit. Again, I personally was surprised that patio furniture is strong. And maybe per person it's a little weaker, but there's a lot more persons. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from Nomura. Your line is open. Mike Baker : Okay. Thanks. A couple of questions. One, can you tell us how gas profits were this year versus last year. And then, remind us if you could, how much that helped 2Q, 2019, versus 2Q, 2018. Richard Galanti : I believe -- I don't have it in front of me, but I believe last year we said gas helped us, relative to the prior year. It was pretty -- it wasn't worth talking about, plus or minus either way. Mike Baker : Okay. Richard Galanti : This year versus last. Mike Baker : Got it. Okay. Shifting gears a couple more, if I could. So, February, even if you take out -- first of all, the 300 basis points, can we take that out pro rata across international and the U.S.? Or is it that impacts one region more than the other? And the real question is, when you strip that out, February was much stronger than you've been running, even so? In other words, I presume the first three weeks were strong. So what do you think is behind that uptick, even before you got to week four? Richard Galanti : It must be those investments in price. No, at the end of the day it is generally around the world. I think Korea has been a little less of that probably a little less of that benefit. But there's been -- there was an outbreak there that had a lot of publicity and I think there were more people perhaps staying home are not going out. The -- but when I look at U.S., Canada, and several other countries, all of them had big upticks in that last -- the past nine or so days. And I'm sorry what was the last part of the question? Mike Baker : Just why do you think weeks one -- so weeks one, two and three were obviously strong as well because when you take out that 300 basis points, it's still -- you're high single digits. So, what do you think is behind that big uptick? Richard Galanti : There's probably lots of little things I'd like -- my mother would say we're good merchants and great stuff at low prices. There's nothing that stands out completely. And certainly there was not a lot of press out there issues around coronavirus even though was in the news a little bit. So, maybe on a macro basis, there's a little bit of that in there. I think there may have been some weather issues a year ago that may have impacted a little. But overall, we were -- in those three weeks, forgetting about week four, which was off the charts, it was -- we're feeling pretty good about it that some of the stuff we're doing is working from a merchandising standpoint and a pricing standpoint. Mike Baker : Okay, fair enough. Appreciate the time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Rupesh Parikh : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and thanks for all the comments on the coronavirus. So, I guess, Richard, just going back to your commentary on the supply chain. So, as you guys look forward, at this point, do you expect any impact on your supply chain-related to coronavirus or is it too early to tell earlier in the year? Richard Galanti : Well, I think -- first of all, there has been an impact on it. It's now starting to get a little bit further than normal back to normal on regular stuff. On some of the virus-related items that people are buying like water and sanitizing items and paper tiles and things like that, that's going to take a little bit while longer. When I ask the buyers they're working day-to-day with suppliers. You've got suppliers that are literally working around the clock to produce and to ship. But again people are coming in and buying stuff, if you will, for their basement. Rupesh Parikh : And what about -- I guess I was asking more on some of the other categories like electronics. And some of those categories that may come from Asia. Just curious if you expect an impact? Richard Galanti : Well, I think I mentioned there have been -- we have seen some little impact on some laptops and some cell phones and I think that's related to some of the things that we all read about in the paper about some shortage -- some delays because of some of the component parts. I think one thing that helps us a little as we're able to pivot a little bit. So, if there was a shortage or something with one area, we're able to put something else in its place since we sell pretty much everything. But we just don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. First order of business is to get the supply chains back open and running well. There are two kinds of supply chain issues. There's a supply chain issue related to all these very high demand items related to fighting and protecting yourself; the waters, the sanitizing, and things like that. And then there's just stuff, I mean everything from furniture to apparel to electronics coming from China. And on the latter, it seems at least while the one week -- and keep in mind given, the planned Chinese New Year week, there were stuff bought in early not only by us, but I'm sure others and so -- but then there's two more weeks of closures. So, those kind of things over the last three weeks in terms of talking about buyers, the supply chain has -- and the manufacturers are now back open they went from zero if you will the 25% to 40% to 50% to 60%, 80% and now it's getting to the ports. And some of those things are also being abated, some of the issues there. So my guess is if everything got better tomorrow from a concern standpoint, you still have a few weeks here where it takes time to fill those supply chains. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And one follow-up question. Just on the holiday season. You guys had a really strong performance even with fewer selling days, so just curious if there's any surprises or what do you think contributed to the really strong outperformance? Richard Galanti : Well, I think we -- this is -- that's what we do. I mean, I think we've done a great job. We've been helped by strong big-ticket categories like electronics, like patio furniture and lawn and garden right now and other hardlines and softlines areas. Fresh continues to drive our business. We -- as you know when we're asked what are the two or three big factors that drive our business -- or of categories. It's fresh, it's gas, it's executive membership. And again utilizing those different bucket -- even when sales are good, we want to be aggressive in pricing. And when sales are bad, we want to be aggressive more aggressive in pricing. When the sales are good, we want to be more aggressive in pricing. It drives -- the top line improvements drive the bottom line. Rupesh Parikh : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Good afternoon, guys. Richard, you talked about expecting margin pressure to moderate a bit from the poultry plant ramp. And I know there was an incubation period there. So is that plant actually turning out product at this point? And related to that can you give us an idea of what the incremental benefit you guys are expecting once you're in full production mode? Richard Galanti : Well, I think it was mid-September when we -- when the first chicken went through the plan if you will. The plan was that 45 weeks later there would be approximately 2.2 million birds a week being processed. And so call it September to August. And so we're a little bit past the halfway mark on that. And I believe in terms of production, we're a little bit past the halfway mark on that. Call it one million birds a week. It should be off a little bit on either side. And so a lot of this has to do with the fact that you've got this big facility that is running at well below capacity. The amount of impairment to margin related to that in Q2 was less than Q1. We would expect it to be less than in Q3 and further. So once we get the full capacity I think -- and then I'm sure there's going to be some operational improvements over the first couple of years as well. At the end of the day, it's a combination of sourcing just simpler supply. And our view is, is we can improve if you will the ultimate cost per bird. But we don't know that yet. We spent a little more than we planned, but we also upgraded the facility to be air chilled instead of water chilled. It truly is a state-of-the-art facility for the U.S. and a very high volume facility. And I would say, right now, things are going as planned in terms of that 45-week cycle. And I would like to think that a year from now -- six months from now or two more quarters from now, it's not going to be an issue that we really even talk about as it relates to how it impacted margin. Scot Ciccarelli : Got you. I appreciate that. Richard Galanti : A little bit. I don't think it'll be that wrong. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. And then I know you obviously had the surge in that kind of fourth week, as you pointed out, because of the coronavirus. Warehouses were obviously jammed. Everyone kind of sees that. But I'm curious if you happen to see an even larger increase from e-comm in terms of -- like has there been some sort of shift in consumer behavior at all? Or is all the activity concentrated on warehouses? Richard Galanti : No. I mean we saw an increase but not really. I mean mind you that -- we saw -- yes throughout February we saw some increase in e-commerce. But again if people are looking for those -- the sense of urgency I'm going out right now and get it in things like water and everything. And some of those key items like peanut butter and crackers and the like, we have online as well. And those too in some regions there might be in and out of stocks. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. All right, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line Judah Frommer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Judah Frommer : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was hoping maybe you could help us with kind of how things trended in Korea over the last few weeks. You have exposure there potentially weeks ahead of where the U.S. could be worst-case scenario for the virus. So in terms of demand and kind of stock up and then potentially demand falling off as the virus spread there any insights there? Richard Galanti : Well I think the only insight is -- from what I've read it is not -- is the issue that more people are staying at home and not even going out. Whereas even near the -- I love the publicity that the state of Washington and King County is getting with a few of the -- there are people out and about. There's a little less traffic on the highways. And -- but notwithstanding that that's some highways coming to see us. Judah Frommer : Got it. And then kind of changing gears. We've seen some stuff about potentially requiring membership and some food courts in the press, anything behind the thought process there? Richard Galanti : Well first of all, it's gotten more press than it deserves. There are I believe seven current locations on the West Coast where we -- and I believe they are all outdoor locations. And one of the challenges that we've had is, particularly on very busy locations where people that are non members just come and eat there every day. You've got member complaints saying, why are you -- I have to pay the come to Costco. And so we took -- we're testing it in seven locations that we are limiting it to members only. It's easy in locations where you have the food court inside. But on -- and many of the ones in areas where the weather is generally good like California, Arizona and things like that you have a lot of them are outside. And so we'll see. But that's -- but again, seven locations out of 540, we're testing it at and it's gotten a lot of press. Judah Frommer : Okay, got it. And if I could squeeze in one more, anything on supply in pharmacy and any people stocking up there and potentially running out of inventory? Richard Galanti : This is just a quote from the FDA yesterday and said well the FDA and other outlets are reporting disruptions and medical products are possible. At this time manufacturers are reporting that no specific drugs are experienced in shortage due to the impact of COVID-19. And talking to our Head of Pharmacy yesterday, he said the only thing that we've seen there's been a little pickup there as well. Let's say somebody has a year-long prescription. So four nine -- a prescription plus 990-day refills for -- and they'll come in and they'll want all four of them filled now. And in some cases even when their particular insurance plan doesn't cover it, they're paying cash. They're just hoarding -- they're hoarding up on their prescription to make sure we're not running out. But that's more again, I think the same thing you're seeing with paper goods. But from a supply and availability standpoint, but we haven't seen anything yet. Judah Frommer : Okay. Thanks. Richard Galanti : Why don't we take two more questions. Operator : Okay. Next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen. Your line is open. Oliver Chen : Hi, Richard, regarding the supply chain and what you're seeing, what are your thoughts regarding the price increases or potential price increases, whether that be from transportation costs or other and what your buyers think may happen there. And the second question is related to e-commerce. You made a lot of progress on your mobile app. Just what's ahead for changes to the mobile app? And also more broadly, capital investments related to e-comm and supply chain? Thank you. Richard Galanti : As it relates to costs, the general view of the buyers is, is that we have \u2013 I get back to the comment I made earlier about strong relations. To the extent that there's some raw materials cost increases because of shortages, that's going to rain on everybody. In our view, it rains on us a little less. But I think we \u2013 given the limited number of items we buy and the amount of things we \u2013 the amount of any given item that we buy, our buyers, we feel, know a lot more about the cost structure. And so I haven't seen any commentary on that internally other than there was one small comment I can't find it in my mess of papers here, that there may be \u2013 in some small cases, some raw material increases on some particular item \u2013 some particular raw material for some manufacturing process. But overall, there's not been a big issue. Right now, the only increase in transportation has some very limited items where there's been a little bit of airfreight, what we're finding is, is that the ports are getting back to capacity and there's plenty of space. And so that's not been as big an issue. As it relates to an e-comm investment. There's not a lot I have my plate to tell you today, we're working on more things related to our app, to our membership digital app. And we certainly have some things going on on the fulfillment side of e-commerce. And we've been focused on getting two more countries opened, as I mentioned in the last quarter. And we think \u2013 there are a few other things that we've got going on that I'll be happy to chat with the next time around. Oliver Chen : Okay. And is buy online, pick up in-store going as you like? And do you expect a lot of enhancements ahead to that as customers like it? Richard Galanti : Well, customers like it, but we don't like it necessarily. We're doing buy online and pick up in-store for some small items \u2013 small high-value items. But we're not at the point where we're looking for members to buy online they come up and pick up their whole grocery baskets. So we're trying to figure out our way. And certainly \u2013 again, the last nine or so days notwithstanding, seems \u2013 things seem to be working pretty well for us in that regard. We continue to work on the \u2013 where we've had good sales and good strength over the last few years in e-commerce is taking certain big and bulky things out of the warehouse, white goods and things that are delivered, in some cases, installed, and so we continue to work on those kind of things as well. Oliver Chen : And lastly, Richard, with the surge in demand and the traffic trends that you've seen, how have you managed, like, this customer and guest satisfaction and also labor in your stores, those kinds of things that we're curious about? Richard Galanti : How do we measure it? Oliver Chen : How have you managed it? And just -- and tried your best to make sure that customers are happy. And also, you have the appropriate labor levels, relative to spikes and changes in demand. Richard Galanti : Well, again, the last week-and-a-half notwithstanding, because it's been nuts. No, first of all, member comments and basic member renewal rates. I mean, we actually -- the operators and all the way up to Craig, see weekly information on comments. You can't imagine how many people call and e-mail when to have something that they're concerned about. And we also measure the least expected, but the positive letters to that effect. On the operations side, the key is still -- well, aside from merchandising, the art of merchandising out there and giving the warehouse managers the assistant managers and the merchandisers -- whereas merchandisers some leeway, not -- I mean, certainly electronics is when you walk in and there's defensive promotional goods and fresh is in the back. But the end of the day, there is a bit of merchandising that is pushed down to the regional and warehouse level. And that's what, I think, drives our business there. In terms of the front end, managing the front end, I think, we've got less count, 120 of our 540-ish locations in the U.S. with self-checkout. And we plan another 100 in the next three months. And so, always trying to figure out and measuring the number of transact -- number of member transactions through the front end per hour. Oliver Chen : Great. Thank you. Best regards. Great job. Operator : Next question from the line of Peter Benedict from Baird. Your line is open. Peter Benedict : Hey, Richard, just two quick ones here to close out. So, it looks like the business probably comping in the 20% range there in that last week and, certainly, the demand is probably even higher than that, just given that you guys are running out towards the end of the day. How do you think about the ability for the club to kind of keep up that pace -- with that pace of demand? I mean, if this were to go on for three, four more weeks. Do you guys think you've got the supply chain able to keep up with that level of demand? Or are you hitting a point where you're not -- you're just not going to get another delivery tomorrow of pick your category? Richard Galanti : Yes. No. Well, I think, it's all over the board. Yesterday, I think, there was a couple of -- either Los Angeles or San Diego counties that announced a heightened level of concern. King County here in Seattle did that a couple of days ago. When that happens, that's another catalyst to puts people to go out and get more stuff. I would hope -- and, look, we would all hope this thing peaks and starts to slow down. It depends what happens tomorrow. We'll be tired, but still working hard. Given that half of our employees -- roughly -- a little over half of our -- of the 90% of employees in our warehouses that are hourly, about a little over half of those 90% are full-time and a little under half of are part-time. Certainly, there are employees that want to work more than part-time and so we've been able to accommodate some additional hours there. But everybody is a little tired but that's what you do. Peter Benedict : Okay. And then my last question is just on lawn and garden, you mentioned that a couple of times and you talked about seasonal. Maybe expand on that a little bit. Where in particular are you seeing the strong -- I guess, it's an early start to spring, but maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing on that front? Richard Galanti : Well, the only thing I mentioned there was that in -- and getting ready for today's call, I had spoken to several of the senior merchants in the different categories. And one thing without even looking at the numbers I thought is I assume some of the big ticket discretionary items might be a little weaker because people are not running in to get those items. They're running in to get other concerned items. And the fact was to my surprise that they said that certain items like patio furniture and lawn and garden was strong. They felt -- and again it was just their view that patio -- lawn and garden was more related to some of the areas of the country where the weather has turned already. And -- but clearly because you got X percent more people coming in every day than normal. Peter Benedict : That makes sense. Fair enough. Thanks so much. Richard Galanti : Okay. Well thank you everyone. Have a good afternoon and we're around to answer any questions. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And please note that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. And I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. Please go ahead, sir. Richard Galanti : Thank you Joseph and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the 12 weeks ended May 10. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $838 million or $1.89 per diluted share. This compared to $906 million or $2.05 per diluted share last year in the third quarter. Now, this year's third quarter was negatively impacted by direct expenses of $283 million pretax or $0.47 per diluted share from incremental wage, safety and sanitation costs related to COVID-19 and last year's third quarter number of $2.05 included the benefit from a nonrecurring tax item of $73 million or $0.16 per diluted share. Net sales for the quarter increased 7.3% to $36.45 billion, up from $33.96 billion last year in the third quarter. On a same-store comparable sales basis for the third quarter, for the 12 weeks on a reported basis, the U.S. was at 5.9%. Excluding gas deflation and FX impact, the 5.9% would have been for the 12 weeks an 8.0%. Canada on a reported basis was minus 2.5%, ex gas deflation and FX plus 3.0%. Other international came in on a reported basis at 6.2% and again ex gas deflation and FX, plus 12.2%. All told, the total company came in with a reported 4.8% and again ex gas deflation and FX, the 4.8% would have been 7.8%. I might also note that e-commerce on a reported basis was 64.5% comp and ex gas deflation or ex FX, 66.1%. Now foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 110 basis points and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 190 basis points for the total company therefore to 300 basis points. Additionally, gasoline volumes or gallons were down about 20% year-over-year in the quarter as a result of less driving due to the pandemic. The impact of gasoline gallons is not in the adjusted figures that I just described above. In terms of traffic, our shopping frequency decreased in the quarter worldwide by 4.1% and in the U.S. by 2.0%. Our average transaction or ticket was up 9.3% during the third quarter and the 9.3% does include the negative impacts from gas deflation and FX. Now, our third quarter comp sales figures did reflect also that a few of our businesses, notably optical, hearing aids and photo were closed for much of Q3 and a good portion of our food court item offerings were eliminated also for much of Q3 as well we eliminated the food court seating during this time. Reopenings of these began, the ones that were closed, began on April 30, 10 days prior to the third quarter end with about 20% of the locations back to operating by Q3 end. In the past two to three weeks, nearly all will be back in operation by mid-June. In terms of the food courts which have been open but again a much more limited menu, we have added some but not all the items back as of now. In all, an estimated hit to the reported sales numbers that we gave you earlier in Q3 by one to two percentage points by those items being closed or restricted. Next on the income statement. Membership fee income reported came in at $815 million or 2.24%, up 5% or $39 million from $776 million or 2.9% last year in Q3. Ex FX weakness, the $39 million increase and 5% increase would have been up $47 million or 6%. During the quarter, we had two new openings and a total of four year-to-date. In terms of renewal rates, at Q3 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate came in at 91.0%, a tick up from where we were at Q2 end and the worldwide rate came in at 88.4%, the same as it was a fiscal quarter ago. Keep in mind that any impact on renewal rates from COVID, positive or negative, are reflected over the next several months. In terms the number of members at Q3 end, member households and cardholders. In terms of households, we ended the third quarter with 55.8 million households, up from 55.3 million 12 weeks earlier. And total cardholders came in at 101.8 million, up from 100.9 million 12 weeks earlier. At Q3 end, paid executive memberships came in at 21.8 million, an increase of 135,000 over the last 12 weeks. Going down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin was higher year-over-year by 54 basis points on a reported basis, coming in at 11.53%, up from 10.99%. Now, the 54, ex gas deflation would have been plus 33 basis points. As I usually do, I will ask you to write down a few numbers in two columns and then we will go through that explanation. In terms reported, in Q3 2020 year-over-year, the core merchandise was up 51 basis points on a reported basis and without gas deflation up 33. Ancillary businesses was on a reported basis plus 26 basis points, ex gas deflation plus 21. The 2% reward, minus six and minus four basis points. Other, minus 17 and minus 17. And you add up those two columns, total reported again up 54 basis points on a reported basis and up 33 basis points. And gross margin was up 33 basis points, ex-gas deflation. Now, the core merchandise component of gross margin again higher by 51 or 33 ex deflation. Keep in mind that in the quarter, we had a decent sales shift from ancillary and other businesses to core businesses which resulted in a higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core. Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to only their own sales or what we call core-on-core, margins year-over-year were lower by 17 basis points. Five basis points, by the way, which was losses related to our new poultry complex. This is something I have pointed out in the last two quarters and will probably do so next quarter as well. In total, pretty similar in fact to our year-over-year impact in Q2. So while higher penetration of our total sales came from the core this year, it was at a slightly lower gross margin percentage year-over-year. This is mostly attributed to sales mix, both between and within merchandise categories. Our fresh foods gross margin percentage was up, again despite any first-year headwinds from the ramp up process associated with poultry complex. The strength in fresh was a result of high sales, driving down our spoilage as well as labor costs as a percent of sales, being able to leverage those at a normal rate. Softlines, food and sundries and hardlines, all had lower margin percentage year-over-year in the quarter. One example, non-foods which is both hardlines and softlines. Non-foods was impacted by shift in sales towards lower margin departments, particularly things like majors and big-ticket electronics. Ancillary and other business gross margin in the two columns, higher by 26 basis points. And again, 21 higher basis points ex gas deflation. This result was primarily due to strength in gas and e-com gross margin dollars year-over-year, partially offset by lower penetration of ancillary sales due to lower gas prices and volumes and closures of some of those ancillary businesses that I talked about earlier. Several of those businesses have higher gross margins. 2% reward was higher or was a hit to gross margin by six basis points on a reported basis and four ex deflation, implying that slightly higher percentage of our sales were eligible for the executive member reward. The other line item, 17 basis points to the negative. 12 of the 17 basis points is attributable to the COVID costs and the 12 basis points, that's about $44 million of the $283 million number that was mentioned in the press release. These are the costs for incremental wages, safety and sanitation costs allocated to our cost departments and merchandise fulfillment operations. So it hits the margin. The other five basis points or $19.7 million came from accruing reserve for certain third-party gift cards and ticket programs. This latter $19.7 million was not included in the $283 million total amount that we called out as a direct incremental expenses from COVID. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A percentage year-over-year was higher by 59 basis points, coming in at 10.51% of sales, up from 9.92%. Ex gas deflation, the minus 59 would have been minus 40 or higher by 40. If you would again please jot down the following SG&A components and then we will go through that. Core operations reported was plus nine or lower by nine, a benefit of nine. Ex gas deflation, plus 24 or a benefit of 24 basis points. Central was zero and plus two. Stock compensation, plus three and plus three. Other, minus 71 and minus 69. And you add up those two columns, you get to the reported SG&A increase of 59 basis points and ex gas and FX -- ex gas deflation, rather, minus 40 or by a higher by 40 basis points. Now again, the core operations component lower by nine and ex gas deflation lower by 24. SG&A in the core operations, that's excluding the COVID-related expenses that I will talk about in the minute, they were, needless to say, leveraged with strong core merchandise sales. Central was essentially flat and a slight improvement relative to the including the ex gas deflation. Stock comp, no surprises there. It was a slight benefit to SG&A by three basis points. And again the other component of 71 or 69 ex gas deflation, of the 71, 66 basis points of the 71 is attributable to the incremental costs of COVID-19 or $239 million of that $283 million total amount that was in the press release. Again these are the cost for incremental wages and safety and sanitation related to direct expenses. The balance of the 71 basis point figure was five basis points or $18.5 million, this came from the costs associated with the acquisition and integration-related expenses of our recent acquisition of Innovel, that last mile delivery and installation operation for big and bulky that we acquired a few months ago. Next on the income statement is pre-opening expense. Pre-opening expense was lower by $6 million, coming in at $8 million in the quarter versus $14 million a year ago. Again, we had two openings this year. Last year in the quarter, we had three. Although, chunks of each of these numbers relate to pending openings in Q4 as well. All told, reported operating income in the third quarter of 2020 increased by 5.1%, coming in at $1,179 million this year, compared to $1,122 million a year ago. Now this 5% increase is notwithstanding the incremental cost that I just talked about, the $283 million as well as the $19.7 million and the $18.5 million that I just mentioned as well. Those are all taken in the third quarter. Below the operating income line. Interest expense was higher year-over-year by $2 million coming in at $37 million this year in the quarter versus $35 million a year ago. Recall, that we completed a $4 billion debt offering on April 20 during the third quarter. Following the completion of the debt offering, we called the outstanding debt due May of 2021. That was a $1 billion tranche and an additional $5 million tranche that was due in February 2022. Both of these tranches, we have paid off this morning after a 30-day call notice. There will be a pretax expense of $36 million related to the earlier time and our make-whole of this debt which will hit our Q4 results on the interest income and other line in our P&L. Next on the income statement, interest income and other for the quarter. It was lower by $15 million year-over-year, mostly attributed to lower interest income and mostly attributed to lower interest rates within that. Overall, reported pretax income in Q3 of fiscal 2020 was up 3.6%, coming in at $1,163 million versus $1,123 million last year and again the $1,163 million is after taking the impacts of those charges that I previously mentioned. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q3 this year was 26.7%. Last year, it was 18.5% tax rate. Again, last year, it included a benefit of a nonrecurring tax item of $73 million. A few other items of note in terms of warehouse expansion. As I mentioned, we opened two units in the third quarter. That puts us at five, actually five units total through the first three quarters. We expect in Q4 to open 10 including two relos, so net of eight. So it looks like our net total this year will be somewhere around 13. There's been a few that have been impacted by COVID-19 in terms of construction delays and have been pushed into the first part of fiscal 2021 which starts in early September. As of Q3 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 115 million square feet. In terms of capital expenditures, the third quarter of fiscal 2020 total spend was approximately $626 million and our estimated CapEx for all of fiscal 2020 is currently in the $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion range, a slight decline from what where we had guesstimated and estimated a quarter ago. And again, I think that has to do with some of the delays in construction since this COVID issue. In terms of e-commerce. As I mentioned earlier, overall our e-commerce sales on a reported basis increased 64.5% and 66.1% ex FX. I should note that within that 61%, like many retailers out there, we saw an increasingly level of strength in e-commerce sales over the last few months. If I look through the 12 week, the three four-week periods that comprise our 12 week third quarter, roughly that 64.5% reported number in the first four weeks was in the 25% range, in the next four weeks in the 50% increased range and the most recent in the last four weeks in the 90% range, but totaling that 64.5% on a reported basis. A few of the stronger departments, health and beauty aids, office, majors, housewares and small electrics. Total online grocery grew at an incredible rate during the third quarter, as I am sure did at many places. The comp numbers just mentioned again follow, that's the 64% number, they follow our historical convention where we exclude our third-party or same-day grocery program since that comes into the warehouse to be picked up by the third-party and delivered to our member. If we were to include that third-party in our e-commerce number, that mid 60% comp number would be slightly over 100%. So we have seen big strength in driving the business that way. Overall, our e-com sites have worked pretty smoothly during the quarter despite dramatic volume increases and as well we were able to improve on delivery times throughout the quarter as we adjusted to the ramped up order volumes. Now turning to Coronavirus and all the issues and impacts surrounding it. From a sales perspective, as discussed last quarter and indicated by our monthly sales results that we do, we started Q3 strong. I think it started actually in the fourth week of February and then into the first two-and-half weeks of March with very strong sales as people were stocking up prior to the implementation, the concern about availability of certain key products as well as the implementation of various stay at home orders. The middle of the quarter was weaker as many of geographies in which we operate had issued mandates limiting movement as well we had implemented our own restrictions during these times. Recently our sales have started to recover somewhat as states have begun to relax restrictions. Within the merchandise categories, foods, fresh and other essentials have been very strong despite out of stocks on some items throughout the quarter such as toilet paper, paper towels, cleaning supplies, et cetera, meats and proteins toward the end of the quarter, hand sanitizers and the like. Office and majors were also strong during the quarter driven by work from home initiatives while most other discretionary categories were a little weaker during the quarter such as jewelry, luggage, third-party gift cards, they were generally weak. Other weak categories which include things like sporting goods, lawn and garden, patio and apparel, while they were weak, they have rebounded somewhat towards the end of the quarter. From a supply chain perspective, I am going to give you 40,000 foot view of that. On the nonfood side, as it relates to imports from China, most the factories are now up and running. Other major country suppliers, India for textiles and domestics, Mexico primarily for things like TV assembly, a few weeks behind China in terms of getting back to normal but each week is showing improvement. On the food and sundry sides, paper goods still on allocation and item limits on certain items in certain regions. Sporadic limits on canned food items like tuna and chicken. The toughest areas, again, are still hand sanitizers, disinfecting wipes and Lysol sprays and the like. Items like milk and butter are generally okay. And also, we have eliminated like frozen, certain frozen proteins like chicken and beef items. In terms of fresh, on the protein side, the merchandise is there but challenging from a production and processing side. Currently, for us, pork is the least affected but somewhat affected by what we have done for the last couple of three weeks, I believe. On fresh beef, chicken and pork items, those protein items, we limit three fresh items in total. We also have limits of one per SKU on certain frozen items like 10 pounds of hamburger patties or chicken breast and the like. In terms of seafood and produce, that's all good. And again, talking to our buyers in these categories, they are generally, again probably with the exception of the hand sanitizer because it's not just people who are hoarding it, a great increase in use and demand of those items continued. But we expect continued improvement generally each week. And lastly, Costco travel, it was obviously significantly impacted during the quarter due to reduced demand as well as cancellations of previously booked trips. Members are now starting to actually book travel again, although generally further out than we have historically seen and of course we book those results when the trips or activities occur. Warehouses have overall remained open, although we did operate at reduced hours at most of our U.S. locations for several weeks during the quarter. Regular hours resume May 4 with an additional hour on weekday mornings for seniors and persons with disabilities. Warehouses are still following social distancing and sanitizing guidelines. Additionally, as discussed, some of our warehouse businesses like hearing aid, optical and photo and to a partial extent, the food courts, were closed or mitigated during the majority of the quarter. Also effective May 4, we now require all members and employees in the warehouses to wear masks. During the quarter, including again that big $283 million number, we spent about $32 million on masks, gloves and incremental cleaning supplies and things like plexiglass partitions, you name it, all related to COVID. But that's in that $283 million number. Some of the initiatives related to the $283 million in costs will extend into Q4. We would expect the incremental expenses related to COVID, these types of expenses related to COVID to exceed $100 million in Q4 but it would be quite a bit lower than the $283 million that we had in Q3. We will have to just wait and see, though. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending this Sunday, May 31 next Wednesday, June 3 after market close. With that, I will open it up for Q&A and turn it back to Joseph. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We have our first question from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Hi Richard. I know we have to wait till we get the May result but I don't know how much you can preview us just given how dynamic the environment is in terms of the mix of products that's being sold, traffic to warehouse because the environment, now you are starting to see other states and stores open. Curious if there is anything you can call out as a preview for May? Richard Galanti : I really can't call anything as a preview. Some of the comments I made in this document as it relates to towards the end of the quarter, we saw certain things pick up. The fact that we went back recently to full hours, we are all better both us, our employees and our members are better getting through the warehouse. So seasonally, I think some of the items that were online has picked up that we talked about. But we will wait and see next week. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And then my follow-up on memberships. I think you said that ex FX, they were up 6%, if I caught that. Can you parse out U.S. in the quarter relative to that 6%, if that is the right number? And then anything that surprised you with regard to the pace of new members growth, the actual amount or anything geographic? Richard Galanti : Generally, no. But what we talked about way back when -- at the end of Q2 and the beginning of this quarter, we saw some pickup when there was a lot of you know, when we had these crazy strong numbers and people were coming in to buy all those essentials, short supply, high-demand and short supply items. We saw some additional sign-ups but not meaningful relative to our whole company in those weeks, towards the end of February and the first half of March. Other than that, I think the fact that the traffic is down a little bit but the average ticket is up, you have got some members that are coming in and bulking up a little more. And then you have some members that are not coming in as often. So that hits you a little bit but overall we think that we are in pretty good stead. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Can I just sneak in one more? I just want to -- Richard Galanti : Yes. One other comment is that we have also seen a switch from walk-in sign-ups to online sign-ups. And that's good. When you sign-up online, I know you are also required to have auto bill which is a positive for renewal rates long term. Simeon Gutman : Yes. And then the last one is on e-commerce, the assortment, the SKU assortment. Any like strategic thinking that we should have a bigger assortment than you do? I think you are always adding but is there a rethink as far the total number of SKUs? Richard Galanti : I don't think necessarily. The only total increase is where we have gone to some additional suppliers in some very limited items. So we have expanded our supplier network in some limited cases. Beyond to that is more of a shift. It started with, if you will, some of the big and bulky items. And this started well before COVID, like white goods. And that's continuing and certainly the strength that we have had online, whether it's reported online through our two-day grocery or through e-commerce or certain third-party providers like Instacart and Shipt and others, all that stuff has driven some of the business from the warehouse to online. And again, I think, if I go back six, eight, 10 weeks ago, whatever the normal time to get something was, particularly like two-day grocery was well more than two days, we are back to two days. Same day, our third-party suppliers had challenges. They ramped up in the 200,000-plus new employees in a matter of weeks. That too has gotten a lot better in the last few weeks. So I hate to use the word strategic, we certainly know that big and bulky can be done very effectively online with a few displays in the warehouse as well but have that delivered and installed through online and that will continue. It probably has been expanded a little bit because of this people at home, things like exercise equipment and like big electronics and things. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks Richard. Operator : We have our next question from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good evening. So a couple of question on the margin front. Can you talk about, break down the ancillary margins a little bit in terms of what you saw in terms of the benefit of gas versus the headwinds that you would see from mixing down in those other categories? And as you look ahead, given where you see gas prices are at this point, would you expect that benefit of gas, if prices held, to be higher in the current quarter? Richard Galanti : Well, you know, there was a perfect good storm in the last quarter as it relates to margins and gas. And I think there's, not even our information, but there's public information on strength in retailers that sell gasoline in terms of gross margins. So we certainly benefited from that. A little offset to that was a reduced number of gallons. But nonetheless, it was particularly strong and I think that's evidenced in the matrix. You have higher margins on some of those other ancillary businesses like optical and hearing aid. While small in size, there's a higher margin because we have to account for the additional cost of optometrist and hearing aid technicians and the like. And so, those types of things, gas being the biggest piece of it towards the other stuff but it all ends up there was net net good for us in the quarter. Chris Horvers : And so was there any, did you have any impact in terms of like the apparel category? Did you have to take any markdowns? And as you look at ahead, how are you thinking about the potential risk of that category impacting? Are you seeing some rebound in that category and don't expect that to be a headwind in the next quarter? Richard Galanti : Fortunately, we haven't seen a lot of markdowns. Apparel, for us, is a pretty, there is a big part of it that's seasonal. And when this thing first started, we were able to talk to suppliers and work deals where in some cases certain things hadn't been made yet or they had the raw materials but they hadn't finished the product. So let's pay for part of the finished, for the raw materials but hold off until next season. We have held on. One of the reasons we went and borrowed money was looking at the worst case which, in our view, has not happened but what if we had a wholesome big volumes of seasonal stuff. We were going to, whatever commitments we had, we were going to respect. But I think, in combination of working with our vendors as well as sales have rebounded in those areas a little more than expected. It's not that people are coming in and going down every aisle. Some are just going getting their essentials and heading out of Dodge, but at the end of the day, I think as the weather has turned, we have been a little bit more, felt a little more good about things. Who knows what tomorrow brings, though. Chris Horvers : Okay. And then just the last question also on gross margins. You mentioned that e-commerce was actually a benefit. Most retailers we have seen have a substantial headwind as e-commerce growth accelerated. But it didn't seem to occur here because -- so could you elaborate on that? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, it's like I think everybody, for us, it's certainly a lower margin business as we tried to build it over time. It's really the gross margin dollars are stronger because of the huge sales volume. We are spending more money on it. And so probably, I don't have it in front of me, but as a percent of profit, as a percent of sales I am sure it is down a little bit and that's expected. But the total gross margin dollars are up, simply because of the sheer strength of it. Chris Horvers : Understood. Thank you. Operator : We have our next question from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good evening, Thank you for the opportunity for asking my question. Richard, are you reaching an upper bound of your membership potential in the U.S. with the view that if a pandemic is not going to motivate a regular consumer to sign up for a membership, that it maybe hard for them to sign up under any scenario? Richard Galanti : Well, we certainly don't believe that. There is going to be two or three new normals over the next two or three years and probably not a real new normal and then with its own set of difficulties besides that. We are asked the question constantly. When I talk about this giant 10-plus fold increase in same-day grocery delivery, that's certainly because people, there is a group of people that don't want to go out. There's others that want to come in but they coming less frequently and buy more each time. There's going to be some new normals. Our guess is that whatever it's gotten to is not going to necessarily, maybe there is a back down a little bit at some point, but still be higher than it was the day before all this? Sure. But who knows? That's something that we talk about every day around here. And I think over time, there's been a lot of questions and we are happy with our renewal rates and we are all going to have get past this. One of things that we and some others, what I will call the big essential retailers, we have all been fortunate that we been open. And when you talk to people, anecdotally they feel frankly more comfortable coming into a Costco which is bigger, more wide open certainly the six feet apart that we are all doing, with the mask requirements. There are a few people that don't like it but there's most people do. So I think all the things that we are doing including the visible things that you see in-store. And then look, at the end of the day, it's a value proposition. Our average gross margin is in the very, very low double digits, 11% or 12%, implying of whatever 13% or so percent markup. Traditional retail grocers are in the mid to high 20s and other big boxes are above that and regular retails way above that. So also it's got to be a combination of all those things. We have got to figure out ways to get you in and I think we felt so far at least successfully, sometimes begrudgingly but successfully figuring out how to get you stuff online as well. And it will be a combination but we will have to see over time. Michael Lasser : And my follow-up question is, speaking of online, given the success that you have enjoyed as of late, coupled with the acquisition you made a couple of months ago and the overall increase in online penetration that you have witnessed across retail in the last few months, is there an inclination within Costco to push harder to market your online channel more to expand your offerings to consumers? Or because of the desire to still push consumers into the store that you will maintain your posture? Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, I think by necessity, we have responded and maybe for those of you, sometimes, I not suggesting to you Michael, that feel that we have been a little stubborn or are not winded to some of this stuff, we still want you to come in. You are going to buy more stuff when you come in, period. And we think we can do both. I mean, we recognize and I think white goods was the best example way before COVID. Four years ago, in the U.S. we did $50 million in white good sales. Three years later, we did $600 million, on our way to $1 billion, which is getting there faster simply because of COVID right now. Certainly, the acquisition of Innovel helps a lot of higher ticket big and bulky items, many of which people don't want to put in the back of their suburban or truck and take home. So I think we will have to see over time. We feel we have also been pretty good, again COVID has changed things a little bit right now, doing marketing and having email promotions that are in warehouse. And again, time will tell over time and we will figure it out together. Michael Lasser : Understand. Thank you very much and good luck moving forward. I appreciate it. Operator : We have our next question from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. John Parke : Hi. Good afternoon Richard. It's actually John Parke, on for Chuck. Can you talk a little bit more about what you are seeing from a gas balance perspective towards the end of the quarter? A crossover to the business in the club? And then how some of those metrics have changed as certain areas have opened back up and are starting to normalize? Richard Galanti : Yes. Look, just driving to work, you know, there's less gas gallons being bought. I think it has picked up a little, just hearing from the news and things. I know in the state of Washington, they have each day as a percentage of cars traveling on different interstates is improving a little bit. Part of it is some of the stay at home stuff and part of it is the weather's gotten nicer and people want to get out of Dodge. It has to impact a little. One of our frequency catalysts or the frequency catalysts that we have always talked about are fresh foods, executive member and gas. And so to the extent that gas has come down a little bit, that hurts a little bit. Offsetting that has been the fact that, one, the average ticket in the store was way up which helps offset the lower traffic. And again, who knows what tomorrow brings. We are encouraged of how we got through so far. We have seen some things pick up a little bit in the last several weeks in terms of categories as weather turned. Certainly, some of the openings, I think, should help us. But again, we will let you know. Hello? Operator : Chuck Grom still on the line, sir? We have our next question from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is open. John Heinbockel : Hi. Richard, when you think about the Innovel, what's the biggest impact that's going to have from a customer perspective? And maybe it's just coincidence, it looks like, you look at some of the mailers, you have been pushing big and bulky a little more here. So that's not tied to Innovel ? That's just what you would have done anyway? Richard Galanti : I think it's kind of what we would have done anyway. It certainly is because we now have the confidence that we can provide a better service at frankly a lower total price. Innovel was one of our suppliers that has always done a good job, as have some others. And as we build more volume on it and get more density, that too will allow us to lower the cost and lower the cost to our members. Certainly, with that and what we have seen again, I think if you had asked us four months ago, hey, we are going to have this big COVID thing and this is what's going to happen, we certainly didn't know that we would sell more big and bulky items. What were finding is, is because people are at home, notwithstanding some of the economic things of layoffs and furloughs, people are buying things for the house. We saw that again more recently with not related to big and bulky but lawn and garden. If you would have asked us two months ago, how is lawn and garden going to look, we would say it's going to not be very good because of all the economic issues. So I think at the end of the day, we are marketing additionally right now because we have the confidence that we can, we have seen the delivery times on certain big and bulky items improved dramatically on small groups of items as we onboard some of those items. It's a year-plus process. John Heinbockel : And on the savings book, the thought process there, it looks like the assortment sort of getting back to normal, right, from a food and sundries standpoint. When is that fully back to normal? And do you go back to mailings or stay digital-only for now? Richard Galanti : We would go back to mailings in June. John Heinbockel : And the assortment normalizes in June as well? Richard Galanti : Yes. For the most part, yes. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We have our next question from Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open. Karen Short : Hi. Thanks very much. A couple of questions on, I guess, e-com in general. Wondering first, within the membership growth, is any color you could provide on growth in online sign-ups versus walk-ins? And then I wanted just to ask a little bit more about e-com generally. I mean you have kind of obviously, you are blessed and cursed with very high velocity units and you have had to do the distancing, which has impacted traffic. But would that kind of cause you to rethink potentially a much more robust click and collect model? And then I just had one other follow-up. Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, in terms of online sign-ups, a member that, again there are some members that aren't coming in or coming less frequently, to the extent they didn't come in the first part of this month and this is normally when they would come in and when they went to the checkout, it would notify them that they are up for renewal. They are now getting their email which they would have gotten, had they not renewed. And so that's pushing some of that way. Certainly, anecdotally, there have been plenty of people that have signed up to become members simply because of the one-day fresh or the two-day dry grocery. And so we are seeing a big push. I think it is too early to tell what happens in the future. I think more of it will go online just like everything else in life and we will do that. In terms of click and collect, we have very limited click and collect right now. It's in some of those high-value jewelry, small electronics. We did add pharmacy to it and that's not only click and collect, that's click and deliver through -- we are expanding. We are not everywhere yet with the benefit of Instacart. Tires, we are doing that where you could go online, order it and schedule it, schedule your tire installation. Photo. So we are doing more things. But if you are asking the question, to buy online and pickup in store in general, we are not looking at doing that on a regular product basis. We do delivery instead again through third parties in a big way as well as our own today. Karen Short : Okay. And then I mean I know it kind of seems like a lifetime from now, but when we look towards the fall, as it relates to merchandising like back-to-school, Halloween, I guess the question is, two, well two. How much flexibility do you have to pivot to the extent that there really isn't much of a Halloween or back-to-school? And then the second question is just bigger picture. Everybody loves to go to Costco for the samplings. So I am just curious how you are thinking about that going forward? Is that something that we will not likely ever see again? Is there anything that you are discussing in terms of how you could reintroduce that safely? Anything there? Richard Galanti : Karen, I missed the second part of the question. In terms of how do we feel our ability to pivot, look, if you go back two or three months ago, we were cutting orders, reducing orders recognizing there is going to be plenty of merchandise out there in these categories. Certainly for things like Christmas, I think we reduced the selection of a few things. And so a little more regular items than out there items. And now we are pivoting to try to get a few of those items, which are available. So frankly I think in some ways it's been easier for us because we have so many fewer SKUs and we are willing to try a few new things. And now, I didn't get the second part of your question. Karen Short : The other part of it was just people love going to Costco for samplings. Food sampling, that's a bit part of the experience. So how are you thinking about that, just bigger picture? When we get to a new kind of abnormal? Richard Galanti : We are going to start doing some things in mid-June on a slow rollout basis in sampling. I can't tell you anymore but it's needless to say, not going to be where you go and just pick up an open sample with your fingers. But the sampling and both food and nonfood items are popular. And road shows as well. I think you will see a little more excitement on the road show side. So things that we can do to get people excited about coming in. Karen Short : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : We have our next question from Greg Badishkanian from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Spencer Hanus : Good afternoon. This is actually Spencer Hanus, on for Greg. Just turning to e-commerce again. Can you give us any color on the repeat rates that you are seeing from the new customers that it looks like you are adding to the platform? And then have you been able to take advantage of some of the lower online advertising costs that are in the marketplace today? Richard Galanti : On the second question, the latter question, I don't know. I am not up to speed on that in terms of lower prices. I would assume, that's what I have read in the paper in general. So I would assume we have some of that ability, recognizing we don't spend a lot to start with. And the first question was what? Repeat business? Yes, you know what? That's another one that I don't know off the top of my head. Sorry. Spencer Hanus : Great. And then just if we could turn to small business customers. Can you talk about what you are seeing there? How did their sales go throughout the quarter for that segment of your customer base? Richard Galanti : Well, look, I mean food service related small business is down everywhere. It's been helped a little bit by some, we are less about serving the big restaurant chains but the mom-and-pop restaurants. And so that the takeouts in your neighborhood, the Japanese, the Chinese, the Thai, those types of things, they are doing some business. Arguably, what business we are losing on some of those things, we are gaining because you are eating at home. So overall, I think just in looking at fresh foods and the food items of what we call food and sundries, it's been way up, particularly in fresh foods and somewhat in the rest. So I think overall, we have been blessed. Now, the question beyond that is, what happens when everything opens up? I think it's going to be, the new normal is still going to take some time. You see on the news that even in states where it's been open, there's not everybody running to sit down. And then there's restrictions on how many people can be in a certain place at a given time. So again, having fresh foods has been certainly something that's been very positive for us. Spencer Hanus : Great. Thank you. Operator : We have our next question from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is open. Kelly Bania : Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Richard, I think you mentioned executive penetration, if I heard it correctly, was up 135,000, which seem to be just a little bit of slowdown. I am wondering if it was impacted by the environment? And if you have to do anything to change your process in terms of convincing members to upgrade there? Richard Galanti : Well, yes, it fluctuates all over the board. Certainly it shows improvement when we add a country like we have Japan and Korea in the last couple of years. It certainly is down from its peak a few years back. Probably the biggest things are that getting back to traffic, traffic is down a little bit. The other thing is, one of things we do in store a lot is something we internally call e-blocks or electronic blocks. So based on when your membership is scanned, based on your historical purchases, it makes all the sense in the world for you to upgrade to be an executive member. We have chosen for the last couple few months not to do e-block because it's one-on-one direct contact with the member while they are waiting in line at the register. And so we probably, my guess would be a little higher and then we haven't a lot of warehouses year-to-date. So we will get back to normal on these things. But it does not raise a concern for us at all on this point. Kelly Bania : Okay. And just as a follow-up, in terms of renewal rates, I think you mentioned any impact from COVID there will be in the next few months. Maybe just can you give us any color on what we should expect to see? I was thinking maybe there could be a positive impact to renewal rates from this environment? But any color you can share would be helpful. Richard Galanti : Well, we do what's called, we have always done it this way, a fully captured rate for renewal rate. So lets say you signed up originally in January. And so sometime in December, you get your renewal notice. And let's say, we ultimately get to that 90%, 91% renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada. By the end of January, you then draw the people that signed up in January, maybe by the end of January, I am making these numbers up here, at 75% and by the end of February you are at 82%, at the end of March you are at 85% and it takes, you might even get last 0.5% or 1% of that renewal rate six months out because if somebody that was a snowbird or somebody that just doesn't come in that often, there is always going to be that. In addition, whenever you have a group of new members, irrespective of whether it's online and in-store or in a new country, you have a lower renewal rate in that first respective year and then it builds each year over as year three becomes a combination of somebody renewing for the second time at a higher percentage than those that signed up originally in year two and were renewing for the first time in your three. So we don't know which direction. We know that we want to say that because we don't know where it's going to go. But the renewal rate right now is mostly related to stuff that happened four, five and six months ago and seven months ago. Kelly Bania : Thank you. Operator : We have our next question from Paul Lejuez from Citi. Your line is open. Paul Lejuez : Hi. Thanks. Richard, can you remind us of the economics of an online order in terms of basket size and what's in that basket? Then separately, curious if there are any categories within the box that you would say you are a bit high from an in-store perspective? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, from online, there is regular online which includes rather big ticket items. So I don't have the number in front of me but if in-store during regular times the average frontend transaction was in the $160 range, $140 range, I am sorry $140 range, online which include a lot of big ticket items was probably $300 to $400 range. As we have added two-day grocery, that number has come down. Certainly, while we don't again include in e-com the same day grocery that the likes of Instacart and others come in and do, that's going to be lower as well. So all these things are in flux right now. Paul Lejuez : Got you. Then on the inventory side? Richard Galanti : Again, I am happy to report that it is less than we braced for the worst case a few months ago or a couple months ago when we decided to raise some extra capital. Might we have to take things like seasonal apparel and seasonal lawn and garden and luggage, we do have some luggage to sell you, but it's a small category. But at the end of the day, all those things are less than we thought. So yes, there will be a small amount of items, probably in the few hundred to several hundred million dollars that will hold for a season or up to a year. But these are not things that are going out of style, even in items like apparel, which again I think we did, our buyers did a very good job of mitigating that impact initially with the suppliers. And also it's come back a little better than we thought. Not all the way back by any stretch but better than we thought. And in addition, we are not exactly high-fashion where things are going out of style. A lot of things that we have, whether it's some furniture items or apparel -- our senior merchant in the room is not pleased with that comment. But we are basic, we are fashion basic. We are not [indiscernible] about that. Paul Lejuez : Got you. And then just Richard, what percent of members shop the club in 3Q versus last year? And did this quarter mark a peak in that metric? Richard Galanti : You know, I never looked at it. I mean it's a good question. We will have that for next time. Certainly, it's a lower percentage this quarter simply because of new members or people that cited, I mean I have friends that have chosen not to go physically anywhere and they are having things delivered and they love the same day fresh. So my guess, it's come down a little. Why don't we have two more questions? Paul Lejuez : Thanks. Good luck. Operator : We have our next question from Greg Melich from Evercore. Your line is open. Greg Melich : Hi. Thank you. So Richard, it seems sound like e-commerce was probably 8% of the business in the quarter and if I am interpreting it correctly, should we think of it as that that would have grown to over 10% if you include the Instacart as part of e-commerce? Richard Galanti : Yes. Greg Melich : Okay. And then second is on inflation. You talked about obviously deflation in gas and what that did to the topline. Has there been any inflation, especially given some of the shortages and proteins, et cetera that's worth noting as an offset? Richard Galanti : Overall, ex gas, overall it's very small. I am actually guessing because it's a lot more sales volume than there is inventory level. But on certain limited items, we have seen extreme examples were like eggs for a period of time. Some of the protein items like meat. But I would guess that it's impacting us a little less than others in some of those categories because of some of our supply relationships and strength but it depends and it's coming back now, it's coming down. So overall, I would say very little difference than it would have been. Greg Melich : Got it. And then on Innovel, just a follow-up on that. How much of Innovel's business was distributing other people's things? And where does that revenue show up? And how you are thinking about either growing or reallocating that capacity? Richard Galanti : Well, keep in mind, Innovel is a business built over decades to serve Sears, it's owner. And Sears of course has come down dramatically over the last few years. And while I can't disclose all the numbers I am aware of, the component that was actually still servicing their needs had come down. And then also they had gone through their own reorganization as a retail company. And with that, I think they lost the business along the way. So you know, there is an infrastructure and a capacity in place, infrastructure in place with great capacity. And so we view this as an ability to do great things with. Greg Melich : Could you describe that capacity a little bit? Like just number of employees or footage? Richard Galanti : I think employees were 1,500. There is I think 11 large facilities, call it the roughly 800,000 to 1.2 million square foot facilities. And then about 105 smaller facilities which could be as small as 8,000 or 10,000 feet or as big as 50,000 or 60,000. And spread out generally serving I think 85% or 90% of the U.S. And again there's a lot of ability, it has a lot of capacity. And we were doing, we worked with them for five-plus years, I believe. But like anyone else working with them, we are doing a small piece of our business because we didn't know what was happening to the business as it's parent was going through it's on restructuring. Greg Melich : Got it. Thanks. Well, good luck. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Last question. Operator : We have our last question from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Erica Eiler : Good afternoon. This is actually Erica Eiler, on for Rupesh. Thanks for fitting us in and to hearing our question. So I wanted to touch on the store capacity restrictions that you put in place. You talked a little bit about the impact from some of the ancillary businesses being closed had on your sales. Are you able to quantify for us what you think the impact may have been to sales from the store capacity limitations and restrictions that you put in place? And as things start to open back up in certain markets, are there any changes in these restrictions you put in place? And can we expect to see these restrictions weigh up on sales for a bit longer? Richard Galanti : Well, the only thing I would pointed out earlier was, those businesses like optical, hearing aid, a reduced food court, those things was somewhere in the middle between one and two percentage points impact in Q3. Aside from that, when we went from generally closing Monday through Friday and 8 :30, we went to I think 6 :00. But we also added an hour in the morning for elderly and expanded that from two days to three days now to all five weekdays. We have not tried to quantify that. I can tell you that when we have had some very busy locations historically and we said let's add an hour in the morning or an hour later at night, what we found is, we tended to just spread the business. So I think the same thing here. There is not a lot of big impact other than our qualitative view was that there's a lot more impact from shelter in place and stay at home and come and get what you need and leave than there is from anything else. And again as that, I was encouraged by some of the things I have seen with a couple of the other retail apparel stores that have just started to open and are showing good numbers, because people are coming back. So I think that net net is encouraging. But I don't think it was a big impact to us either way. By the way, yes, there was and you noticed in our numbers, Canada was weaker than the U.S. In Canada and Quebec there's actually current and outstanding limitations of Sunday closes which is new over the last few months. And there is also I think been a little bit more stricter generally over up there, either stricter or people listening better to stay at home issues. And so we have seen, in a country where we are the only game in town in terms of warehouse clubs, we have seen weaker traffic and therefore slightly weaker numbers than the U.S. Erica Eiler : Okay. Well, I guess that's a good segue into my next question. So I was just curious on international side. If there is any more color you can provide on what you are seeing internationally with regards to Coronavirus impacting? Are there any notable differences in terms of behavior or any other callouts versus the U.S.? Richard Galanti : Well, again, putting on my blinders for a minute. Taiwan and China are the most encouraging. China, we have one location, of course, that's been open for less than a year. So we don't have a year-over-year comparison. Taiwan is quite strong. Japan is quite strong, maybe a few weeks behind that. We see Australia coming back. So overall, that gives us encouraging news for the U.S. and Canada. But part of that answer is, so what until we see it. Erica Eiler : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Richard Galanti : Okay. Well, thank you everyone. And me and my guys here are around to answer questions. Have a good day.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference over to Richard Galanti. Please go ahead. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Laurie, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020, the 16 and 52 weeks ended August 30. Reported net income for the fourth quarter came in at $1.389 billion or $3.13 per diluted share as compared to $1.097 billion or $2.47 a share - per diluted share last year in the fourth quarter. This year\u2019s fourth quarter was negatively impacted by incremental expense related to COVID-19 premium wages and sanitation costs, totaling $281 million pretax or $0.47 a share, as well as a $36 million pre-tax charge or $0.06 per share related to early payment of $1.5 billion of debt.  These items were partially offset by an $84 million pre-tax benefit or $0.15 a share for the partial reversal of reserve of $123 million pretax, $0.22 per diluted share related to our product tax assessment taken in the fourth quarter of last year. Net sales for the quarter increased 12.5% to $52.28 billion, up from $46.45 billion in the fourth quarter a year earlier. For the fiscal year in its entirety, fiscal 2020 came in at $163.22 billion, a 9.3% increase over the $149.35 billion in fiscal 2019.  Comparable sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 were as follows : On a reported basis for the 16 weeks the U.S. was 11%, excluding gas deflation and FX the U.S. was 13.6%. Canada reported 9.1% up, again ex-gas deflation FX 12.6% up. Other international reported 16.1%, ex-gas deflation in FX, 18.8%, bringing the total company to a reported number of 11.4% comp and again ex-gas deflation and FX up 14.1%. For the company, e-commerce reported was 90.6% up, and ex-gas and FX \u2013FX, 91.3% up.  In terms of the fourth quarter comp sales metrics, foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by about 50 basis points, and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 220 basis points. Traffic or shopping frequency on a worldwide basis was down 1.2% during the fourth quarter and showed an increase of 1.2% in the U.S. Our average transaction or average basket size was up 12.7% during the fourth quarter, notwithstanding the negative impacts from gas deflation and FX which were included in that number.  We\u2019ve kept you up-to-date in our monthly sales calls on the impacts from the pandemic as we've been able to identify those. Overall merchandise sales in the core, core being food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh, as well as pharmacy have all been strong, while sales in our ancillary, other ancillary, and travel businesses though now open have been soft.  Next, moving down the income statement, membership fee income. We reported a fourth quarter membership fee income of $1.106 billion, up $56 million from $1.05 billion in the fourth quarter of \u201919. The $56 million increase ex-FX would have been $60 million up.  During the quarter we opened eight net new units and 13 for the entire fiscal year. In terms of renewal rates, at fourth quarter end our U.S. and Canada renewal rate remained at 91.0% and worldwide rate also remained at its similar number from a quarter ago at 88.4%. In terms of the number of members at Q4 end, both member households and card holders, total paid households at fourth quarter end was up \u2013 came in at 58.1 million and card holders 105.5 million.  In the fourth quarter, we standardized the membership count methodology globally, which we had apparently done differently in different markets, North America versus others, and so that increase includes that slight adjustment. The change resulted in adding approximately 1.3 million paid members and 2.0 million card holders to our member base.  So as an example, from Q3 to Q4 when we showed going from 55.8 million to 58.1 million or up 2.3 million, that 2.3 million increase includes the 1.3 million adjustment upwards. Similarly, the $3.7 million increase from the end of third quarter to fourth quarter, that 3.7 million increase includes 2.0 million of an adjustment. I'd like to note however that neither the membership fee income dollars nor the renewal rate calculations were affected by this adjustment. At fourth quarter end, paid executive memberships totaled 22.6 million, an increase of 765,000 during the 16 weeks since third quarter end.  Going down the gross margin line -- going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin came in at 11.24%, up 18 basis points from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 11.06%. That 18 basis point increase, excluding gas deflation came in \u2013 would have been minus 4 basis points and excluding a portion of the direct COVID expenses would have been up 8 and I\u2019ll show you that in the numbers that I ask you to jot down here.  If you jot down the following numbers, two columns : First column will be fourth quarter as reported, second column will be fourth quarter ex-gas deflation. The first line item would be core merchandise. Year-over-year on a reported basis, core merchandise was up 101 basis points, ex-gas deflation up 82 basis points, so plus 101 and plus 82 in the first line item.  Ancillary businesses being the second line item reported minus 66 basis points and without gas deflation minus 71. A 2% reward, minus-4 basis points and minus-2 basis points, other minus-13 basis points and minus-13 basis points and that would give you totals on a reported basis of plus-18 basis points which I mentioned and ex-gas deflation of minus-4 basis points. Now the core merchandise component of gross margin again was higher by 101 basis points year-over-year and 82 basis points higher ex-gas deflation, similar to last quarter and even more dramatic of an impact during this quarter, we had a significant sales shift from ancillary and other businesses to the core. This resulted in a higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core operations versus last year.  Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to only their own sales, so core-on-core if you will, margins year-over-year were up by 70 basis points. Fresh foods was the biggest driver up here with a strong sales in fresh we benefited from efficiency gains in both labor productivity and significantly lower what we call D-and-D or damage and destroyed or product spoilage. Food and sundries, softlines, hardlines as well as fresh - as a mentor fresh foods already, but in addition food and sundries, softlines and hardlines all had higher margins year-over-year in the quarter as well.  Ancillary and other businesses gross margin again was lower by 66 basis points and 71 basis points ex-gas deflation. Most of our ancillary businesses were lower year-over-year with a most significant negative impact coming from gasoline and travel, which accounted for about three quarters of the decline.  Costco logistics, which was primarily our acquisition this past March of The big-and-bulky last-mile carrier called Innovel.\u201d That was our newly acquired businesses. That impacted ancillary margins by minus-8 basis points. Again, we acquired this, this past March and we anticipated losses in this business as it ramps up. Note that these losses are not taking into account any added sales or expanded product offerings, lower delivered prices and improve member satisfaction. Next, 2% reward, nothing really to say there, minus-2 basis points ex-gas deflation. In other, the minus-13 basis points, nearly all of this is attributable to the costs from COVID, $64 million of the $281 million previously mentioned. These are direct costs for incremental wages and sanitation allocated to our cost departments and to our merchandize fulfillment operations, so it impacts cost of sales.  Moving to SG&A. our reported SG&A percentage year-over-year was lower or better by 47 basis points coming in at 9.62% of sales this year in the fourth quarter versus 10.09% last year in the fourth quarter. Ex-gas deflation SG&A was lower or better by 66 basis points. Again, if we jot down the following two columns of numbers, first column is reported year-over-year SG&A change, and the second column would be ex-gas deflation.  Core operations as reported were better or lower by 42 basis points and ex-gas deflation lower or better by 57 basis points, so plus-42 and plus-57. Central plus-1 and plus-3; stock compensation plus-3 and plus-4, other plus-1 and plus-2 and that gives you the total on a reported basis SG&A being better by 47 basis points and ex-gas inflation being better by 66.  SG&A in the core excluding COVID related expenses which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment was significantly leveraged of course with a strong core of merchandise sales increases. As I mentioned, central, stock compensation showing small improvements year-over-year as a percent of sales and now the other plus-1 and plus-1 basis point and reported in a plus-2 ex-gas deflation. As I discussed earlier in the call the quarter was positively impacted by an $84 million reversal of last year's fourth quarter, a $123 million pre-tax reserve related to a product tax assessment taking a year ago in the fourth quarter.  The net impact from this item was plus-43 basis points. That plus-43 basis points is in this plus-1 and plus-2 basis point number. Also included in other are the incremental COVID costs or $217 million of the $281 million total amount. That equates to 42 basis or 41 basis points without gas deflation offsetting it the other way, so that's why you have that very small number in that line. Again, these are the costs for incremental wages and safety and sanitation.  Next on the income statement, pre-opening expense. That pre-opening expense last year in the fourth quarter was $41 million, this year in the fourth quarter was $15 million less coming in at $26 million. Last year in the fourth quarter we had 12 gross openings, 10 net and two relos, and that compares to 10 openings gross or 8 net in the fourth quarter this year. The big difference in those two numbers, this year's fourth quarter relates primarily to warehouses opened during the quarter, as well as warehouses scheduled to open in the first quarter. Last year's pre-opening included $12 million in pre-opening expenses related to our new \u2013 our then new poultry complex.  All total reported operating income in Q4 increased 32%, coming in at $1.929 billion this year compared to $1.463 billion last year and it would be a slightly higher percent increase if you excluded the items that I had mentioned earlier.  Below the operating income line, interest expense was higher year-over-year by $6 million coming in at $51 million this year compared to $45 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $83 million year-over-year. As discussed earlier, following the completion of the debt offering we pre-paid $1.5 billion of debt during the quarter. There was a pretext expense of \u2013 or what's known as a make-all payment of $36 million related to the early retirement of that debt, that's in this interest income and other line.  Actual interest income was lower by $28 million. It was actually lower by $28 million year-over-year in the quarter due principally to lower interest rates being realized. And lastly FX and other was lower by $19 million. Overall reported pre-tax income in the fourth quarter was up. It came in higher by 25%, coming in at $1.869 billion this year compared to $1.492 billion last year. Again, these exclude those items I point \u2013 that's including those items I pointed out earlier. In terms of the income tax rate, our tax rate in Q4 of \u201820 was 24.9%, a little lower than a year ago when it was at 25.7% in the fourth quarter a year ago, so a little benefit there.  A few other items \u2013 a few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, with COVID we had some delays in some of the planned openings for the fiscal year that just ended this past August 30 and a few of those have been pushed into this year, that we are in now. For the year we opened 16 total units including three relos. So last year we opened a net increase of 13 locations. Our plans for this year is to open about 20 net, 23 including the 3 relos, that's our best guess and plan at this point, and as of Q4 end our total warehouse square footage stood at 116 million square feet.  In terms of capital expenditures, for the 16 week fourth quarter we spent approximately $852 million and the full year we spent $2.8 billion. Our estimated CapEx for all of fiscal \u201921 is in the $3 billion to $3.2 billion range.  E-commerce: overall our e-commerce sales as you\u2019ve seen each month have increased nicely. For the fourth quarter on a reported basis up 90.6% and ex-FX 91.3% increase during the fourth quarter. A few of the stronger deployments and there's several, health and beauty aids, food and sundries, appliances, TV's, computers and tablets, housewares and small electrics.  Total online grocery grew at a very strong rate in Q4, several 100%. This e-commerce comp if you will, the e-commerce numbers I just mentioned above follow our usual convention which we exclude the third party same day grocery program. If we included that third party same day our e-commerce comps result would have been approximately 120% up during the quarter.  Overall our e-com sites were relatively smoothly during the quarter despite the dramatic volume increases and we were able to improve our delivery times throughout - delivery times throughout the quarter as we adjusted to the ramped-up order volumes.  Now, quickly turning to COVID and the coronavirus and some of the issues and impacts surrounding it. From a sales perspective as indicated by our past three monthly sales releases, we've enjoyed strong sales results during the June, July and August time frame. Certainly these \u2013 the sale strength starts with our being deemed essential, resulting in strong sales of fresh foods and foods and sundries and health and beauty aids and the like. We've also benefited from the much improved sales and products and items for the home, outside of the food area.  As people are spending less on travel, air and hotel and dining out, they seem to have redirected some of those dollars to categories like lawn and garden, furniture and mattresses, exercise equipment, bicycles, housewares, cookware, plastics [ph] and the like. And lastly, a few of our ancillary businesses, notably our optical and hearing aid operations were closed for 12 to 16 weeks and reopened during the mid-summer.  From a supply chain perspective, kind of 40,000 foot view, in terms of China, at least judging by the shipments to us, most of the factories are up and running. There are still some production challenges due to certain components downstream in the supply chain, in areas like electronics, computer and certain white goods. It is getting better and improving each week, and like us so we feel that our suppliers\u2019 factories have gotten better over the last several months of instituting safety protocols, that's our best guess. India in terms of getting back to normal, each week is showing improvement and catching up, still a little behind. Food and sundries, some limits on paper goods are getting better. Toughest area overall is still sanitizing wipes, as well as latex gloves. In terms of other PP&E, we are in pretty good shape selling quite a bit of masks and the like. Milk and butter, things like that are generally okay.  In terms of fresh foods, proteins are currently all pretty good. There had been some slowdowns over the past few months and some allocations and some limits that we had to put on some of the sales in those items, but that's gotten back to normal at this point. Seafood and produce, all good as it has generally been throughout. In terms of holiday merchandise planning; Halloween, a few \u2013 a small reduction in the amount of costumes. Some more basic candy items, as well as for Christmas going a little more basic in some areas and as well as looking at things, the needs and uses for the house. But viewing and given our strength of late, relatively optimistically.  And Costco Travel has shown some very modest improvement, but still significantly impacted during the quarter due to reduce demand. We do see our remember starting to book travel again, although generally further out than we have historically seen. Our warehouses overall have remained open and are back to regular hours with additional hour on certain weekday mornings and many markets for seniors and persons with disabilities. The warehouses are still of course following the social distancing and sanitization guidelines and since May 4 as you know we've required all members and employees in the warehouse to wear masks.  Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results which is for the five weeks ending Sunday, October 4, on that following Wednesday, October 7th after market close.  With that, I will open it up to Q&A and give it back to Laurie. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Hi everyone. Hey Richard, my first question is how should we think about or how you are planning COVID costs for Q1 of the next fiscal year? And if I'm not mistaken, I thought that for this fourth quarter there was a range \u2013 I don't know if there was a range, but we were expecting them to be lower sequentially and I think they were pretty similar. So you mentioned the basics what it constituted, but can you talk about why? Richard Galanti : Sure, as you may recall, on our first quarter conference call we indicated that such types of costs in the Q4 would be at least $100 million or over $100 million and of course $281 million is over $100 million, but quite a bit larger. But the reality is, the biggest factor is we chose to continue at least for the time being the $2 an hour premium. That represents about $14 million a week.  To-date, we are doing that and we've committed to doing that at least through, I believe the first eight weeks of fiscal \u2013 of this fiscal quarter, and again, we'll take that time and again. Our numbers have been very good, our employees are on the frontline, and so that \u2013 mind you, the fourth quarter was a 16-week quarter versus Q3, which is a 12-week quarter. So on a per week basis, it\u2019s come down. There\u2019s other things that have been, that won\u2019t be repeated in the first quarter at least. If you go back to the very beginning of time, for the first four to five weeks when we stopped doing food samples, we employed those third party employees ourselves. We paid our third party to have them help us in the warehouse, that was during those three to four weeks of craziness in late February through mid to late March when people were coming in and hoarding and what have you and that helped quite a bit.  So there's some costs that I don't expect to be continued. The biggest component of course would be the $2 premium and we'll see. At this juncture, we\u2019ve committed to our employees for the first 8 weeks of this quarter. Simeon Gutman : Okay, thanks for that. My follow-up, as you mentioned the holiday and I think you said, you're looking at it optimistically or favorable for now. Can you talk about, maybe a little more detail why? It seems like the results speak for themselves for now, but there could be a lot of change over the next couple of months, and has your customer diversified their basket with you know and you know you think you'll be able to retain them across more categories and keep trips as more retail gets their traffic back? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Sure. Well look, I mean the main data points that we look at is how strong things have been in the last 3.5 months, 4 months. You know June, July and August sales results which we've all shared with you guys. The trend in traffic has improved, so it's been positive the last couple of months instead of slightly or even more than slightly negative, going back to April and May, while the average ticket or average basket sizes continue to be relatively strong, so \u2013 and then probably if you ask what are some of the biggest surprises that we've had looking at the last three months of sales results compared to what we had expected a few months before that. I mean the big surprise is we expected you know fresh and food and sundries and paper goods and the like and health and beauty aids to be strong, particularly food because of the weakness, you know people dining out. But I think we're a little surprised by the strength in many of these discretionary, non-food categories, things for the house and big-ticket items.  Again, not only furniture for that inside the house, but patio furniture; live goods were particularly strong. Where in some instances we had tried to cut back a few orders back in March and April for seasonal summer goods like patio furniture. Very quickly we were having to scramble for more of those.  And so, so far so good. We recognized that people who are coming into Costco, we believe they feel safe given the safety protocols and the mask requirements. The sheer size of the building itself and the width of the aisles, so all of those things have helped us in that regard.  We are also back to after a couple months of not having our traditional multi-vendor mailer, you know coupon type of offerings, because several key items were limited or on allocation. We\u2019ve gotten back to that, and so I think our \u2013 at least our most recent three-plus-month history has given us some comfort at this point. Now as soon as I say that, things may change, but you know at this juncture we feel very good about how it\u2019ll be \u2013 what it looks like going forward. Recognizing, looking at some of these things with the more basic in terms of Halloween and Christmas and the like. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good evening guys. So my first question is, you know what's driving that strong core-on-core margin outside of the fresh category, which you know clearly would benefit from a shrink perspective. Is it sell-through and low clearance? Is it mix within the categories or is it something else? Richard Galanti : Well, on fresh, it\u2019s all the above. I mean its strong sales on a relatively higher initial margin business within our small confines of margin range. But then you know two components across the sales and fresh is labor productivity and spoilage. We don't have spoilage, we sell out, not literally but almost literally to the piece on these and things, and so you're not throwing stuff away, there is \u2013 it\u2019s a great business from a gross margin dollar perspective given the sales strength in it. So that\u2019s clearly the biggest thing.  But again, if you look at the other three core areas, core-on-core, food and sundries, hardlines and softlines, they're all up. But up you know a nice amount but nothing like fresh foods, so that\u2019s helped.  Now mind you, other things have offset that and the sum of all those things is still a positive. The things that have offset it would be things like the fact that certain ancillary businesses which are higher margin businesses were closed for 12 to 16 week period. Our food court of course has been limited of what we do there. We took out all the tables, we\u2019ve limited the product offerings. Travel which is, you know while a small business is an extreme an example of high margin, many items in travel is just a brokerage fee, almost sales minus no-cost of sales equal gross margin if you will, is the markup or the commission on some of that stuff, a portion of that. So you know those things have calmed down, but the sum of all those negatives are outweighed by the overall strength and core merchandise sales and pharmacy, pharmacy\u2019s been relatively strong too. Within that, fresh has been the biggest driver of it. Chris Horvers : Got it. So a final question on that. You were surprised by the negative gas impact and ancillary. I mean you're peers, while not the same quarter saw tailwinds for the periods that crossed over, and so can you talk about how much of that 66 basis points is specifically gas versus the other businesses and as you look forward, you know considering that opticals open and food courts at least with a smaller menu open and starting to see some traction around travel and gas prices being stable. Do you expect that at this point that ancillary headwind could abate? Richard Galanti : I think it will be less negative, but I think it\u2019s going to be around for a while. I mean if you look at gas, gas is more profitable per dollar, per gallon of sales than it was a couple of years ago. Because I think the prices have come down, traditional retailer has not been as competitive, which allows us to be more competitive, but still make a little more.  At our trough, at the lowest point, I'm guessing back in April and May, there was a week where our gallons were down close to half. Today they're down closer to maybe down 10%, you know maybe 5% to 15% depending on the day of the week. But you know in normal times for the last few years pre-COVID, when the U.S. gasoline industry had comps in the very low single digits, we'd be in the very, very high single digits or close to 10% or 11% even sometimes.  So things have changed there. It\u2019s still a profitable business, but when your price per gallon goes down 20%, 30% and your and gallons are down even some small amount, and it\u2019s a 10% plus percent of sales of our business, it has that effect on it. At the end of the day, the sum of all this has still been quite good for us. Chris Horvers : And could you break out that 66, that\u2019s specifically related to gas? Richard Galanti : No, when we said three quarters of it, it was gas and travel, that\u2019s as good as we get here. I don\u2019t have the detail in front of me. My guess is gas is more of it than travel, but they're both impactful. Chris Horvers : Your guess is better than mine. Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question is from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett; your line is open. Chuck Grom : Hey, good afternoon. I\u2019m curious Richard, how you are thinking about the recovery of your gasoline business, particularly from a gallons perspective. And then I guess how this interplay is holding back the traffic into your stores. It\u2019s clearly getting better, but you know being impacted a little bit by the gas business. Richard Galanti : Well, I don't know exactly. I haven't seen numbers in the last week or two, but I believe our call it 10% negative gallon comp is still way better than the U.S. as a whole \u2013 the U.S. gasoline industry as a whole. And so, but you know we\u2019d rather have plus-10 to minus-10.  The fact is that people are coming in less, but they are buying more each time and the sum of those two things as we've shown here, we used to enjoy a 5% to 8% comps pre-COVID on a regular basis and the last three months we've enjoyed 14% if you will. And so overall we'll take that, but it\u2019s got to be a small impact still. Chuck Grom : Okay and then just, it\u2019s been a while since I asked it, but the crossover between our customers that purchase gas and then and shop in the store at unlike times, hours. Do you have the number handy? Richard Galanti : I haven't seen it lately, but historically it has been for - during the hours that the warehouse itself was opened, the gas station is opened a couple hours perhaps on the other side of that, it\u2019s in the low 50s. Chuck Grom : Low 50s, okay great. And then just switching gears a little bit, on capital allocation, you ended the year with over $30 per share in cash and cash equivalents and you obviously remain significantly under lever. Curious how you and the border are approaching this high class problem? Richard Galanti : Well, we have our regular quarterly board meeting in a couple of weeks, we'll see. But at the end of day, we talk about it every board meeting, all the different alternatives. Certainly we \u2013 when we went out to borrow the $4 billion, which was really a net increase of $2.5 billion because we used $1.5 billion to pay off existing debt. The fact was, it\u2019s that we're planning for a worst case scenario where we would be more \u2013 there'd be a seasonal summer merchandise that we might have to hold for a year, as well as there\u2019d be a lower inventory turn particularly on discretionary non-food categories.  Up until June when we\u2019ve seen the numbers really go in the northern way, you know June, July and August, much of that need has not occurred. So yes, we are in a good position right now, we\u2019ll continue to look at it, but you'll know this after we know. Chuck Grom : Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question is from Karen Short of Barclays. Your line is open. Karen Short : Hi, thanks very much. I guess first question was just on the $2 premium. I guess the real question is, I mean I know you called out the eight weeks, but would it be more prudent as we kind of model this to just kind of think that that's more or less the new norm, meaning $14 million a week is kind of what we should add on, on an ongoing basis. It just seems that, it's hard to take something like that away once you've offered it. But just thought on that? Richard Galanti : I don't think it\u2019s completely hard to take away. We communicate via our COO and our Head of HR to our employees. We've done that and we've continued to extended, but saying this will be it, and then we\u2019ve added a little more. Well, I think we\u2019ll see. I think something will \u2013 I think its may be hard but not impossible and we want to make sure we communicate to our employees of why we're doing it and we'll just have to wait and see Karen. Karen Short : Okay, and then I wanted to just\u2026 Richard Galanti : I certainly budgeted it in for the full fiscal year, but we don't know at this point. Karen Short : Okay, and then\u2026 Richard Galanti : We know at least eight of the 12 weeks in Q2 and maybe more. Karen Short : Okay, and then just back to traffic for a second. So within your reported traffic numbers, is obviously e-com rate. So I wanted to just ask a little about what your physical in-store traffic looks like and then I think on the last call you were asked on color on traffic with you're more loyal executive members versus you know the lower level members. Do you have any \u2013 do you have any color on both of those? Richard Galanti : I'm, looking real quick. I really, I don't I don't have color in terms of. Generally, and the executive members do everything, spend more, come in more frequently, buy more each time and renew at a higher rate.  I\u2019m looking real quick here, hold on. I don't have traffic. Comps \u2013 within our comp number, e-commerce benefits it by a little over 3% of the comp, yeah and not the traffic number. Karen Short : Okay. A - Richard Galanti : And the average ring has more than doubled. I\u2019m sorry, the average rate on e-com versus the warehouse is about twice and that\u2019s because you got a lot, and still even though we\u2019ve expanded on food and sundries and apparel, you still got big ticket items like electronics and furniture, exercise equipment and the like. Bob here is saying, he's guessing that the traffic impact would be one to two, but we don't how that's broken out. Operator : And your next question is from Michael Lasser form UBS. Your line is open. Michael Lasser : Thanks a lot for taking my question. So Richard now that we\u2019re six months into the pandemic, does cost still come out of this situation in a better position to experience incremental margin expansion over time, and is there any factor that you\u2019ve learnt that will allow the company to generate more margin expansion that would otherwise. Richard Galanti : Well, the more margin we can generate, the more likely we're going to give some of that back. In this case arguably given our strength, we've certainly given it back, but we\u2019ve remained very competitive, but we\u2019ve also maintained that $2 premium to our employees, which we appreciate. The first part of your question, when you started asking about, how do we feel we're going to come out of the pandemic and as thing change; I mean look there's factors as people eat out more and go out more or travel more, there's less for the home, you know that's on a macro basis.  We have to believe here and we do believe that we have picked up new members, we've picked up sales from existing members, from categories that they are buying more at Costco now relatively speaking in-part, because certain other venues or traditional venues are either closed or not frequented as often. So again, we\u2019ve been blessed in that regard.  I think the other thing that I\u2019ve witnessed over the last several months is our merchants ability to pivot and to add items for the \u2013 houseware items, additional items and so I think net of all those things, I still think on a macro basis when people start eating out more and start flying more and attending \u2013 you know going on vacations, some of these monies are now being used for purchasing things for the home is going to move that way.  That being said, I think there\u2019s several areas where we\u2019re retaining more of their dollars and some portion of that will continue to retain when it gets back to normal. Michael Lasser : Okay, and an on an unrelated note, when you look at commerce growth, what percentage of your membership is currently buying from you online, with the profile of the member who is driving the growth? And presumably a lot of the spend is incremental, because the spend of those members is going up. So does that change how you are thinking about emphasizing or investing behind your e-commerce business? Richard Galanti : Yeah, I don't have all those specifics. What I know is, what was happening even before COVID and has been exacerbated in a positive way since COVID is more some members have signed up to utilize those services. More members are utilizing those services and spending more on it.  If you think about the one day fresh, it is up several 100% fold recognizing it was a smaller base, even as its gone down from its peak couple three months ago, it's still a lot higher than it was before, and my guess is even as people get used to wanting to go out, there are some people right now that aren\u2019t going to the supermarket or aren\u2019t going out to shop, or to Costco to shop, they love the service. There are some people that are going \u2013 there\u2019s going to be some group that is going to like that, and given our quality and value you know we and the supermarket are not mutually exclusive of one another and we think we'll keep some of that. So we are certainly doing more to market to members not only in store promotions, but online promotions as well.  Yeah, we feel \u2013 I feel better about our offerings today certainly than a year ago or two years ago, recognizing there\u2019s a lot of low hanging fruit because of some of the things we had done historically.  We know that on the \u2013 I hate to use the phase again, but on the big-and-bulky side, a lot of those things \u2013 you know for four years we had talked, which is pre-COVID, we had talked about going from $50 million in white goods sales in store in the U.S. with a limited sales penetration if you will, to fiscal \u201819 doing almost $700 million, I think just under $700 million. That business has increased at a more rapid pace in the last year for two reasons, COVID and many people buying things for the home, as well as in our view the rigid old things we are seeing trends wise in terms of how to utilize, better utilize our big-and-bulky Innovel acquisition what we call now, what we now call Costco Logistics for big-ticket furniture items, lawn and garden items, exercise equipment and a like. Michael Lasser : Okay, thank you very much and good luck. Richard Galanti : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Paul Lejuez of Citi; your line is open. Paul Lejuez : Hey guys, Paul Lejuez. Richard, can you maybe talk about what you're seeing in terms of spending by new customers relative to existing customers, but also relative to what you would typically see from a new customer. And then second, I guess I'm curious if you looked at club usage by members at all? You know what percent of your members used the club this quarter versus last quarter anyway to frame that? Thanks. Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t know if I can answer all those specifically, but keep in mind, some of our new members signed up simply for same day fresh or two day dry. Same day fresh, you have to be within a market trade area where there's a Costco. Two day dry, you can be anywhere, I think almost anywhere in the United States and with Instacart it\u2019s both United States and a good part of Canada now. And so we have some members, if they weren\u2019t a member, but they are signing up just to get two day dry and they're not near a Costco, need to say they\u2019re just buying those types of basic dry grocery items and that's it.  Generally speaking, what we\u2019ve seen in any given number, whatever type of member, they buy more each year over the first few years of their membership, and then there's the age thing as well. The sweet spot for us is still 40 to 55 year olds as they've grown economically, grown family wise and are not on the downside of that curve in terms of empty nesting and what have you, but I don't have any specifics beyond that to give you. Paul Lejuez : How about club usage? A - Richard Galanti : Club usage, same thing. Again, I can tell you, I don't have anything specific, like you know the last few months, but club other than traffic has improved greatly from its trough five months ago, not back to where it was you know pre-COVID. But one of the things that we see is is that the typical member over the first three to five years is growing their total purchases, which is a combination of their basket and their frequency. And clearly when we can convert somebody to an executive member, they are buying more and shopping more frequently than that. Paul Lejuez : Got it, thank you. Good luck! Operator : Your next question is from Oliver Chen of Cowen; your line is open. Oliver Chen : Hi, think you. Richard, on the e-commerce frontier it's been really impressive what you've done. What is some of the lower hanging fruit that you see had there, and also if you could brief us on the penetration now and how you might see that step change and where that will head in the future? Richard Galanti : Well, I mean the main lower penetration things are if you go back three or four years ago, I don't think we had good email addresses for much more than a third of our member base, we didn't focus on that kind of stuff. Today we have well over 60% and growing.  We now require you when you sign up \u2013 and more members are signing up online, than in store in general anyway. When you sign-up, you sign-up with an email address. So we\u2019re doing a lot more to collect and gather those email addresses and then communicating with them more often, so that's probably the single biggest low hanging fruit. The other thing is we feel that we've been able to use you know emails if you will not only to drive e-commerce special promotions, but also in-store special promotions, as well the COVID, you know we were pleasantly surprised by just a sheer increase and people using same day fresh. You know anecdotally I can\u2019t tell you how many people have mentioned to me how they love it and that means they may very well be shopping same day fresh or same day whatever from their local supermarket as well. But we've got a lot of great items on there and it's hitting a cord. Oliver Chen : And Richard, as we look to this holiday season, which is definitely like no other, what factors would you prioritize as how you're planning it as best you can differently this year versus others, and is the multi-vendor mailer in good shape and are you going to leverage that a lot for holiday as well. Would love your thoughts around dynamics of supply chain and marketing for holiday. A - Richard Galanti : Well, the multi-vendor mailer is back and you know there may be a few items that we don't have because of certain supply limitations, but for the most part it\u2019s completely back after I think two or three of those or six or nine weeks of multi-vendor mailers if you will that we didn't do. I think the biggest difference is again for the Christmas holidays, is getting back to the basics, but you're still going to see some hot, exciting items at Costco.  The \u2013 again as I mentioned, even on Halloween we still have costumes. I think we brought in something like 80% of what we would have normally brought in, 80% or 90% and we're actually selling them. So we added some vendors over the last several months given certain shortages.  You know one of the challenge is right now, we've had great numbers in electronics and white goods, not restating the fact that the numbers would be better if there was greater supply. We all read about their service supply issues on laptops and computers and things like that, on some of the gaming things on some of the white goods you know where there might be downstream shortage or at least some allocation of compressors. So we're doing very well on that. We've added some different vendors in some cases and I think the fact that we did so well this summer relative to what we had anticipated has given us the confidence to be still pretty aggressive going into the fall. Oliver Chen : Our last question, on same day fresh and the momentum there, what are the margins like and what are your thoughts about that margin and the take rate and also taking some of those capabilities in-house versus using the white label? A - Richard Galanti : Well, at this juncture we have a very good relationship, who with other competitors I'm sure having a good relationship also with Instacart. There\u2019s a few other smaller ones that we're using. We're not necessarily looking to take that in-house at this juncture, but we are always looking at various third parties and we have good existing relationships and we want to keep growing those as well. Oliver Chen : Thank you. Best regards. A - Richard Galanti : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners; your line is open. John Heinbockel : Hey Richard, so there are a couple of things in gross. Even if you take out fresh food right, it looks like the other three were up quite a bit. Maybe you know dive into a little bit similarities driving those three of the categories versus what might be unique to each and then how sustainable is that right, because this is probably for the better core-on-cores we've seen in a while. Richard Galanti : Sure. Well look, first and foremost there's a \u2013 well, I guess two things. There's a little bit less promotional activity going on. If you think about TV's and electronics, those have been such a strong category, not just for Costco, but in general. The manufacturers haven't been doing as many promotional things. So \u2013 and the other thing is is, given just this year\u2019s sales strength, you know when you're comping \u2013 you know if we comp to the, whatever it was in August 14, I don\u2019t have it in front of me or whatever, but in some of these categories that we\u2019re talking about where we're stronger, you're talking you know comps in the low to high 20\u2019s. When you got those, that kind of sales strength, you have very little \u2013 on a much smaller scale you have less markdowns.  So you got a \u2013 whatever your regular margin is on those categories, less, a little bit less. You know without a little bit of an offset from end of cycle or \u2013 and some of those cycles are 60 and 90 days by the away on some of those skews, so that\u2019s helped here a little bit. John Heinbockel : And then on ancillary right, you said 75% was gas and travel. Was gas the bulk of that and if so, and is gas more of the compare last year versus any decision you made right to take less margin. I imagine it's not that to take less margin and try to drive traffic. This market\u2019s just not there, right. A - Richard Galanti : You know, I think in terms of less margin, that's more of our DNA. You know when things are really good we're going to drive sales even further and do that or when things are good we're going to you know \u2013 we feel a little more comfortable doing that $2 an hour for another month, whatever it might be. But at the end of the day there's probably less price competition out there today than there was a year ago and so we\u2019re able to maintain our fair margins. John Heinbockel : Alright, and then lastly, what's the current thought process on two things : expanded both as, well what you happen to want to do for cost reasons and a third tier of membership. I don\u2019t know if it would be a higher tier or a middle tier, but you know sort of segmenting that a little more. A - Richard Galanti : Yeah, well on Buy Online and Pickup In Store, we continue to look at what others do, we continue to scratch our head a little bit. It's not that we\u2019ll never do it, but it's not on the agenda for this week. And as it relates to an additional tier of membership, again I don't think that's on the top of the priority play at this juncture given everything else that\u2019s going on. John Heinbockel : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Scott Mushkin of R5 Capital; your line is open. Scott Mushkin : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. So I guess I want to get back Richard to the e-commerce, the traffic mix and you know comments that you\u2019ve made prior about really wanting to get people into the club. As the pandemic shifts that, where you\u2019re going to see permanently traffic being an issue there, you know how are we supposed to \u2013 how are you thinking about like impulse purchases and just a classical model once we exit the pandemic if this kind of sticks with omnichannel just being a much bigger piece of the pie overall? Richard Galanti : Well, you know first of all keep in mind, if our online business was 5%-ish a year ago and now it's 8%-ish, that's a big delta in one year and it'll continue \u2013 it will probably continue to increase as a percentage from there, and that excludes the third party Instacart type business, yeah the one day grocery.  So you know look, we've been pretty good at pivoting along the way, and we recognize there's lots of attributes to value. The first and foremost is the lowest price on the greatest quality or quantity of goods and services and the trust that we've endeared with our members. I think that we'll figure that out as we go along. We're not \u2013 we maybe occasionally stubborn on something, but we're not completely intransient if we see we need to do something. We figure out how to do things in a little different way than others and we\u2019ll continue to do that. Scott Mushkin : And as far as the pickup, I think you were quoted in a recent article on this. I mean how are you thinking about pickup over time and you know is there a way to bring that to \u2013 you know bring that arrow into what you guys are doing without \u2013 at better economics. I know you\u2019ve always been cautious about those economics. A - Richard Galanti : Well, keep in mind, when third parties do it, their cost for picking, we believe we don't know exactly what they are, but we believe based on our wages and benefits is less and they've created a model that works with their density and everything else. They are not just buying and delivering from Costco; they're buying and delivering to others, so there's some economics in that model that makes sense.  Our view also is there\u2019s some retailers that are doing it because they feel they have to. You know one of things, the article that you're talking about is the article today. The one in my view, the thing I would disagree in the article is we should be concerned because our sales have started slowing, which is the contrary. They're stronger than they've ever been in the last three months. So you know we don't have our head in the sand on it. We look at it. We have people here that study it and maybe we'll surprise you one day, but at this juncture we're not prepared to do that. Scott Mushkin : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer; your line is open. Rupesh Parikh : Good evening! Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just two related questions on real estate. So as you look at your store growth for this year, what\u2019s the split between international and domestic? And also just given some of the challenges of brick and mortar, I'm also just curious if you're starting to see more opportunities on the real-estate front? A - Richard Galanti : Yeah, I mean I think our general view is that we still feel that \u2013 we want to open looking at this year into next five years, open somewhere between 20 and 25 a year net new units. About half of those, a little more than half will start by coming in the United States and that'll trend over the five years to maybe being slightly over 50/50 in the U.S. to slightly under 50/50 in the U.S. We still think we have plenty of opportunities in the U.S.  It does take longer in certain other countries. I think we're just about ready to do a second unit in France. We just opened our third unit in Spain after having opened our first unit in Spain, Gosh! Five years ago. We have one unit in China with two planned for fiscal \u201922; we're now in fiscal \u201921, and so some of these countries do take longer, but we are also putting a little bit more emphasis on that, where we've been successful or where we think we can be successful and \u2013 but I think you know again, at the 40,000 foot level, if we did 20 to 25, a little more than half in the first couple years is U.S. and by year four, five or six It\u2019ll probably be you know a set of 60/40 or 55/45 U.S. and will turn to be just the opposite. Rupesh Parikh : Great! Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital; your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Thank you. Hi guys! Actually another store growth question. What is the limiting factor for you in terms of accelerating your store grow further? Like you\u2019ve got you know a grand total of one in France and grand total of one in Spain right, and you've been there for five years. Like it just seems to me like there could be a lot more store expansion if you really wanted to push it and I guess what I'm wondering is, you know what keeps you from accelerating that further? A - Richard Galanti : I think there are a couple of things. First of all, I've always said that we're a very hands-on company and one of the things we\u2019ve learned when we've gone a little too fast, not to suggest one in five years is too fast, it is not, but you know I remember in Japan we got to 10 or 12 locations and then in about an 18 month period we opened eight or nine and we had a little bit of operating indigestion. As it relates to France, it took us close to 10 years to get our first open. The level of people and entities that can appeal that process and fight you to keep you out is unbelievable, and again, in Spain we actually have three, the fourth this year.  Generally speaking, if I were to look at various countries, we\u2019d open five in the first five years and that would be relatively fast for us, and \u2013 but again it gets back to I think getting that hands-on and make sure that we feel comfortable, how that market is doing. We're probably a little slower than we could be, but we feel good about it. It\u2019s worked for us, then we\u2019ll I think continue to do that. Scot Ciccarelli : So Richard, that\u2019s on the international front and that makes sense. You got to get comfortable with the market and supply chain of course, but what about just in the U.S. Like you're obviously comfortable with all the, you know how to navigate kind of store openings and you know what are the kind of restrictions you might have. You know it just seems to me like if you've got a decent amount of white space. A - Richard Galanti : Fair enough. Well, I think some of the white space gets better each year. If I look at even the Seattle market, you know there was a multi-year period where we didn't open any additional units and then we opened on the east side here at Redmond and a couple of others, and part of it is cannibalizing nearby units. But no, we try to be relatively methodical and disciplined of kind of the returns that a new unit can generate, net of cannibalization, and could we open 20 instead of 12 or 13 in the U.S.? Absolutely. But it's how fast the real-estate people or the regional operations people get with our CEO to go through that process and finding the right properties, yeah. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay, thanks a lot guys. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Baker of D.A. Davidson; your line is open. Mike Baker : Hi! Thanks guys and it\u2019s getting late, so I'll be quick. But I wanted to ask you about the membership fee income up about five and change I think this quarter, which has been pretty consistent throughout the year. But I guess how much of that you think is from new members that you're picking up because of the pandemic. Some of your competitors are seeing you know big increases in new members from the pandemic. It's hard to tease that out from your numbers. I mean if you compare this \u2013 we can compare it to past MFI numbers, but it's a little lumpy because of the fee increases. So any idea of what you're picking up in terms of new members because of the pandemic? Richard Galanti : We don't disclose that. It\u2019s still a smaller percentage of the total, it\u2019s not a majority of the total. Mike Baker : And does it surprise you that those membership numbers aren't accelerating more as you might see from some of your competitors? A - Richard Galanti : You know, our view when we look at some of our competitors numbers is partly because they have a much lower number of members per location than we do, and that's our view. But the fact is when we look at how penetrated we are in so many of our markets, I mean we are even in California where we have 120, 130 units, I forget how many units we got there. I believe we're north of 60, slightly north of 60% member household market share, in states like Oregon and Washington where we\u2019re well in excess of that. So I think that's part of the issue in our view. We've got a lot of people already. Mike Baker : Right yeah, yeah, makes sense. Alright if I could ask one follow-up on gas gallons sold, you said you were at 10% today, that\u2019s not at 10% for the quarter, down 10% that is, I believe right at that sort of point in time. Did you mention how your gas gallons sold were for the \u2013 as we go through the whole quarter. Richard Galanti : We did not, that is definitely a more recent number in the last month let\u2019s say. I mentioned it may have been even in the end of Q3, which ended like May 10 or May whatever around them, where we were like a minus-50. But my guess is we are somewhere in the low to mid-teens for the last month. Mike Baker : For the last quarter or for the last month. Richard Galanti : The last month, low teens. Mike Baker : Okay, and so the total quarter is somewhere between those numbers presumably. Richard Galanti : Yes, yes. Mike Baker : Got it! Great, got it, understood. Thank you. Operator : Yeah your next question is from Peter Benedict of Baird. Your lines open. Peter Benedict : Yeah, hey Richard. Just a question on how the product shortages issues that you guys have seen around COVID might be influencing your view on where you might go next in terms of vertical sourcing. I mean I don't assume there's anything electronics or white goods, but has the experience of the last four or five months, maybe set the curve in terms of when certain initiatives might be pulled forward? Richard Galanti : Well, yeah in terms of vertical initiatives, we've got \u2013 you know the last two or three years have been quite a bit, not only a bakery commissary that serves U.S. and Canada, just across the Canadian border, not only a second meat plant in Illinois versus the one we've had for many years in California, not only the poultry complex, and not only a couple of smaller produce initiatives we've got going on right now. And last but not even expected, but the acquisition of Innovel or what we now call Costco Logistics. So we\u2019ve got our hands full with a lot of things right now. I don\u2019t necessarily see \u2013 I think one of the things that we\u2019ve learnt from COVID, we have great relationships with large companies, both consumer product name companies and private label name companies doing literally multi hundreds of millions of dollars of one item.  When there's been some shortage of supply, we've had to expand that vendor network a little bit. There is some instances where given our sheer volume in Asia now can we find a comparable manufacture or existing supplier that wants to do something over there. So I think there's be some ways to continue to reduce costs on key items, but in terms of what's the next big vertical, I don't know if we know at this point. Peter Benedict : Okay, no that\u2019s fair and just lastly on the travel bookings you had mentioned. You were starting to see a pick up there, but it's further out the normal. Can you frame maybe what's normal and what you're kind of seeing now? I thought that was interesting. Richard Galanti : This is my definition of what I understood previously at normal, is if you go back pre-COVID you know the majority of your booking is each day related to stuff for the next few months, may be a little further out for you know five months before Christmas or five months before the beginning of summer. Today you've got people booking things out five and nine months in some cases. Now there's two reasons; one there is some great deals out there and two, in many instances there's no cancellation charges. And so we'll have to wait and see and part of that will be dictated by \u2013 you know we\u2019ve actually sold and have had some members go one some cruise of late, still a very small number.  The car rental business has picked up a little bit better than the other, but still down relative to what it had been pre-COVID. Peter Benedict : Great! Thanks so much. Richard Galanti : Overall \u2013 and mind you, if we book something out nine months, we don't take it into revenue until the trip is taken. So even though business has improved, in terms of what we show in our numbers, there's very little \u2013 it's just starting to \u2013 first of all it\u2019s not negative right now. You know there were a few months there in April, May, June or April, May certainly where cancellation costs were greater than trips being taken. Peter Benedict : Alright, makes sense. Alright, thanks Richard. Operator : Your next question is from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital. Your line is open. Kelly Bania : Hi Richard, thanks for taking our question. Just wanted to ask maybe a two part question here. More and more retailers are talking a little bit about advertising, maybe as a way to offset their lower margin e-commerce business and so I was curious; one, if you could talk about where are e-com margins just with all the acceleration and maybe just also remind us what bucket that is in your table. But then also just philosophically how do you think about that, maybe taking on any more ad-revenue to your dot.com business? Thank you. Richard Galanti : Well, we're taking on more ad revenue and we keep learning more about that as well as we drive that business. But overall the margins \u2013 as lower gross margins, part of that is category specific, you know electronics which is by far the largest single component of e-commerce is a high single digit margin. If you think about it, in the Costco warehouse you've got fresh that\u2019s in the low double digits, you know sometimes a pre-teen or early-teen and you've got again conversely electronics, which is you know it mid to high.  You also, as we try to drive the business in certain new categories like apparel, where you know buy two items and get $5 off of whatever the marketing or promotional item is, there is a low realized margin on a given category and some of those categories versus in store.  So overall you also have less SG&A and I\u2019d get back to what Costco is always been at top line company. We are looking to grow the top line. Certainly the profitability of e-commerce has improved dramatically in the last year with these strong sales, but its part of the ecosystem.  Where is it in the matrix? It\u2019s an ancillary. Kelly Bania : It is an ancillary, okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Laura Champine of Loop Capital; your line is open. Laura Champine : Just a quick one, Richard. You\u2019ve managed to improve inventory turns or grow inventory slower than sales since the onset of COVID. I know that some of this has been supply chain issues or issues with certain skew sourcing, but that seems to be clearing up. How long can you keep improving inventory turns at this pace? Richard Galanti : Well, if we keep doing 14% sales for a while, but I\u2019d say that tongue-in-cheek, because if you go back to April and May, the inventory turns had come down and one of the reasons we are planning for additional capital, working capital needs. Look, I think we\u2019ve gotten to a point when we\u2019ve enjoyed a turn based on how you calculated in the 12% to 13% range. When you get up to that range, it\u2019s difficult to some extent as well. Gas helps it, because we turn the gas every day; fresh foods helps it, because we turn fresh foods every week or less. I think about every week, maybe a little better than that. And the fact that we didn\u2019t have a big denigration on non-food items, which we had thought would be an offset to that, so it\u2019s helped it a little bit right now. But if you ask me if I could just keep where we are right now, I\u2019d say sure. Laura Champine : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Christopher Mandeville of Jefferies. Your line is open. Blake Anderson : Hi, this is Blake on for Chris. Thanks for squeezing us in here. I was wondering if you comment at all on the extent to \u2013 you know how much of your existing customers you had before the pandemic that historically didn\u2019t buy general merchandise, that are now shopping that category. How much of that example have you seen? Richard Galanti : Yeah, I don\u2019t know of the top of my head that, sorry. Blake Anderson : Okay. And then just lastly, can you talk about renewal rates and your expectations on those? Should we expect them to maybe creep higher given all the comp strengths you\u2019re seeing now? Richard Galanti : Yeah, sorry, you\u2019re 0 for two. No, we don\u2019t guide. There are things that help the comp, that help the renewal rate, getting people to executive, getting people to do our credit card. Some of the things we do now when you sign-up online, auto bill, and so those are things that help push it upward a little bit.  Yeah, the fact to the extent, but conversely, if we ramped up internationally and not that we are going to do that overnight, but if we ramped up internationally, you start in any new market, the first few warehouses in a new country, you work on a much lower renewal rate to start with, but a much higher number of initial sign-ups, because there\u2019s lot of lookie-loo\u2019s. And so all those things weigh in, we feel so far that you know \u2013 I know as soon as we show a minus tenth of a percent in a quarter, which is knock on wood, we haven\u2019t of late, people worry what\u2019s going on. But our view is that we\u2019re hanging onto our members, we\u2019re getting them to \u2013 where in most countries, even in new countries we\u2019ve seen the trend to more often improve than not and so I think we feel pretty good about that. Blake Anderson : Got it! Thanks so much. Richard Galanti : Why don\u2019t we take two more questions. Operator : Yes. Your next question is from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI; your line is open. Greg Melich : Alright. Richard, just one clarification and one question. Did you say e-commerce was 8% and then over 10% including Instacart? Was that for the year or the quarter? Richard Galanti : Quarter and roughly. Greg Melich : 8%-ish and 10%-ish, got it. And then\u2026 Richard Galanti : Yes-ish. Greg Melich : So on traffic, I guess that was my follow-up. You talked a lot about and it\u2019s nice to see the U.S. traffic come back through the quarter. Could you help us understand why international traffic remains negative and if there is any outlier countries driving that or is really the U.S. the outlier with traffic come back, and if you\u2019re concerned that that could influence the renewal rates in those international markets? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Well no, Canada is the outlier internationally. Mind you, if U.S. is a little over 70% of our company\u2019s sales, Canada is around 10%, 15%, I\u2019m sorry 15%. And so you\u2019ve got other international being less than... Yeah, there have been more restrictions in Canada. Australia also there have been more lockdowns of late, but in Canada and we have no direct warehouse competition in Canada. We\u2019ve seen their traffic more negative with a basket even bigger than the U.S. So we are still kind of buying and we\u2019ve seen that improve also. It\u2019s that negative has been reduced, so hopefully that will continue as well. Greg Melich : Got it. Richard Galanti : Trend-wise, the last four months have been on the up and up. Greg Melich : Got it. So the trends are in the right direction, it\u2019s just taking longer for those country-specific reasons? Richard Galanti : It went further down to start with too. I mean I think even I\u2019m shooting from the hip here, but even several months ago if the U.S. was a minus-five traffic, Canada was a minus double-digit traffic. Greg Melich : Got it! Great, thanks a lot. Good luck. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : And we have Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please ask your question. Your line is open. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks for having me on the call. I wanted to know if you\u2019re noticing any regional differences in terms of how consumers are behaving during the pandemic? Infection rates are rising in certain states and there is threat more. I don\u2019t know if they will fully go to lockdowns or not. But do you see any differences in terms of how they\u2019re getting ready for Halloween or worried about trigger treating or anything like that and how are you responding to that? Richard Galanti : I can\u2019t be specific, tell you specifically about Halloween. The only \u2013 if I look back over the last several months, the only thing that we saw was is when certain states unlocked more quickly, we saw a little pickup there faster, earlier, because people were getting out, getting out faster. Some of those states that did that. Other than that, we haven\u2019t seen anything dramatic. [Inaudible]  I mean Bob makes a good point here. I think and we are all guilty of it is, the pandemic has progressed, we are all hopefully. Richard Galanti : Hello? Robert Moskow : Yeah, we can hear you. Richard Galanti : You can hear me now. I thought I hung up on you, sorry. I think as the pandemic has continued, people have gotten a little more comfortable, hopefully still maintaining the safety protocols, but going out more often and that\u2019s helped us, the numbers pick up a little bit as well. And overall, again anecdotally we feel that people feel more comfortable coming into a place where masks are required, where the places, the physical spaces are larger with more cubic feet of open-air if you will. So I think those things have probably helped us. But the only real difference we saw was during those couple of months where some states opened up a little faster than others. Robert Moskow : Okay. Does that mean, net-net, past re-openings eventually improved, that\u2019s a net positive for your business in 2021? Richard Galanti : Well, it\u2019s a net positive, but we don\u2019t know, does that also mean that if people eat out more frequently, they\u2019re going to buy less food, fresh food or food items at supermarkets and Costco. There\u2019s probably some different offsets there.  Again, we believe that some of the things that we\u2019ve picked up through this pandemic, in part because a lot of these non-food discretionary categories and big ticket categories, some of that\u2019s going to be sticky. And once they\u2019ve shopped and had a good experience at Costco at a great value, they\u2019ll hopefully continue that. Robert Moskow : Okay, thanks so much. A - Richard Galanti : Okay. Well, thank you everyone. Have a good day and we\u2019re around. Have a good day! Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Richard Galanti. Please go ahead. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Cindy, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal \u2013 our fiscal year 2021, the 12 weeks ended November 22. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.166 billion or $2.62 per share, compared to $844 million or $1.90 per diluted share last year. This year\u2019s first quarter included tax benefits of $145 million or $0.33 per share, $0.16 of which was due to the deductibility of the $10 per share special cash dividend to the extent received by the company\u2019s received by the Company\u2019s 401(k) plan participants; and $0.17 related to stock-based compensation. Last year\u2019s first quarter included a $77 million or $0.17 per share tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, as well. And this year\u2019s results also included the cost related to our COVID-19 premium wages of $212 million pre-tax or $0.35 per diluted share. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.9% to $42.35 billion, up from $36.24 billion last year in Q1. In terms of our first quarter comp sales metrics, on a reported basis, for the U.S., we reported a 14.6% figure, excluding gas deflation and FX impacts, the 14.6% for the 12 weeks would have been 17.0% increase. Canada, for the 12 weeks reported 16.2% ex gas and FX 16.8%. Other international reported 18.7%, ex gas and FX 17.7%. So all sold for the total company we reported 15.4% comp sales increase and excluding gas deflation and FX, the 15.4% would be 17.1%. Ecommerce, on a reported basis for the 12 weeks was 86.4%, and excluding FX, 86.2%. In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 5.5% worldwide and plus 7.6% in the U.S. Our average transaction size was up for the company 9.4% in the quarter year-over-year and up 6.5% in the U.S. These include the negative impacts from gas deflation and the positive impact from FX. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by about 30 basis points and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 200 basis points. Going down the income statement, membership fee income came in at $860.9 million, up $57 million or 7.1%. Ex FX, it would have been up $54 million or 6.7%. During the quarter, we opened eight new units. In terms of renewal rates, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate as of the end of Q1 2021 was 90.9%, that compares to a quarter ago of 91.0% and worldwide, it was 88.4%, which was the same as it was a quarter ago. Now the U.S. and Canada rate of 90.9%, compared to the 91.0% this 0.1% decline was primarily the result of what we believe to be deferred renewals in Canada due to the pandemic. For example, traffic or frequency in our Canada warehouses in Q1 came in at a minus 1.3%, compared to a plus 7.6% figure in the United States. By the way, the U.S. renewal rate was the same at both quarters end. In terms of number of members at Q1 end, total paid households at Q1 end was 59.1 million, up from 12 weeks earlier Q4 end of 58.1 million and total cardholders at Q1 end was 107.1 million, compared to 12 weeks earlier at 105.5 million. Also at first quarter end, paid executive memberships totaled 23.3 million, an increase of 642,000 during the fiscal first quarter. On to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the first quarter was higher year-over-year by 50 basis points coming in at 11.55% of sales, compared to 11.05% a year ago. Excluding gas deflation, the 50 basis point increase would be 30 basis points. If you jot down two columns of numbers here to shed light on the components of gross margin, on a reported basis in Q1, 2021, the core merchandize margin year-over-year was up on a reported basis 83 basis points, plus 83. Second column, without gas deflation it would have been plus 66 basis points. Ancillary businesses, minus 15 basis points reported and minus 20, ex gas deflation. 2% reward minus 6 basis points and minus 4. Other, minus 12 and minus 12 and if you add up the two columns, on a reported basis again gross margin as reported as a percent of sales year-over-year in the quarter was up 50 basis points on a reported basis and ex gas deflation, up 30 basis points. Now the core merchandize component gross margin sales was higher 83, up 66 ex gas deflation. Similar to the last quarter, we had a sales shift from ancillary to core. This resulted in a higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core operations versus last year. Looking at core merchandize categories in relation only to their own sales quarter-on-quarter if you will, margins year-over-year in the quarter were higher by 65 basis points. Fresh foods was again the biggest driver here with strong sales in the fresh we benefited from efficiency gains and labor productivity and significantly lower product spoilage. Food and sundries, soft lines and hard lines, the other three main core components all had higher margins year-over-year in the quarter as well. But fresh foods was the driver. Ancillary and other businesses gross margins as shown here was lower on a reported basis by 15 basis points and minus 20 ex gas deflation. Most of the impact coming from travel and to a lesser extent from gas, optical hearing aids and food courts. Costco logistics, which is our name for the acquisition of Innovel that we did several months ago impacted ancillary margins by minus six basis points, a slight relative improvement from the prior quarter year-over-year. 2% reward. Nothing surprising there. And the other in the minus 12 basis points, all of this was attributable to the costs of the COVID-19 of $53 million of the $212 million total amount previously mentioned. These are the direct costs for incremental wages allocated to our manufacturing, production and fulfillment operations. All told, even with the $53 million of COVID costs hitting the margin, Q4 year-over-year gross margin on a reported basis ex gas still up 30 basis points year-over-year. Moving to SG&A, our reported SG&A in the first quarter as a percent of sales was lower or better year-over-year by 15 basis points coming in at a 10.15% of sales, compared to a year earlier to first quarter of 10.30% and ex gas deflation, the 15 basis improvement would be 32 basis points of improvement. Again jotting down two columns of the numbers reported and without gas deflation, core operations in Q1 on a reported basis was lower or better by 49 basis points, so a plus 49, ex gas deflation of plus 62. Central, plus 1 and plus 3 basis points. Stock compensation, plus 3 and plus 4 basis points. Other, minus 38 and minus 37 basis points and summing those two columns up, total reported SG&A year-over-year was better or lower \u2013 better or plus 15 basis points and ex gas deflation, plus 32 basis points. Now, SG&A into the core, again, it shows ex deflation improvement of 62 basis points. This excludes the COVID cost which I\u2019ll talk about in a minute. There was significant \u2013 the basic significant leverage was strong core merchandize sales increases. In terms of others, the minus 38 or minus 37 basis point number ex deflation \u2013 gas deflation. These are incremental costs from the COVID-19 or $159 million of the $212 million total number that we had mentioned earlier. The premium wages have been extended through January 3rd at this time. Again, even including these $159 million of COVID-related premium pay expenses, SG&A year-over-year improved nicely. Next on the income statement is preopening expense, $22 million this year in the first quarter, compared to $14 million a year earlier. We had ten openings, eight net of two relocations during the quarter and four openings gross, three net of one relocation a year earlier. Last year\u2019s $14 million number did included a couple million dollars related to preopening on our new poultry \u2013 on our poultry complex, which was opened and went into business right before the beginning of Q1. All told, reported operating income for Q1 2021 increased 35%, coming in at $1.43 billion this year compared to $1.061 billion last year and even a higher percent increase of course, it would have been higher now we had those - the premium pay. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $39 million this year versus $38 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $6 million year-over-year. Interest income itself within interest income and other was lower by $22 million year-over-year, due in large part to lower interest rates, offset by FX and other which was up \u2013 was higher or better by $16 million year-over-year. So, overall, reported pretax income in Q1 2021 was up 34% coming in at $1.42 billion this year, compared to $1.058 billion a year earlier. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 16.8%, compared to 19.1% in Q1 last year. Both year\u2019s tax rates benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation as mentioned earlier. This year\u2019s tax rate in the first quarter also benefited from the tax deductibility of the special dividend payable to Company\u2019s 401(k) participants as discussed, that portion payable to the 401(k) plan participants as discussed earlier in the call. This year\u2019s full \u2013 this full year\u2019s - fiscal year\u2019s effective tax rate, excluding these discrete items is currently projected to be between 26% and 26.5%. In terms of warehouse expansion, as I mentioned in the first quarter of this fiscal year, we opened eight net new units. Our plan for the year is somewhere in the 20% to 22% range. None in the second quarter and 5 or 6 in Q3 and 7 or 8 in Q4. As of Q1 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 117 million square feet. In terms of capital expenditures, in the first quarter of 2021, we spent approximately $893 million. Our full year CapEx spend for fiscal 2021 is still estimated to be in the $3 billion to $3.2 billion range. In terms of ecommerce, overall, our ecommerce sales in Q1 ex FX increased at 86.2% year-over-year. A few of the stronger departments, food and sundries, housewares, pharmacy, OTC and health and beauty aids, small electrics and TVs and other electronics. Total online grocery grew at a very strong rate in Q1, nearly 300%. This comp numbers that I mentioned the 86.2% figure follow our usual convention which excludes these third-party same day grocery program as they come in themselves and shop in our warehouses and then delivered to our members. If we include the third-party same day in our e-commerce comps, the 86.2% result would have been just over 100% . Innovel, now rebranded as Costco Logistics continues to grow and we continue to push more big and bulky items to the site. We\u2019ve added - in the past quarter, we added an Instacart scheduler this quarter where members can select specific delivery dates for most big and bulky items and made improvements to our call center with specifically trained agents, as well. That continues to grow nicely. And lastly, a couple of fun sports items just loaded two days ago. We have a Babe Ruth Autographed Baseball for $64,000 and a Ty Cobb Autographed Louisville Slugger Bat for $160,000. We\u2019ve also recently sold a number of memberships for Wheels Up, a private jet service operator. Now turning to COVID and some of the issues and impacts surrounding it. From a sales perspective, similar to our strong sales results this past summer in our fiscal fourth quarter, we have continued to enjoy strong sales results during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We continue to generate strong sales in food and sundries and health and beauty aids and fresh foods and alike, and we\u2019ve also benefited from improved sales and products and items for the home as people are spending less on air and travel and hotel and dining, now they seem to have redirected some of those dollars to categories like electronics, furniture and mattresses, exercise equipment, housewares, cookware, domestics, et cetera. And as mentioned earlier, sales in most of our ancillary businesses were slower year-over-year in the quarter, travel, gas, hearing aids and food courts. From a supply chain perspective, 40,000 foot view if you will. Most factories are up and running at our suppliers and in many cases, production capacity has been increased. However, even higher increases in demand of some products are still creating some supply issues. There are instances of 50%, 100% or even more sales increases of an item and if we can procure more, we\u2019ve had even higher sales. Examples would include things like, exercise equipments, certain major appliances, certain electronics items, as well as certain housewares and small electric items. On the transportation front, there have been some container shortages at origin, as well as some congestion at destination ports here in the states. The latter typically two to four days, but a little longer in some cases. We are managing through it and expect relief not until March or so of 2021, as well, the past few weeks there have been some challenges that you may have read about in the industry in terms of delayed delivery times of items just given the number of items being shipped now through third-party carriers. While this may be due to some sales of members are not confident in timely holiday delivery, we, like others, I am sure have done a couple of things. We\u2019ve adjusted our stated expected delivery times on our side and reminded people to shop early. And in our case, we took several hundred non-food items, non-food online items that are also in line and they are providing same day delivery fill-ins to card including items like air pods and insta pods, laptops and many over-the-counter and health and beauty aid items, as well as some other home essentials. In terms of food and sundries, continued limits on some paper goods. Demand in sales went up as COVID began spiking again. A toughest area is, Nitrile gloves, surface cleaning wipes and sanitizing sprays, also in some cases, some paper goods. Overall, dairy items are in good shape, as well as proteins and produce on the fresh side. In terms of our holiday merchandize planning and results, Halloween, we went into a little more conservative in terms of costumes and Halloween-specific candy items. We came out of Halloween with pretty clean inventory levels. Christmas, as I think I mentioned on the last earnings call responding to a question, we went a little more basic in terms of needs and uses for the house. So very strongly we\u2019ve gone into it with fundamental items for the home like housewares, TVs, electronics, even added items like barbeques and pressure washers and furniture items. A little less, we had cut back a little been on seasonal items like holiday decorations and gift wrap and some of the candy and food/gift baskets. In some instances, we already sold through those inventories. Our warehouses overall have remained open and are mostly back to regular hours with an additional hour on any morning for seniors and persons with disabilities. Warehouses are still following social distancing and sanitation guidelines and in some jurisdiction, we have to limit occupancy. Since May 4th, as you may recall, we\u2019ve required members and employees in the warehouses to wear masks and since November, 16th, we\u2019ve required facials for those unable to wear a mask. And some of these initiatives of course will extend well into Q2 of this fiscal year. Finally, in terms of upcoming press releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, January 3rd, on Wednesday, January 6th after market closes. With that, I will open it up to questions and answers and I\u2019ll turn it back to Cindy. Cindy? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simeon Gutman : Hey everyone. Good afternoon. Richard, I wanted to ask following on you talked about some of the merchandizing plans around Halloween and Christmas. You are going to begin to lap some pretty massive surges in growth when you get into 2021. I know you don\u2019t guide, but you are probably planning inventory purchases. So I wanted to ask how you sort of manage with a pretty wide range of outcomes? And I don\u2019t know if you have any guidepost thinking about some of the gains you are making in fresh food as far as the spoilage and the markdowns that don\u2019t seem to be happening. So how do you think \u2013 how do you plan for lapping some of those as well? Richard Galanti : Well, I mean, there is a few different things and time periods that will be and questioned. If we recall, there was a big surge in frequency and sales results. The last week in February, and the first two or three weeks of March, when people were coming in and hoarding in our view, and of course, we were running out of everything basics from water to paper goods, to cleaning supplies and things like that. And in some cases, and then beyond that into April, May, there were some issues as there were some COVID spiking at many fresh plants \u2013 protein plants meat and poultry and alike. And so, it\u2019s hard to project completely. I think I started of late, we have tried to build a little extra inventory where we can and some of the key things that aren\u2019t going to go out of style like paper goods and cleaning supplies. Although then you get to next rush of spiking and whenever extra inventory you had it goes away pretty quickly. Look, we\u2019ll continue to work around it. We work \u2013 and in some cases, it\u2019s a little easier in a sense that we have fewer suppliers to deal with or fewer items to deal with. Arguably, in other cases, given our huge volumes that creates its own challenges sometimes. I think the bigger challenge is going to be post May last year and this past year, when we saw kind of sales strength not just in those key essential categories like fresh foods and foods and sundries, and paper goods and health and beauty aids, but also on the non-food side, items for the home if you will and those types of basic items. And again, people spending some of those dollars. Look, some things will improve and some things may be degraded a little bit. Some things that are degraded may take a while and not everything is going to happen unlike what was not going up one day and everything is going to get better from a food standpoint in terms of restaurants being opened. And so, I think, we are in it together and we feel pretty good that we\u2019ve got a good format to serve our members well and we\u2019ll go from there. Simeon Gutman : And as far as, I don\u2019t know, events, I know, road shows, I don\u2019t know how prevalent they\u2019ve been. Your mailers, are there things that you can change the cadence of either to get more aggressive? Grocery, you\u2019ve taken a huge amount of share this year. Is that an area you are going to lean into stronger? Just curious how are thinking about the merchants are prepping for the upcoming year? Richard Galanti : Well, as it relates to promotional forms that we do like the mailers or even online type of mailers, these are some of those have been changed because some of the big ticket non-food \u2013 not big ticket, I am sorry. Some of the big size items that are always in there like paper goods, like cleaning supplies, in some cases we\u2019ve had to eliminate some of those items from the mailer. We put other items in. In some cases, it\u2019s done fine and in some cases, it\u2019s a little bit less of a sales increase. But that\u2019s not just going forward, that\u2019s been in the last few months as well that we\u2019ve changed those things. I think we\u2019ve been pretty good at pivoting and adding new items. I think the examples of \u2013 for Christmas, while we may have \u2013 maybe and went a little too deep into cutting back, not they were big cuts, but we are running out of some of those decorative things we could do earlier and we would have like to. We also though found success in lots of essential, basic fundamental items. I don\u2019t think \u2013 I mean, the first Christmas, we probably brought in barbeque grills and pressure washers to market. And they are doing well, because people are buying gifts for the home. Simeon Gutman : Yes. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mr. Mike Baker of D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Mike Baker : Hi. Thanks. I was little curious on the holiday trends. Two questions really. One by chance advertising get customers to spread out their sales to come in a little bit early, do you think there is any pull forward of holiday sales into November from December? And then a second part of the holiday question, I think you said that you are out of stock quickly in some of these seasonal items. Do you think you could have made a little bit more aggressive on the seasonal stuff? How much you think your sales could have been up if you had done that? Richard Galanti : Yes. Well, first of all, talking to the buyers, they definitely feel that some of the merchandize and sales were pulled forward into November, not only from December, but even the week of November and there has been articles out there about Thanksgiving and overall, not Costco-specific, but just in general about what\u2019s going on online and what have you. And so, certainly some of that kind of got push forward. In terms of some things, I mean there are examples where instead of buying 10% more this year of a given item, we bought 10% or 20% less. So, we still bought a lot. We just not like we cut our order back by half. But in retrospect, we probably could have sold a little bit more. I don\u2019t have a dollar number. It\u2019s probably not that meaningful. For every negative there is another positive. Needless to our say, our comps overall have been very strong. Mike Baker : Yes. That\u2019s fair. And if I could add \u2013 ask one more, I guess, unrelated question. The MFI, the 7.1% increase, that\u2019s better than it has been. A nice acceleration there. Any color as to where that acceleration came from more in the 4%, 5% range got last few quarters? Richard Galanti : Well, I think, in terms of shopping frequency? Mike Baker : No, membership fee income. Richard Galanti : No. Mike Baker : Correct. Richard Galanti : Oh, I am sorry. Okay. I didn\u2019t hear the first part of the question. Well, I think we opened a few more units than we did a year earlier. Without looking that deeply, that\u2019s probably most of it. Mike Baker : Okay. Fair enough. I appreciate the color. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. Your line is now open. Chuck Grom : Hey, thanks. Hey, good afternoon, Richard. In your online offering, can you remind us where it stands in terms of total mix of business and also level of profitability relative to the store? And looking ahead, what categories you may start going into more? Richard Galanti : Well, I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s sort of in-store of course, and warehouse, we\u2019ve got about 3800 active items. Online, we typically got somewhere in the high single digit thousands, I mean, call it, 9,000 plus. I am sorry, and in terms of sales, it\u2019s about 7% of sales. Now we don\u2019t include in that number as I mentioned like the third party sales like the Instacart Same Day Fresh , because their employee or a contracted employee is coming into Costco shopping just like any other customer coming to shop. So that you could add a little bit more to that. But in terms of what we call online, it\u2019s about 7%. I think it was 6% in fiscal 20 for the entirety, and of course, it was half way through the year when you saw ecom percentages increases jump dramatically with the advent of COVID. Chuck Grom : And then, talk about core profitability. Richard Galanti : Overall, ecommerce a little less profitable. You\u2019ve got category-wise, it\u2019s profitable. You\u2019ve got \u2013 category-wise, you\u2019ve got merchandize categories that don\u2019t include some of the highest gross margin components of our business like fresh, like apparel in a big way in terms of the penetration. You\u2019ve got electronics which is a lower than average margin business both in-store and online and so much bigger percentage of penetration online, so they are examples. Certainly, the profitability of ecommerce has been helped with the types of comp sales increases we\u2019ve had over the past year. But also over this past year, there is some of the cost inefficiencies of growing it so fast. We \u2013 in terms of fulfillment, as we are continually adding locations where to shift out of and getting closer to the customer as this overall size of the business has grown a lot. And as I mentioned earlier, the investment in Innovel, recall, we are calling Costco Logistics, that was a \u2013 as we expected a hit year-over-year to the margin simply because it\u2019s being ramped up and upgrading it. Chuck Grom : Gotcha. And then, just a follow-up on next question and I pardon my near-term orientation of it. But when you look at the comp in November and the fall-off at the end of the month, albeit, it\u2019s still strong, just when you look back if there is any learnings on to why you think sales fell off. And then curious if the revenue trends have started to bounce back. Richard Galanti : I think it\u2019s \u2013 I mean, our best guess is, it\u2019s complete pull-forward. I mean, the fact is, is people marketing bigger ticket items and some of those types of holiday items earlier in November. Unidentified Company Representative : Last Friday, it was promotions and for the whole month. Richard Galanti : Yes, Bob, here mentioned that, Black Friday promotions this year. More of those things we promoted earlier in the month. And not an assessment everybody else out there too. Chuck Grom : Gotcha. All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : And your next question comes from Mr. Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael Lasser : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Nice holiday gifts and some people on this call might be considering getting for loved ones this season. When you look at your sales, compared to the rest of the consumables retail entity, most others are seeing a deceleration in their comps, whereas Costco is seeing an acceleration in its comps. Why do you think that is? Is it\u2019s simply because customers \u2013 members are coming into buy their discretionary goods and moving up their baskets which is the consumable items? Richard Galanti : We definitely think that, look, being essential in recognizing the people clearly are coming in to buy food and cleaning items and health and beauty aids and alike. That gets you in the door. And certainly in our view, given that money is being spent on other things in normal years perhaps is being spent more for things for the home. We have that as well and I think that has helped us in that regard. Michael Lasser : Okay. So, it really comes down to mix and the Costco results to helping that to really consider. Richard Galanti : I buy it. I\u2019d like to think part of it is people feel hopefully, at least relatively safe coming into a big wide open box environment where we\u2019ve done and we think a pretty good job of social distancing and other safety protocols. Michael Lasser : Okay. And the \u201cgross margin increases\u201d it seems like it\u2019s a function of just the strong sales allowing Costco to be able to sell through better than it might. Why is it been able to? Is that right that we should it should have posted \u2026 Richard Galanti : Yes. I think most of it is strong sales which shows its brightest colors with fresh food where you\u2019ve got two cross components that have improved dramatically, spoilage and labor productivity. So, that has certainly helped. Michael Lasser : One other thought on it, like it seems \u2013 sorry. Richard Galanti : Oh, less promotion. The other, Michael is, I think you\u2019ve all read about this from an industry perspective. There has been less promotional activities out there. While we were still getting great values on things, when you look at TVs in general, well, prices have come down across the board just because they always do over time. And these seem to be getting better, bigger and less expensive. There is not the kind of promotional money being thrown at it by the manufacturers because they haven\u2019t had to. And so, I think that too has had some impact. Michael Lasser : That\u2019s helpful. I hope you have a great holiday. Thank you. Richard Galanti : You as well. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Scot from RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : No, the attempt there. Hi guys. Scot Ciccarelli. So, I believe some of the products you guys sell via your website or ecommerce are for members only, but not all of them, or it doesn\u2019t look like that from a \u2013 perspective . So, assuming it\u2019s not just a \u2013 difference, how much of your ecommerce sales are coming from members? Richard Galanti : Virtually all. I believe part of the challenges is on some items as we work with our suppliers and ourselves as well. We want you to be able to have sign in to see the prices. Scot Ciccarelli : I got it. Okay. And then, Richard, what\u2019s the update today regarding how much of your ecommerce sales are being drop shipped from vendors versus kind of delivered through Costco? Richard Galanti : About 50-50. A little less than 50 is being drop shipped. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. All right. Appreciate it. Happy holidays. Richard Galanti : Same to you. Operator : And next question from Karen Short with Barclays. Your line is now open. Karen Short : Hey. Thanks very much. A couple questions I wanted to ask. So, first just on COVID and wages. So, the 212 you called out obviously gave us a breakout on the impact on cost of goods versus SG&A. But that was a little higher than the number, I think the $14 per week that you\u2019ve guided. So, wondering if that\u2019s \u2013 what the delta would have been, because that would have gotten us to about $168 million. And then, wondering if you can give a little color on what the \u2013 like other cleaning component might be would have been in this quarter and then how to think about it in to next quarter, because presumably, does \u2013 like I asked last quarter, that January 3rd date is probably not the undate I would assume. Richard Galanti : Well, we\u2019ll find out. Needless to say I can\u2019t comment on that, but a big chunk of the difference of 14 I may have round \u2013 honestly down to 14 and now it\u2019s rounding up to whatever. But at the end of the day, there is more hours is the biggest delta. More cumulative hours. Karen Short : Okay. Richard Galanti : We have the\u2026 Karen Short : And then the cleaning component. Richard Galanti : That\u2019s relatively small. Karen Short : Okay. And then, I am wondering if you could give a little color on the expansion of the Instacart relationship. You obviously listed a couple of SKUs that you\u2019ve added on to that with respect to the third-party. Can you give a color on what the markup is on non-shoot items versus shoot and then give a breakdown on what that would be for members versus non-members on the markup? Richard Galanti : Well, I can\u2019t be that specific. We continue over the last three or four years, we\u2019ve continued to work to lower the effective average markup across the board on items. There is some discretion on some to be lower than them and some to be higher but there is an average, which includes both their markup, plus whatever other fees that person is spending here, whether it\u2019s a per delivery fee or per monthly fee or per monthly fee to Instacart. As given some of the unique issues during the end of the year with the high demand for shipping, and the capacity issues out there with the third-party shippers we \u2013 given that Instacart is always coming in, we\u2019ve added some items to the tray. In some cases, there is a maximum markup on those that is \u2013 in many cases, smaller than that \u2013 quite a bit smaller than that on that mid to high teen number percentage-wise. Karen Short : Okay. And then just last question. In terms of MFI, obviously, the \u2013 I think, January of 2021 would be the new timeline in terms of the tax deductibility in California. Is there any thoughts in terms of the timeline, in terms of how you would think about. And then, your membership fee increase, because I think in the past you\u2019ve historically done that when you\u2019ve actually seen counter intuitively traffic slowing and it seems like you may be looking at slower traffic to space on tough compares as we get into parts of next year. So, that\u2019s great color on them. Richard Galanti : Well, I mean, historically as you know for 35 years, we\u2019ve effectively raised the basic fee $5 every roughly five years and I say roughly it could be 5, 5.5 years. And the executive membership has been raised to originally started at 100 and now it\u2019s 110 then 120. The last time we did the increase was I believe was in June-ish of 2016. So five years \u2013 it\u2019s June 2016. But it was June of one of the years either 2016 or 2017, but it will be five years from then that we might look. You mentioned that, we\u2019ve done it when things are \u2013 sales have been stronger and when sales have been weaker, when the economies get to hit or whatever else. We look at it and somewhat it dependently at that. We look at it and we feel heavily improved the value of the membership by more than that five or respective $5 or $10. And I am not suggesting we might wait or not, but time will tell. Historically, we\u2019ve always thought very good about when we\u2019ve done it and certainly the value proposition has been enhanced much \u2013 at a much greater multiple than the $5 or $10. Karen Short : Thanks. Have a great holiday. Richard Galanti : Thanks. You too. Operator : Your next question is from Oliver Chen of Cowen. Oliver Chen : Hi. Thank you very much. Hi, Richard. Regarding what\u2019s ahead with vaccinations, do you see a role that your pharmacy will play in that and also in this dynamic environment, how are you thinking about managing inventory versus sales as we look forward to hopefully a pathway to vaccination, et cetera. Thank you. Richard Galanti : I believe there \u2013 we and the country are in the first phase of the vaccination process. We are not participating in that. But I believe Phase 2 which will be just a short period down the road. Our pharmacies will also be part of the many pharmacies throughout the country that are going to be providing the service of vaccinations for them. We are in Phase 1 in the State of Alaska only currently. But I think throughout our country we plan to be in Phase 2 which will be the big push after this first initial round. And in terms of managing inventories, while space is not infinite, certainly the cost of carrying extra inventory isn\u2019t very expensive right now, given very low interest rates. But at the end of the day, as I mentioned, it\u2019s little earlier, we \u2013 I think we plan positively in terms of how our sales have been and to the extent of the example of those seasonal items, we keep down a little bit. But not a lot. And I think we\u2019ll continue to do that kind of planning. A lot of times on items that are short, but there is certainly no risk of having the only risk of having is some extra paper towels for a few weeks is the risk of having them. There is not any obsolescence or markdown risk on it. We always tried in times when there is more of that available, we\u2019ll build up a few extra weeks of supply. But overall, I don\u2019t see a big change in our inventory turns or payable cycles. Oliver Chen : Okay. Ecommerce \u2026 Richard Galanti : I can say that more by comp sales than anything. When we were enjoying a pre-COVID a 6% to 8% comp sales number, inventories as a percent of \u2013 payables as a percent of inventories was whatever the number was. When we saw the big increase in comps, you saw the payables as a percent of inventories going up. Oliver Chen : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And on the topic of ecommerce, as we think about longer term growth rates as well as new customer acquisition that you are seeing an engagement online, what are some of the major catalysts for innovation going forward that you will implement or that you are looking to implement? And then, how do you think growth rates may evolve as hopefully reopening occur eventually? Richard Galanti : Well, look, we even today want things to get back to normal from a business standpoint and also most importantly from a personal standpoint. And over the next couple of years, god willing, starting with this process of vaccinations and vaccines and hopefully a big chunk of this progress through by the beginning or during the summer people will get out more and will be going back to restaurants and alike and will that have an impact on our food sales? Of course, it will. So, some of this positive will be sticky. Some of the new members will be sticky and we\u2019ll go from there. I think that, there are lots of attributes to value and customer loyalty, certainly, the best prices on great quality merchandize that the member trusts in our view is the biggest attribute. And that\u2019s where we start from. We \u2013 ecommerce is certainly \u2013 and the acquisition of Innovel in terms of big ticket items and having a great service and a great value for those items we think helps us. But ultimately, we still want our members to come into the warehouse. When they come in, they see the items and they are more likely to buy some of those items and certainly, driving them with great value and great quality is what we are all about. Oliver Chen : That\u2019s helpful. And last, on that logistics, Costco Logistics part, what should we know about as we model that going forward in terms of the margin headwinds and the dimensions around the size of that business relative to total? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Well, the only two data points we\u2019ve given you is in Q4, year-over-year it was about, I think an eight basis point margin hit and in Q1 which we just reported for this new fiscal year was a six basis point margin hit. As guessing games go, assume that there will be constant improvement in that over the next several quarters. So that it won\u2019t be a negative. That doesn\u2019t include any benefit we get from increased sales of those items and the margin associated with that. But when we bought this we knew that they would be dilutive from an earnings standpoint for the \u2013 certainly in the first year and perhaps into the second year hopefully on a decreasing basis and certainly in the first two quarters it would indicate a little of that. But at the end of the day, we think it \u2013 those companies that have had their own infrastructure to be able to do last mile delivery and installations, it\u2019s a positive certainly the home improvement companies have done that and the retailers and it worked out for us and we are excited about what we can do with it. Oliver Chen : Thank you very much. Happy holidays. Best regards. Richard Galanti : Same to you. Operator : Your next question from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Edward Kelly : Yes. Hi, Richard. Good afternoon. You mentioned freight. I was hoping you could provide just a little more color on the headwind and then you talked about an improvement maybe coming in March. Any more color behind that? Richard Galanti : Not really. Before each call, I\u2019ll sit down with the Head of Merchandizing and some of the other senior people in merchandizing and just get the color on their departments and what\u2019s going on. And it was a by the way comment that, with things coming from Asia as an example, or in general, there is container shortages. And so, we may take a few extra days to get things on to ship. Or the ship may its sailing not full in some cases. The same thing is on some of the big ports in the United States like on the West Coast particularly. They\u2019ve mentioned two to four days of delay. Again, two day for us is not a lot but when you are moving inventory fast, you want to have it \u2013 once it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019ve ordered it, you want to it go to put on the ship and get here in on to our floor. So, it\u2019s not a big deal and the comment was, I said what will improve and said probably not until February, March. So, I just \u2013 that\u2019s what I threw out. Not any more impacts from that. Edward Kelly : Okay. And then, I just had a question on ecom and just digital strategy generally. Any updated thoughts on buy online pick up at store. I mean, you had essentially kind of become a standard offering across the industry and we probably see accelerated a lot of digital adoption. Just curious as to whether you are rethinking that at all. Richard Galanti : We are not rethinking it. We continue to look at it and scratch our heads a little bit. But at this juncture we don\u2019t have any current plan to do so. Edward Kelly : Okay. And then just lastly for you, fuel, I think gross profit per gallon this quarter was probably up quite a bit. I mean, look at the OPEC\u2019s data it looks like maybe double. Is that about right and then what the gallon sold do this quarter? Richard Galanti : We don\u2019t \u2013 the gallons sold were down \u2013 not down as much as they have been and it\u2019s troughed a few months ago and you are right, on margins, that not a double. I can\u2019t give you any quantitative number there. But in terms of margins were up year-over-year as a percent and gallons were down year-over-year. Edward Kelly : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Chris Horvers : Thanks good evening. So, wanted to follow-up on the holiday pull-forward question. I was curious the merchants are thinking about how the season progresses, particularly as we get close to Christmas, some retailers think that given the earlier cut-off time to get the guess in time for Christmas that there could be a big brick and mortar surge. I think other retailers are saying that no what you seen all started like with prime day and it\u2019s just been a pull-forward. So don\u2019t expect anything out of the \u2013 anything unusual close to Christmas too. So, curious what your merchants are thinking. Richard Galanti : Well, merchants are feeling pretty \u2013 I would say, aggressive with this. They feel that, again, some of it was pull-forward. But there is still \u2013 and again, running out of some gift wrapping paper two weeks before you wanted to is not the end of the world. But every sale is a sale that we want. And the same token bringing in fundamental items that if you end up having a few extra SKUs or few extra quantity of certain SKUs the day after Christmas is not going to kill you because it\u2019s not stuff that\u2019s seasonal that has to be marked down in a big way. So, I think that, we can lean it to it recognizing that our sales overall particularly brick and mortar have done well. That we are basing our assumptions on what we are going to do I think over the next two weeks, positive relative to this. Recognizing there could be some pull-forward and it will be some because of the dates got a little longer on shipping. But at the end of the day, we see that \u2013 we are always with you. That should help the in-store experience and we\u2019ll see. Chris Horvers : Got it. And then, in terms of the \u2013 you called out travel and gross margin as a big impact there. Is there something around the counting of that? You haven\u2019t called out prior, maybe it was just because it\u2019s irrelative to other things and the ancillary business. But is there an accounting thing. Is there seasonality to that and would we expect that to sort of get worse for some reason? Richard Galanti : What we can \u2013 like you to do is just like in a 10-K, you got to put the \u2013 you got to rank them in order of dollars. So, in the case of travel, first of all it\u2019s a very high gross margin business. To the extent that we are simply acting as a broker like our car rentals, there is sales and no coast of sales equals gross margin or very little cost of sales. Only when we curate an item and take ownership of it, you will like hundred crew ship weeks or whatever I am making this example up, where you sell $100,000 or something and make a few thousand dollars or $5,000 of margin. That\u2019s a 5%. But you have big chunks of that business that are 80 plus percent margin. So, it\u2019s a business that started to show a little bit of life as we ended December. But with the spiking of COVID in the last several weeks that has dissipated quite a bit. And even some of the life that occurred in the summer were bookings out as for Christmas some of those are being cancelled as you would expect them to be. So, it\u2019s that \u2013 it\u2019s the rank order of them which one hit harder a little bit. Chris Horvers : Got it. And then, the last question is, on price gaps relative to peers and club and grocery, how are you \u2013 what \u2013 have they widened? Where do you see them now? I think if you go back to this 2009 timeframe, where sort of lap peak food at home inflation and you lap some food at home wallet gains. You seem to get more aggressive on price. So, just want to get your thoughts on where you see the price gaps now and how you are thinking about that into 2021? Richard Galanti : Well, I mean, we look at our comp shops compared to warehouse, clubs as well as comps specifically on certain items and at their traditional retail formats, we feel very good about our competitive mote if you will. And we don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue at all for us right now. But we are the ones that keep pushing and pushing the limits further. Chris Horvers : Got it. Have a great season guys. Thanks. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : And next question from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Thanks for the question. Richard, you mentioned that manufacturers, I guess, goods \u2013 they are not promoting as much, not giving as many discount as usual because they don\u2019t have to. Any point you think that could slip the other way? And if so, what would drive it? Is it the body of supply or maybe a more intense competitive environment? Richard Galanti : Gosh! When I find out, I\u2019ll let you know. I mean, what\u2019s happened of course with everything in the strength \u2013 both the strength in electronic items, TVs, air pods and everything else of between and laptops and the demand for those things is enormous and in some cases, some shortages of supplies in general even if capacity has gone up it\u2019s going to overlap more. So, and it\u2019s hard to say. Robert Moskow : Okay. I was thinking more on the lines of package crude, we\u2019ve heard some categories putting promotions back in. Do you have any insight into that? Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t. I am sorry. Robert Moskow : Okay. Alright. Thank you. Operator : And next question Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Richard, hi. Hey, it\u2019s Greg Melich. I think that was me. So, I am showing two questions. One, was there any grocery inflation showing up and we see CPI for growth picking up and there is less promotion. What are you guys seeing there? Richard Galanti : Very, very, very little. Greg Melich : So that\u2019s something but it\u2019s nothing like 4%, 5%, some of those other numbers we see out there. Richard Galanti : Oh, it\u2019s not even 8%. It\u2019s very, very, very low. Three verys. Triple verys. Greg Melich : On cash, the special dividend, congratulations and keeping it special and getting it done. You should be back a little under $10 billion of cash. What\u2019s the right number that you want to run the business with either still during COVID or even on the others side of it. Richard Galanti : Well, keep in mind that there is a chunk of it that is weekend debit and credit card receivables that could be $1 billion or $1.5 billion. There is upwards of just under $1 billion that is related to insurance captives and alike. There is a $2 billion to $3 billion that\u2019s overseas and different countries which for whatever reasons is the last whether you want to bring back because of whatever withholding your other taxes related to it. So, at the end of the day, someone asked the question after we announced the $10 dividend we could have done more. The answer is we could have but why rush? I mean, right now, we still don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with COVID and what may happen next year in the economy. And so, we\u2019ll probably have a little more cash than normal \u2013 than pre-COVID if you will. But that\u2019s okay too. Greg Melich : And then, last, could you just \u2013 what are average rates today? The sort of levels that or the \u2013 we know the COVID up, thanks for that helping us there. But where are we now before all that? Richard Galanti : You mean, the average U.S. hourly wage? . Greg Melich : Yes. Richard Galanti : I think we are in the \u2013 well, ex the $2 we are either right above or just approaching $24 average in the U.S. Greg Melich : Excellent. $24 in the U.S. And so, the \u2013 and the changes for the base rates going up, that was \u2013 you did that, that was completed when? Richard Galanti : In March I believe, last year. Unidentified Company Representative : Last March, Richard Galanti : Last March. Beginning of March. March of 2019. I believe it was at the beginning of March. Whatever that Monday start for that weekly pay period was or bi-weekly period was. And that was $2 across the board. Greg Melich : Right. And the COVID stuff on top of that. Richard Galanti : Excuse me. Greg Melich \\: The COVID that was on top of the actual wage rate. Richard Galanti : Yes. Greg Melich \\: Right. Got it. Great. Well, good luck. Have a great holiday. Richard Galanti : Thanks, you too. Operator : And next question from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Rupesh Parikh : Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So, I wanted to ask about just some of the countries where you have lower COVID infections, China, Australia seems to be normalizing now. How is purchasing behavior in those markets return back to \u2013 whether maybe pre-pandemic. I am guessing, Australia is probably a better read than China? Richard Galanti : They both have stronger comps. Rupesh Parikh : From a carry forward perspective, have you seen the carry forward shift to I guess, maybe where they were pre-pandemic if you look at the mix? Richard Galanti : Well. I don\u2019t have that detail in front of me unfortunately. And when I look at comps by country, in local currencies, we are - in most countries we are back to normal, if not a little better. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Okay, great. And then, just in the U.S. just given we seen spikes in infections and California has had more restrictions recently put in place. I was curious if you can just comment on anything you are seeing more recently in terms of the changes in consumer behavior or traffic to your stores? Richard Galanti : The only thing that I\u2019ve noted is, is that when it first started a few weeks ago, or when \u2013 the California, everyone there was waiting for - in California, everybody was waiting to hear what the new restrictions was going to be in terms of lockdowns. There was a spike in shopping and people were coming in. So, we had particular strength over a couple of week period when more spiking was accruing. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. Thank you. Have a great holiday. Richard Galanti : Thank you. You too. Why don\u2019t we take two more questions? We will take two more questions, Cindy. Operator : Okay. Your next question is from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital. Kelly Bania : Great. Thanks for fitting me in here. Richard, just wanted to back to the buy online and pickup at store question. I know you\u2019ve said for several quarters, now you continue to scratch your head, but it does seem like a lever that maybe you could pull one day that\u2019s already been pulled by pretty much everybody else in retail. But I guess, just given the massive growth that you\u2019ve seen with Instacart and your third-party partners there, this does clearly seem to be a segment of your membership base that\u2019s willing to pay a premium or that markup for that service. So, I am just curious if you thought about even a markup type structure for pickup or even like a higher price point membership for a pickup type service? Richard Galanti : Well, as it relates to general conversations about it, those are topics that are discussed. One of the challenges right now is there is a lot of the buy online and pickup in store traditional retail promotions are at the same prices which you can come in and buy it for. So, somebody is paying for the picking it up and storean waiting for you to pick it up. I think that will shake you out to over time as people \u2013 as somebody has to pay for either the company or the customer. I am not trying to be \u2013 we are looking at all those things, but we haven\u2019t made any decisions to go forth with it. Kelly Bania : Okay. And just maybe quick follow-up, you mentioned the 7% ecom penetration from a sales perspective, but just curious if you could share just the percent of your maybe membership households that are engaged with Costco from a digital ecommerce perspective? Richard Galanti : We don\u2019t give out that information yet. Kelly Bania : Okay. Thanks Richard Galanti : As you might expect, it\u2019s growing. Kelly Bania : Of course. Operator : And the last question from [Indiscernible] of Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for squeezing me in. I just want to follow-up on Rupesh\u2019s earlier question, but ask it a slightly different way which is looking at your cohort of new members that have joined really kind of the third quarter of last year, any performance distinctions or category mix distinctions that might give you encouragement that those members might be a bit more sticky going forward or might be a bit longer lifetime value customers into the future? Thank you. Richard Galanti : We don\u2019t have a lot of that information yet. What we \u2013 recognizing that some of them sign up because of COVID and because we can deliver through Instacart food fresh and or we cans serve them online. But there is not a lot to go on yet. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Richard Galanti : Well, thank you everyone. Hopefully, you have a happy and healthy holiday season and on to better 2021. Have a good day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Q2 Earnings Call and February Sales Conference. I would now like to hand the call over to your speaker today, Mr. Richard Galanti. You may begin your conference. Richard Galanti : Thank you, [Buena] [ph], and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those outlined in today\u2019s call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today\u2019s press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the 12 weeks ended February 14, as well as February retail sales results for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, February 28. Reported net income for the quarter was $951 million or $2.14 per share, compared to $931 million or $2.10 per diluted share last year. This year\u2019s results included $246 million pre-tax or $0.41 per diluted share and costs incurred primarily from COVID-19 premium wages. Net sales for the quarter increased 14.7% to $43.89 billion from $38.26 billion a year ago in the second quarter. Comparable sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 were as follows. For the 12-week period U.S. comps were reported at 11.4% and excluding gas deflation and FX 12.6%. Canada reported at 13.4%, ex gas deflation and FX 10.6%. Other International reported at 21.5%, ex gas deflation and FX 17.7%. All told, total Company reported at 13.0% and ex gas deflation and FX 12.9%. E-commerce on a reported basis was 75.8% and FX 74.8%. In terms of the second quarter comp sales metrics, our traffic or shopping frequency increased 1% worldwide and up 2.7% in the U.S. on a year-over-year basis during the quarter. Our average transaction or ticket was up 11.9% total Company and 8.5% in the U.S. during the second quarter. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by approximately 110 basis points and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 100 basis points. I\u2019ll review our February sales results a little bit later in the call. Going down the income statement, membership fee income came in reported at $881.5 million or 2.01%, compared to $816.4 million or 2.13% in the quarter a year ago, so up $65 million or 8%. Excluding the impact of FX, the $65 million increase would be $56 million, which would represent a 6.9% increase, excluding the impact of FX. No openings occurred in fiscal \u2013 in the second fiscal quarter both this year and last year in the fiscal quarter. In terms of renewal rates, the U.S. and Canadian renewal rate came in at as of for Q2 at 91.0% as of Q2 end. This was up 0.1% from the 90.9% at the end of the prior fiscal quarter. Worldwide our total Company renewal rates were 88.5%, as of Q2 end also up 0.1% from the prior quarter\u2019s number of 88.4%. In terms of number of members as of Q2 end, both member households and cardholders, in terms of households at Q2 end we came in at 59.7 million, up from 59.1 million 12 weeks earlier and total cardholders 108.3 million, up from 107.1 million 12 weeks earlier. As of Q2 end paid executive members were 23.8 million, an increase of 506,000 during the 12 weeks since Q1 end. Moving down the income statement to the gross margin, this year\u2019s gross margin came in at 10.96%, 2 basis points lower than last year\u2019s second quarter on a reported basis of 10.98%. Excluding gas deflation, it would have been 11 basis points lower. As I always ask you, do a little chart here to show some of the components of margin. Two columns, reported and the second column without gas deflation. First line item would be core merchandise. On a reported basis core merchandise margin year-over-year was came in at plus 71 basis points, ex gas deflation, plus 63 basis points. Second line item, ancillary businesses, minus 53 basis points and then without gas minus 55 basis points. 2% reward, minus 6 and minus 5. Other minus 14 and minus 14. So all told on a reported basis year-over-year minus 2 basis points and again ex gas deflation minus 11 basis points. So as you can see from this chart, the core merchandise component was higher ex gas deflation by 63 basis points. Similar to the last several fiscal quarters\u2019 sales penetration has shifted to the core business, resulting in higher contribution of our total gross margin dollars coming from the core operations versus a year earlier. Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation only to their own sales, core on core, if you will, margins year-over-year were higher by 71 basis points. Fresh foods was again the biggest driver here. With strong sales in fresh, we benefited from the efficiency gains and labor productivity and significantly lower spoilage. That being said, the other three major merchandise categories, food and sundries, softlines and hardlines all had higher margin percentages year-over-year in the quarter as well. Ancillary and other business gross margin was lower by 53 basis points and by 55 ex gas deflation in the quarter with most of the negative impact coming from gas and to a lesser extent from the aggregate of travel, hearing aids, pharmacy and food courts offset a little bit by a positive impact from e-com. Costco Logistics, which was our Innovel acquisition a year ago, impacted ancillary margins by 6 basis points to the negative. 2% reward, you can see was impacted negatively by 5 basis points implying that more higher penetration of our sales are coming from the executive membership group. And other is the minus 14 basis points. All of this is attributable to the cost of COVID-19 or about $60 million of the $246 million previously mentioned. These are the direct costs for incremental wages allocated to our manufacturing, production and fulfillment operations. Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the second quarter was higher or worse year-over-year by 11 basis points on a reported basis, coming in at 9.89% versus 9.78% a year earlier. The minus 11 ex gas deflation would have been a minus 3. Again, doing a little chart of comparison with two columns, both reported and then without gas deflation. First line item would be operations, plus 31, so lower or better by 31 basis points. Core operations was on a reported basis. Without gas deflation plus 38, so lower or better by 38 basis points. Central minus 3 basis points and minus 2. Stock compensation plus 3 and plus 3 and other minus 42 and minus 42. You add those columns up on a reported basis again, SG&A was higher year-over-year by 11 basis points and ex gas deflation higher by 3. The core operations component when you look at that was better by 31 or 38 excluding the impact from deflation. SG&A in the core, excluding the COVID-related expenses, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment, was significantly leveraged with a strong core merchandise sales increases. Central, again minus 2 ex gas deflation stock comp, plus 3 both small year-over-year basis points changes together pretty much awash. And other was a minus 42 basis points hit to SG&A, which were incremental wage and benefit costs related to COVID or $186 million of that $246 million total amount. So $60 million of the $246 million hits the margin and $186 million of the $246 million hits SG&A. I\u2019d like to take a minute here and discuss our COVID-related expenses and how they\u2019re changing effective this past Monday, March 1. Over the past 12-month period, March 2020 through February 2021 companywide we expended approximately $1.60 billion pretax on COVID-related items. Of this amount, approximately $825 million related specifically to the $2 an hour extra hourly pay. The remaining $200 million plus was made up of several other items, including the few month period where employees 65 and older were paid to stay home. This was early on during the original lockdowns, cleaning of mass supplies, paying wages to several \u2013 for several weeks to our third-party demo service employees and assisting employees with pay childcare leave which continues. With the $2 an hour extra pay having been paid in for full year that extra amount has been discontinued as of this past Sunday, February 28. And effective March 1, a few days ago, we have implemented a permanent wage increase for hourly employees as well as most salaried warehouse employees. In the U.S. and Canada, we are permanently increasing our starting wage and most wage steps above that by a $1 an hour and increasing our top of scale hourly wage by $0.45 an hour on top of the previously planned $0.55 an hour increase for top of scale. With these changes, our entry level hourly wages will increase from $15 and $15.50 an hour to $16 and $16.50 an hour. Similar type increases are occurring in other countries where we operate. With this change, along with the reduction and/or elimination of several components of the $200 million plus expenses I just discussed, on a going-forward basis this $1 billion plus expensed over the past 12 months will be reduced by a little over one-half starting March 1, which is the beginning of week three in the current fiscal third quarter. Next on the income statement is preopening expense, pretty much the same year-over-year. This year came in at $9 million compared to last year\u2019s $7 million, so $2 million higher. In both fiscal quarters there were zero openings, although this relates to upcoming openings as well. All told, reported operating income for the second quarter of 2021, including the $246 million mentioned earlier showed an increase of 5.8% coming in at $1.340 billion this year compared to $1.266 billion last year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $40 million this year versus $34 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $26 million year-over-year. Interest income itself was lower by $19 million due to lower interest rates. Additionally, FX and other was lower by $7 million. Overall reported pre-tax income in the second quarter was up 3.3% coming at $1.319 billion this year compared to $1.277 billion a year earlier. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the second quarter was 26.4%, a little higher than the 25.9% recorded in Q2 of last year. For all of 2021 based on our current estimates, which of course these are always subject to change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total Company tax rate for the fiscal year to be in the 26% to 27% range. A few other items of note, in terms of warehouse expansion, as I mentioned, we \u2013 there were no openings in Q2. There were eight net new openings in Q1. So we\u2019re eight year-to-date in the second half of the fiscal year, but this quarter, in the fourth fiscal quarter we plan to open 13 more net new units. Five of those will be in the U.S., three will be in Canada and five will be in overseas. Regarding CapEx, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we spent approximately $573 million. Our full year CapEx spend is still estimated in the $3 billion to $3.2 billion range. Moving onto e-commerce, e-commerce sales overall for the quarter ex FX increased 75% year-over-year. A few of the stronger departments over the counter and pharmacy, garden and patio, small electrics, health and beauty and majors, including consumer electronics, total online grocery grew at a very strong rate in the second quarter. The comp numbers just mentioned follow our usual convention. Our usual convention, which excludes our third-party same-day grocery program, which was up 450% year-over-year in the quarter. If we include the third-party same-day in our e-com comps, the 76% reported comp number would have been 96%. Costco Logistics, formerly known as Innovel continues to fulfill a greater percentage of our delivery items and has steadily increased since its acquisition a year ago March. In Q2, we made it a priority to enhance our white club service, which includes assembly or complex installation. It\u2019s now standard on many items and offered as an upgrade on many others. Turning to COVID-19 and some of the issues and impacts surrounding it, we continued to enjoy strong core merchandise sales. I think our buying teams have done a great job keeping our building with stock despite outsized demand on some items and some supply chain challenges as well. From a supply chain perspective, overseas rate has continued to be an issue in regards to container shortage and port delays. This has caused timing delays on certain categories, including furniture, sporting goods, lawn and garden and even some food and sundries items like seafood, imported cheeses and oils. We expect these pressures to ease in the coming months, but it\u2019s impacting everyone, of course. Regarding the pressures from high consumer demand, examples of areas where we have some supply issues on the non-food side, certain electronics due to chip and component shortages like TVs, computers and smart home related items, exercise equipment, bikes and outdoor activity items, lawn and garden items and appliances. On the food side, canned beverages have some shortages due mostly to the aluminum can issue of shortages. Bacon is up 45% in pounds and so for whatever reason, there is a lot of demand there. So there is a little bit of challenges there. Gloves, surface cleaning, wipes and sanitizing sprays and some paper goods. Fresh foods overall is looking pretty good. Our three warehouse curbside pickup test in Albuquerque is ongoing. We don\u2019t really have a lot to add at this time as the test is recent and continuing. The pilot is going well. Our members have responded to it and basket size has actually surpassed our expectations. Our focus of course is how can we be more efficient in doing it and determining if this offering can become scalable and makes a firm sense for us. Turning to our February sales results, the four weeks ended this past Sunday, February 28, compared to the same period last year. As reported in our release, net sales for the month of February came in at $14.05 billion, an increase of 15.2% from $12.2 billion last year. Again, going down the numbers that were in the release. On the U.S. reported basis were up \u2013 on a same-store sale basis were up 10.3%. That\u2019s both reported and without gas and FX. Canada reported 21.6%, ex FX 15.7%. Other International 25.7%, ex FX 20.6%. Total Company 13.8% reported, ex gas and FX 12.3%. Within those numbers e-com 91.1% reported and without gas and FX 89.4%. As with the quarter these numbers \u2013 the e-com numbers would be higher if we included the third-party same-day fresh. When we discussed last year\u2019s February sales results, we pointed out that the fourth week last year had a big uptick in sales. That\u2019s kind of was the beginning of what we felt was a little bit of consumer \u2013 pressure for consumers to buy in for fear of lockdown, again primarily related to consumers buying ahead of the anticipated COVID lockdowns and closures. That positively impacted last year\u2019s February sales by approximately 3 percentage points. Similarly, sales in week four of this February, this week \u2013 week four of this year February were lower as we anniversaried that unusually strong week from a year ago. The estimated negative impact to the February month was approximately 3.5 percentage points. So the reported numbers of 13.8% and ex-gas and FX of 12.3% would have been higher excluding that impact. Our comp traffic or frequency for February was flat to last year worldwide and up 0.7% in the U.S., again some impact of that last week. Worldwide the average transaction was up 13.8%, which included positive impacts of 140 basis points from FX and 10 basis points of the gas inflation. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar benefited February comps in Canada by 540 basis points, Other International by approximately 570 basis points and total Company by 140 basis points. Gas price inflation again positively impacted total reported comp sales by about 10 basis points, whereas the average selling price was about a percentage point higher year-over-year. In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights U.S. regions with strong results for South East, Mid West and Texas. Internationally in local currencies, we saw the strongest results in Korea, UK and Japan. Moving to merchandise highlights, the following comp sales results by category for the month and these exclude the positive impact of FX. Food and sundries were in the positive high-single digits. Departments with the strongest results were liquor, frozen foods and cooler. Hardlines were positive in the high 20%s. Better performing departments were toys and seasonal, sporting goods, hardware and majors, which again is both white goods and consumer electronics for the most part. Softlines were up \u2013 also up in the low 20%s. Better performing departments included housewares, small appliances and home furnishings. And finally, fresh foods were up in the low 20%s. Better performing departments included meat and deli. Ancillary business sales, as mentioned earlier, were down and they were down in terms of sales in the mid-single digits in February, primarily due to lower year-over-year sales in food court hearing aids and gasoline. Overall, relatively a good fiscal second quarter impacted, of course, by COVID expenses, impacted both plus and minus by various aspects of our business due to COVID and certainly as I mentioned in the ancillary, gas had the biggest of the ancillary hits. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases we will announce our March sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, April 4 on Wednesday, April 7 after the market close. With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back to Lena. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good evening, Richard. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on the gross margin expansion that Costco is [doing] [ph] over the last few quarters. Can we assume that as sales slow that you\u2019re just going to give back a lot of these gross margin gain constraints going to go up and all the efficiencies that come along with double-digit comp go away. Or is there anything that Costco has learned that it\u2019s now doing differently that will allow it to hold on to these gross margin [gains] [ph]? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re doing anything dramatically -. we were going to do anything dramatically different. I mean we\u2019re already pretty aggressive on a lot of things. And of course, we\u2019re always trying to drive sales with aggressive value and pricing. Probably the one area which can be a challenge or will be a challenge at some point is fresh. The particular strength in fresh foods for the last several quarters on a year-over-year basis has been the strong fresh has led to higher labor productivity, which is part of the cost component of that if you will manufacturing businesses as well as a lower spoilage or what we call damaged and destroyed in many cases given the strength you\u2019re not throwing away as much stuff at the end of the day or a week, and you\u2019re again be much more productive from a labor efficiency standpoint. At some point, that will subside is my guess. Beyond that, we feel pretty good about our ability to be very competitive and price along that way. Michael Lasser : Okay. And you said going on the - wage expense, going forward this billion dollar plus expense will reduced a little by half early March 1 given the permanent wage increases. So we should just say half the $1 billion or $500 million of expense that Costco has incurred over the last four quarters is not going to go away, even though your wages will be increasing, your SG&A dollars should go down? Richard Galanti : Well, SG&A, and then as I mentioned earlier, the COVID related premium wages the $2, that $800 plus million, a piece of that hit margin because of our manufacturing businesses, the labor involved on the manufacturing side, that\u2019s part of cost of sales. And so again, if you looked at those proportions, I think on the $246 million, we said $60 million related to margin hit and $186 million related to SG&A hit. A simple guess would be you could take that type of percentage of these numbers and apply it quarterly may be a little bit more to SG&A than that those percentages. And so, yes, if you looked at the $1.60 billion that we talked about, and we say a little over half, so simple math would suggest a little over half of that should come back. Although, we\u2019ll stop talking about COVID-related expenses too as we\u2019ve now anniversaried it. Michael Lasser : Understood. Thanks again, Richard. Operator : Your next question is from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Hey Richard, how are you? My first question is also on gross margin. Can you \u2013 I just want to clarify, because there was a big swing in the reported number. Core on core looked pretty healthy, very similar to the prior quarter. You said I think plus 71. And so the big swing here was pretty much mostly gas or all gasoline. And can you remind us, when does the gasoline margin compare peak? Does it get worse before it gets better? Richard Galanti : I \u2013 year ago in the third quarter, we\u2019ve pointed out that it helped us. But it\u2019s like it\u2019s \u2013 it is gas, it is volatile and the profitability in gas goes up and down dramatically. It\u2019s a meaningful business for us. And as prices go up, we generally make less, which has happened of late. And I think not just for us, but the supermarket chains, the other discount stores that operate chains of gas stations. And so we \u2013 again directly try to point that out each time. But there\u2019s no rhyme or reason it can change on a dime. Simeon Gutman : Fair enough. And I guess just to clarify, but it is right the core looks like it was consistent with prior quarters, the big swing and the reported was just then the remainder was mostly due to gas in this quarter, right. Why it was down\u2026 Richard Galanti : Right. Gas is more than half of all those other things [indiscernible] certainly travel is impacted as you well know right now, probably one of - the food courts, because we\u2019re still not open with seating, essentially [indiscernible] as well. So all those are impacting, but gas is \u2013 was the prime mover there. I was looking back at last year, what we call again, what we call warehouse and other businesses, which again gas is a meaning when there are big swings, it tends to be gas is the biggest component of that. A year ago in Q1 versus a year earlier, that\u2019d be Q1 2020 versus 2019. That number I don\u2019t have the detail on gas, but it was 19 basis points to the positive. In Q2 year-over-year, it was 2 to the negative. In Q3, it was 21 to the positive. In Q4 it was 71 to the negative. So you can see it fluctuates. This year in the first quarter, it was 22 to the negative and now 55 to the negative. And again, there\u2019s a lot of components of that number, not just gas, but gas generally tends to be the big mover there. Simeon Gutman : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then my follow-up question is on SG&A. If you look at SG&A year-to-date, so Q1 and Q2, and you exclude all the premium pay, right. We are excluding it from this year, even from last year, it looks like SG&A is still taking a step up year-over-year that\u2019s higher than what looks normal like in prior years. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s incremental wage changes. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything else that\u2019s changed in the business this year-to-date from an SG&A perspective, you\u2019ll have easier comparisons because the premium stuff starts coming up in the back half. But is there any reason why you structurally stepped up in the first half of this year. Richard Galanti : Dollar was \u2013 well, I think it\u2019s a strong sales as a percentage of sales actually, I think you\u2019ll find it goes directionally better. Simeon Gutman : Okay, yes. I was looking on \u2013 yes. Richard Galanti : I\u2019m looking at core operations for all of fiscal 2020 versus all of fiscal 2019 on an ex gas deflation basis was lower or better by 25 basis points. Again, that\u2019s not \u2013 we separate out that below the quarterly stuff or the unusual stuff, the COVID stuff, but the core business was lower or had lower or better SG&A percent by 25 basis points for the entire year. This year in the first two quarters, it was plus 62 and plus 38. So that\u2019s on average 50. Simeon Gutman : Fair enough. Okay. Thank you, Richard. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Horvers of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good evening. So I wanted to follow-up on that February commentary. So last February 2020, you did add a nine and that lasts or you did a 12 and that last week at [a 200] [ph] basis points. So that would suggest you did about a 20 in that the last week of February. And just doing the math, that would suggest that you were just slightly down if it was a 350 base point headwind down maybe on like a stack basis maybe like 1% or 2%. Is that right? Richard Galanti : No, I think I agree with what you said about last year. This year the first three weeks were a little over a 17 and the last week brought that 17 down to our 13.8. Chris Horvers : Right, okay. So yes, you were down. Richard Galanti : Yes. Maybe I explained it differently each year, but yes, basically the 13.8 reported, what \u2013 for the first three weeks was a low 17 and the fourth week caused it to be a 13.8 for the whole four weeks. Chris Horvers : Right. So sorry, your comp down \u2013 right, so your comp down high teens basically. So that \u2013 so as you look ahead it\u2019s interesting because, but at the same time, as you look forward to comparisons remain tough, but you also meter traffic in your stores quite aggressively. I mean I think peers are up double-digits in the month of March and April and you\u2019re actually down in April. So can you talk about to what degree do you think you actually left business on the table, as we think about just trying to model out against these comparisons going forward? Richard Galanti : Well, I can\u2019t speak for others. We\u2019re frankly thrilled with our sales numbers in our and how we\u2019ve done over the course of the last year. As you look at both March and our fiscal third quarter March, this giant step up in sales and traffic and hoarding, if you will, by customers started in week four of February and lasted through about 2.5 weeks into March. So we\u2019ll talk about it specifically when we report March sales, as it relates to the fiscal quarter, which is essentially mid-February to mid-May, I don\u2019t have the exact dates in front of me, but that 12-week period and included not only that tough comparison for those 3, 3.5 weeks, which included week four February and weeks, one, two, and part of three in March, but also when there was a lockdown and offset and that, and kind of late March into April and even early May, we had some very tough compares. And so that\u2019ll make it in our view, all things be equal, an easier comparison. So I think there\u2019s going to be a plus and a minus that probably add up to about even we\u2019ll see. The next challenge of course, will be Q4, which is a mid-May through the end of August. That\u2019s what we enjoyed comps in the 12% to 15% range on an ongoing basis into September, October as well. But for Q4 where we saw a lot of strengths, not only on the food side, but on the non-food side as people are buying things for the home as they weren\u2019t traveling or going to sporting events and the like. Chris Horvers : Okay. And I just want to follow back up on the February math, sorry to delay this, but it was \u2013 where you actually modestly positive in that last week, it just under comped the average and it brought it down. Richard Galanti : Modestly positive, yes. Chris Horvers : Got it. Understood. Thanks very much. Richard Galanti : Yes. Operator : Your next question is from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. Chuck Grom : Hey, thanks a lot, Richard. I know that\u2019s kind of has been a drag on the top line, but when you look at your business geographically and overlay that with markets that are maybe a bit farther along in the reopen process. Just I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve noticed any improvement in gas gallons. Richard Galanti : You are a little bit, overall I mean our gas gallons year-over-year, I think in was February the quarter and the quarter were down 9% or 10%, which is an improvement \u2013 relative improvement. And within that, in some of the regions like in the South, Texas, Florida, you\u2019ve seen a little better improvement. Chuck Grom : Okay, great. Thank you. And then just on the balance sheet inventory dollars are up 17% \u2013 roughly 17% is a little bit ahead of sales. I guess how are you feeling about the currency of inventory as you transition out of for insurance and some of the spring items? Richard Galanti : Yes, we made a conscious effort a couple of months ago. I think even on the last quarterly call, we talked a little bit about some of the challenges with port delays both on the farm side of where the merchandise is coming from, as well as the ports along the West Coast of North America in particular and container shortages. So we were front-loading and not everything came in short. So we have frontloaded items that are not seasonal items or frontloaded extra inventory of basics. And so I\u2019m not concerned about that at all. Chuck Grom : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Baker of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Mike Baker : Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask about your view on inflation, obviously pricing in the market. One of your big competitors talk about being satisfied with their price gaps, which maybe means it\u2019ll be a little bit less pricing pressure out there. So how do you think about that? And again, how do you think about inflation it\u2019s spiked mid-year sort of moderating a little bit, but now commodity costs back up, maybe it goes up again from here. Richard Galanti : Well, I\u2019d say in the last several months, we\u2019ve seen a little more inflation than we had in part because of some of the container shortages, freight costs are a little higher, there\u2019s some high demand items or product shortages due to supply chain in general, that we want up. When asked on a broad stroke basis on some of these items, what type of inflation we\u2019re seeing, sometimes as much as 2% to 4%, sometimes less than that. And on meat, it\u2019s trended upward in the mid-singles, pork in the high-singles. That\u2019s why bacon, I mentioned bacon and \u2013 but we feel good about our competitive ability. We\u2019re \u2013 we always want to be the last to raise and the first to lower. And but we feel, again, as you look at our margins, we feel good about where our margins are coming in and our ability to be very competitive out there. Mike Baker : Okay. That makes sense. So are we seeing our panic buying and bacon yet or not at that point yet? Richard Galanti : Probably tomorrow, because I mentioned it. Mike Baker : Exactly. I\u2019m heading there tonight. Thanks. Richard Galanti : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Karen Short of Barclays. Your line is open. Karen Short : Hi, thanks. I wanted to get back to this SG&A and/or I guess gross margin question. So when I look at the EBIT growth in this quarter versus sales growth, and I back out COVID costs. The second quarter was by far the narrowest gap. So 3Q, 4Q, 1Q, 2Q like you were a third of what you were in 1Q, like half \u2013 more than half or less than half of what you were in 4Q, 3Q. So it clearly is a question of like the gross profit dollar growth versus the SG&A growth. So I guess I\u2019m wondering, can you just talk through that a little bit more, because the change in this quarter, this is somewhat glaring. Richard Galanti : Yes. Well, I think again Karen gets back to gas. Gas is a high sales dollar number and the impact to somebody put me on mute please. The impact of gas is both dollars and average price to lower gross margin as well. That\u2019s really the biggest piece of it. Karen Short : Right. But I\u2019m talking EBIT dollar growth, excluding COVID costs versus the sales. So I guess, yes, I mean I guess sales I have to adjust for gas, but it just still seems like a very widespread or why\u2026 Richard Galanti : Well, I can just, again, without being specific \u2013 dollar specific, the biggest dollar impact year-over-year profitability of, if I \u2013 when I mentioned these various pluses and minuses was gas. Karen Short : Okay. Richard Galanti : And the combination in it\u2019s a 10%-ish piece of our business, which had a lower gross margin and lower dollar price per gallon. Both of those things would touch to lower sales, lower profits, and that\u2019s impacted. Karen Short : Okay. And then just turning to the forward look on gross margin, obviously appreciating the fact that strength and the fresh strength will hurt potentially gross margins as we get into the next couple months. But ancillary should I guess help offset some of that appreciating gas may is you can\u2019t predict that, but can you maybe talk through the dollar buckets of gross profit dollars in the other categories within ancillary? Richard Galanti : Well, again, travel should improve recognizing how much will reprove we\u2019ll wait to see, but its starting to improve a little bit. Food courts will improve the same thing as we start to put out seating and expand what we offer there. Now when that occurs and how that occurs, we\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re probably going to do it in certain regions first and go from there. Gas is the big unknown in the big guesstimate of which direction it goes each week. But we\u2019ll, again, try to point that out to you. Here, we\u2019ve seen a \u2013 we have seen a period improvement in hearing aid and optical. Karen Short : Okay. And then just last one for me. Is there any impact of the SG&A dollars from the enhanced white glove service that you could call out? Richard Galanti : There is a better efficiencies, although keep in mind, we\u2019ve really grown this thing fast of taking our \u2013 some of our existing, not only have these departments grown dramatically in the last year. We were using third parties for a lot of it, and we continue to push more on there and to improve the service, to lower the price. And so I think you should see that should continue to improve, but it was not without its costs to accomplish all that in the last quarter. Karen Short : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Paul Lejuez of Citigroup. Your line is open Unidentified Analyst : Hey everyone, [indiscernible] on for Paul. I was wondering if we could circle back on the inflation question and kind of go through some of the puts and takes of inflation items that you\u2019ll be anniversary coming up in the coming quarters. Richard Galanti : Well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re anniversary any of them as soon. It\u2019s just starting to happen in the last month or two. And again, a lot of it has to do in our view. You\u2019ve had a little bit of inflation over the last year with on things like paper goods, because of just a huge demand in the shortages. But in terms of some of the recent things with container shortages and port issues, some supply issues on chips and components of big ticket items as you know cost of Steelers up 50% to 100%. All those things impact that. I think it\u2019s more \u2013 if this has happened in the last several months versus a year ago. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Can you quantify the impact of freight costs and some of the container issues that ahead on this most recent quarter? Richard Galanti : I can\u2019t off with the notes that I have in front of me. I mean, anecdotally, if you look at what is the cost per container coming over used to be its up 10% to 15%. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s it for now. Thank you. Richard Galanti : Yes. Operator : Your next question is from Scott Mushkin of R5 Capital. Your line is open. Scott Mushkin : Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. So I kind of wanted to think about the business more strategically Richard and understand, we went through a period where you did the Citibank deal, and then you guys didn\u2019t talk too much about it, but you really expanded your fresh offerings, which I think helped the clogs and drive some traffic. I was wondering if you think about the business over the next couple of years, and we think about kind of self-help initiatives. Where do you think there\u2019s some levers that you guys can pull? Richard Galanti : Well, I think first of all, some of them are ongoing. Kirkland Signature continues to be something that will continue to increase the offerings that we do. There aren\u2019t a giant billion dollar ones, items like that. There\u2019s a handful of items like paper towels and toilet paper and water that are huge. There\u2019s the cake cups and those things that are in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but there\u2019s lots of 20s to 100s out there. And we continue to do that with all kinds of quality, organic packaged food items as well. I think one of the things that we\u2019ve seen from some of our vertical integration starting to pay off, we\u2019ve got the chicken facility at full capacity now. We\u2019ve got a great bakery commissary, we \u2013 two years ago, we opened a second meat plant. We\u2019re seeing some improvement from that. We\u2019re also starting to identify items that historically we manufactured in one place, generally the United States, and then shipped all over the world, whether it\u2019s roasting of nuts and cashews. And yes, and doing bringing all that product from where it\u2019s grown to the U.S. for roasting and packaging and shipping out worldwide. We now have a supplier in Asia that is doing all the needs for Asia, Australia, and dramatically we\u2019re able to \u2013 or dramatically reduce the price and drive sales and drive bottom line dollars for us. We\u2019re doing that with all kinds of \u2013 we\u2019re looking at all kinds of avenues to do that with from paper goods to things like that as well. So I think these are long-term opportunities, but there should be a lot of them over the next several years. Also e-com notwithstanding, our start back in the early 2000s, we like everybody has that\u2019s become more important over the last year in particular, it\u2019s approaching 10% of our business and continue to grow nicely and we\u2019re driving \u2013 we\u2019re getting better at doing it and getting more clicks and the like, and that regard. So I think e-commerce and then the big and bulky our acquisition of Innovel last March, all you see now, and we pointed out, I think for the last three fiscal quarters, a 6 or 7 basis point hit to gross margin as it relates to the \u2013 it\u2019s like in manufacturing, it\u2019s a service business that goes ultimately back into our cost of sales, what that thing costs. Notwithstanding the fact that that has helped drive sales of big and bulky items. And in fact, lowered the prices to our members on some of those items. So we think that\u2019s as expected, it was going to be earnings dilutive at the operation standpoint for the first couple of years and be fine there, but more as importantly, if not more importantly growing big and bulky as part of our business, we\u2019re seeing big \u2013 continued big increases from mattresses to white goods to exercise equipment, notwithstanding the fact that there\u2019s been some shortages in some of those items. Scott Mushkin : That\u2019s great. Thanks for all the color. That was perfect. Operator : Your next question is from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So as you guys get food inflation on meat, pork, et cetera, our price increases there a direct pass through to the customer. Or do you guys try to be sticky on some of your prices the way you have been with rotisserie chickens, for example. Richard Galanti : I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be as extreme as the old chicken example from 15 years ago, where we stuck with continue to stay at 499 and figure out ways how to do that. But certainly, we are \u2013 we want to be the last, we want to be as sticky as possible and hold off and we\u2019ll wait until our cost has come through the system. But overall, particularly on fresh items, those prices probably change more often than not both at traditional supermarkets, as well as the Costco\u2019s world. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. And then you\u2026 Richard Galanti : And in fact, the other thing I want to mention is, we\u2019re a little unique in terms of our product mix. When you look at it, we\u2019re selling part of our meat business is prime. And those are the types of things where we can get a strong margin for us and show you a greater savings because the markups traditionally on something like that special item, or even higher at traditional retail outlets. So we think overall we\u2019re a good stead in that regard. Scot Ciccarelli : That\u2019s helpful, Richard. And then you did mention your chicken plant, as you know, I think it\u2019s been for a bit fully up and running. Are you generating the efficiencies you guys originally anticipated when you first went down that, that road? Richard Galanti : We\u2019re pretty close. I mean we\u2019re at full production, which is similar. There\u2019s been some puts and tastes. We \u2013 as we built it, we decided to put in additional things that we think provide for higher quality product like air chilling and things like that. The COVID expenses certainly have impacted us more than nobody had planned for it. So that of course, should improve over the next year. I think it\u2019s \u2013 the feed costs, we\u2019ve been fortunate. Historically, we\u2019ve been \u2013 the first year we were fortunate feed costs are coming up a little bit, but we\u2019re also finding that the chickens are growing a little better than we thought. And so all those things add up to we feel pretty good about it. Scot Ciccarelli : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. I just \u2013 I want to start just to clarify the inflation at the risk of being for a comment on it. You said that there are items that are higher, right. But the 2% to 4% comment, Richard, was that saying what you actually think it is now in your average ticket? Or is that just saying some items are in other words just, would you estimate the whole benefits like 1% or 2% right now? Richard Galanti : Yes. Some categories are in that 2% to 4% range and some are little, I mentioned are like meat and pork are a little higher than that, produces flat, but I \u2013 we don\u2019t do life anymore, but I think if you look at our costs on average, the view is probably flat up 1%, 1.5%, but somewhere in that range that\u2019s I guess. Greg Melich : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for that clarification. Second is what you went through the renewal rates, I guess as you\u2019re thinking about it now what do you think you could really get renewal rates to, and maybe tie it in with some of the other things you have to really drive loyalty, like the credit card program. Any update there in terms of what sort of engagement you have with it, what percentage of customers or sales are on the card to help us understand where that renewal rate could be trending? Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, look, what we internally call the triple plays, not only getting to become a member, but upgrade to the executive member and then to apply and get the Citi Visa card, recognizing that not everybody that applies for it gets it based on credits that\u2019s \u2013 that credit decision is made by issuing bank, not by us. And the \u2013 sorry, I lost my train of thought, but renewal rate \u2013 in terms of improving renewal rate, as we do add people to the credit card and to executive membership, both of those things tend to increase provide for more loyal customer or a high renewal rate. Also we\u2019re doing more things to get you to auto-renew whether it\u2019s on the Citi Visa card or working on some other areas right now as well, to be sent we get you to auto renew by almost a facto there\u2019s going to be a high renewal rate on those as well. First and foremost, ultimately if the things we do to make you want to remain a member of Costco, we think that some of those things like upgrading to executive membership, which we\u2019ve shown you continues to be part of our quarterly positive there, as well as getting more people to auto renew. Can you hear me? Greg Melich : Yes, I can. That\u2019s better. Richard Galanti : Sorry. Greg Melich : We heard that, okay. And last, is there any hope on travel bookings? And I sort of glimpse is there that still depressed? Richard Galanti : It is coming back, but it\u2019s the same thing I said back in the spring, in the summer when there was some easing of COVID statistics and people were starting to book out for Christmas and even into the winter and spring of 2021, but they did it knowing that there was generally full cancellation capabilities. We\u2019re now seeing, and as you might expect, many of those things were canceled. Now we\u2019re seeing the same thing again. We\u2019ve also \u2013 travel department, we\u2019re doing pretty well, relatively speaking on car rentals. And as it relates to travel and hotel bookings, we have added some additional domestic items and Mexico items for the domestic \u2013 for the U.S. domestic market as well. Hawaii and Mexico are pretty strong. Again, within the relative framework, there is some four and five star things that we\u2019ve gotten in other parts of the world, which wouldn\u2019t talk to us a few years ago, but so, we\u2019re optimistic it\u2019s going to come back and expected. And we\u2019ve certainly, I think improved our offerings. Greg Melich : Excellent. I guess putting a hard pressure monitors across from the bacon going forward and good luck. Richard Galanti : There\u2019s a fast food retailer out there that has a interesting name for that. Anyway, why don\u2019t we have two more questions? Operator : Your next question is from Greg Badishkanian of Wolfe. Your line is open. Spencer Hanus : Hi, this is Spencer Hanus on for Greg. My first question is how should we think about how much of the share gains you have this year you\u2019ll retain. And then the low-single digit comp in the last week of February, how did that compare to your internal expectations? Richard Galanti : Well, I\u2019ll answer the last question first. I mean we \u2013 all we knew is that week four of February compared to a year ago and weeks one and two, and part of three of March were going to be tough compares. I think we actually did a little better than we thought, but still it was a low number given the strength a year ago. And I\u2019m sorry, what was your first question? Spencer Hanus : Market share, TV market share. Richard Galanti : TV market share, look at the end of the day, some of it\u2019s going to be sticky and some of it\u2019s not. We all personally hope that restaurants will reopen and we\u2019ll all be able to go out and enjoy and socialize that will impact retail food sales at Costco and supermarkets, and the likes to some extent. That being said there are other retail formats, whether it was restaurants and food that have closed for good, apparel retailers, other general merchandise retailers. So in some ways, some of the stickiness unfortunately relates to certain aspects of retail that have closed for good. And some of it will be that they\u2019ve gotten more comfortable buying some of these things from the likes of Costco. I hope we lose some of it to the examples of restaurants and the like, and other stores that were impacted as they can reopen. And \u2013 but I\u2019m sure that we will end up keeping a little bit of it as well. Spencer Hanus : That\u2019s helpful. And then for the new members that you\u2019ve recruited during COVID, how are they different than previous cohorts? And are you expecting to see renewal rates in line with the overall company average? Richard Galanti : Whenever we sign up a member, if you look at our 90% point whatever percent renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada, that includes some 10-year plus members that are 93% or 94% or 5%, and include some members that have in the last two years, that might be mid-70%s to mid-80%s. So you\u2019re always from zero to year one to renewal, it\u2019s going to be a lower rate in year one to year two, it\u2019s a combination of two-year members plus some new one-year members picks that renewal rate up. My guess is some of these new ones again, they\u2019re going to follow that format. The other thing though, is in some cases, we think we\u2019ve gotten new members sometimes in markets where we don\u2019t even operate physical stores, not a lot, but it can\u2019t hurt. Spencer Hanus : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Rupesh Parikh : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So Richard, I just wanted to ask you just about e-commerce fulfillment capacity. So you guys are obviously registered very strong growth last several months. So just curious where you guys are from a fulfillment perspective and whether you would expect to see a step up in investment going forward. Richard Galanti : Well, I think there has been a step up in the last couple of years, and it\u2019s continued this year. We are building additional fulfillment as we speak fulfillment capability. We\u2019re getting better at it, but so is everybody that\u2019s, I\u2019ve seen this kind of wild growth. In some ways, we think it may be easier for us because of the fewer items. We\u2019re doing the two-day groceries still through our business centers, which works pretty smoothly. So it is a larger percentage of the $3-ish billion we spend every year than it used to be, but certainly the biggest single percentage is still opening new warehouses. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So clearly, you guys have \u2013 sorry, go ahead. Richard Galanti : In addition to physical capital expenditures, there\u2019s also IT capital expenditures, which is part of our CapEx as well. And there\u2019s a lot of investment in that around everything from e-commerce from mobile app to fulfillment in the like. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. And then just given the announcement on the increase in minimum wages, do you see any other levers going forward that can offset some of the wage pressures that we\u2019ve seen maybe on a multi-year basis in your business? Richard Galanti : From the beginning, I used to think about that question 30 years ago. And what we find is, is that we\u2019re always able to, because we\u2019ve got a great employee base and that are hardworking and loyal and know that we care, we as a company are, they are cared about. I think that we feel that we\u2019ve seen over the years, everything from inventory shrink to labor productivity, certainly we measure these things too, but labor productivity, and a lot of it has to do with coming up with ideas many of which are these ideas come from our employees that are on the ground, if you will working in the meat department, figuring out how to be more efficient with pounds per hour, per labor hour. So we\u2019ve always figured out ways, not worried about let\u2019s figure out how to save it, and then we can give it, pass it onto them, let\u2019s pass it on and we\u2019ll get there from an efficiency standpoint. And it seems to have worked for us. Rupesh Parikh : On the CapEx basis\u2026 Richard Galanti : Yes. Other things like, we\u2019re now have self-checkout in 60% or 70% of our 558 Costco\u2019s in the U.S. It\u2019ll be on virtually all of them. And we\u2019ll see in another countries as well. That\u2019s the savings that took us awhile to believe part of it and to figure it out, I think we\u2019re on the third format of it, the version of it, but it\u2019s working in our environment the way we want it to, and we see savings there. So we\u2019re constantly figuring those things out. And we attribute a lot of that to many of these good ideas don\u2019t come from the rooms here at the office. They come from the people out on the floor. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Edward Kelly : Hi Richard, thanks for letting me here. I just want to go back, first of all on the ancillary gross margin, you talked about gas being a bit more than half, so the remainders pandemic related, I guess 15, 20 basis points. Has that drag been consistent there since the pandemic began? So if I look back over the other quarters, whatever sort of remainder there would just be the gas movement. Richard Galanti : Yes. I think it was worse last year in Q3 and \u2013 but it\u2019s been similar. It\u2019s improving a little right now, but still negative year-over-year. The big delta is as you had gas and quarters where we talked about gas was a big positive. It offset \u2013 more than offset some of these other negatives. Edward Kelly : Right. Okay. So we have that coming back when life normalizes, then when you look at the other segment of the gross margin, how much of that\u2019s going to come back because the 16 with the wage increase play a role there. So should I assume only half of that comes back? Richard Galanti : Well, I think from simple math, we talked about the $246 million for this quarter in total for COVID-related and of that $60 million impacted margin. So $60 million over $246 million, whatever that percentage is a little under 25%. And on an annual basis, we talked about the $1.60 billion a little over half. So just take half of that. And that\u2019s kind of the net improvement or pre-tax improvement in margin from that. But there \u2013 I\u2019m sure if there\u2019s other outliers, we\u2019ll explain them to you as we go into each quarter. Some of the things that\u2019s a easy one, because it\u2019s big and we know what we\u2019re doing with it. The unknowns are how quickly will travel come back. Travel is a very high margin, low SG&A business. Food courts, it\u2019ll improve dramatically once we get tables out there everywhere, and that\u2019s not going to happen tomorrow afternoon, but it\u2019s going to happen God willing over the next several months. Edward Kelly : Okay. And just one last one for you on, so on the core, historically the core margin really hasn\u2019t been up, it\u2019s obviously doing very well right now going forward, I mean you could still have maybe mix benefit from things like stimulus, but don\u2019t we eventually just sort of assume that what we\u2019ve seen over the last few quarters sort of normalizes back to pre-COVID level and we take the margin down by that I mean. Richard Galanti : I feel a little stronger than that, in terms of the positive. I think that on the fresh side, yes. At some point, when you have your tougher year-over-your compares, you\u2019re not going to get those big basis point improvements from spoilage and labor productivity. Now some of it though, at these new levels, you have more productivity. We\u2019re not going to necessarily lose it all. But if it\u2019s a tough compare, you\u2019ll lose a little, you\u2019ll lose some of it. So yes, on some of the other categories, particularly as we increase Kirkland Signature, as we sell certain things within fresh that are specialty items, where we can get a full margin and showed even greater savings in some cases, some of the vertical integration some of the things I mentioned, like the nuts and cashews, these are all little things, but those tend to offset some of those things. I\u2019m not suggesting we\u2019re going to keep it all, but I think that we\u2019re going to do better than people are than the question as a concern about. Edward Kelly : Great. Thank you. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Well, thank you for listening. We\u2019re all here. If you have any additional questions, you know who we are. Have a good afternoon. Thank you, Blenna [ph].

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Richard Galanti. Sir, you may begin. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Sarah, and good afternoon to everyone. I'll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.  In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 to 12 weeks ended this past May 9. Reported net income for the quarter was $1.220 billion, or $2.75 per diluted share. Last year's third quarter net income was \u2013 they came in at $838 million, or $1.89 per share. This year's third quarter included $57 million pre-tax, or $0.09 per share in COVID-19-related costs. Last year's third quarter included $283 million pre-tax, or $0.47 per share of COVID-19-related costs.  Net sales for the quarter increased year-over-year in the quarter by 21.7% from $44.38 billion -- to $44.38 billion this year from $36.45 billion a year ago. Comparable sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 were as follows : in the U.S., on a reported basis, sales were - comparable sales were up 18%, ex gas inflation, up 15.2%; Canada, on a reported basis, up 32.3%, ex both gas and strong Canadian dollar, ex gas and FX, up 16.7%; other international reported plus 22.9%, ex gas and FX, plus 13.1%. All told, company reported comp sales of 20.6% and, again, ex gas and FX, 15.1% up; e-commerce, on a reported basis, was 41.2%, ex FX was up 38.2%, and that's on top of a year ago in the third quarter when it was up 66.1% in Q3 a year ago versus the prior year to that.  In terms of Q3 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 12.5% worldwide and plus 11.9% in the U.S. Our average transaction or ticket was up 7.3% worldwide and up 5.7% U.S. during the third quarter. And these numbers include the positive impact both of gas inflation and FX. So adjusting for that, they would be in the 1.8% and 2.7% in the U.S. adjusted for those.  Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by approximately 290 basis points. And gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 260 basis points.  Going down the income statement. Membership fee income reported for the third quarter, $901 million or 2.03% of sales. Again, we had strong FX, and so adjusting for that out, the $86 million reported increase would have been up $67 million, so FX up 8.2%, on a reported basis, up 10.6%.  In terms of renewal rates, the U.S. and Canadian rate of -- came in at 91.0%, the same as it was at Q2 end. Worldwide, our total company renewal rate was 88.4% at Q3 end or 0.1% lower during the prior quarter-end. China entered the renewal calculation for the first time this fiscal quarter. First year renewal rates generally lag those of later years. And excluding China, the worldwide rate would have actually improved 0.1% versus the prior quarter. In terms of number of members at Q3 end, both member households and total cardholders. At the end of third quarter, total paid households 60.6 million, up from 59.7 million 12 weeks earlier. Total cardholders, 109.8 million, up from 108.3 million at the end of the second quarter 12 weeks ago. At Q3 end, paid executive membership totaled 24.6 million members, an increase of 817,000 during the 12 weeks since Q2 end.  Moving down the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the third quarter was lower year-over-year by 35 basis points, coming in at 11.18% compared to a year ago at 11.53%.  As I usually do, I ask you to jot down a few numbers, two columns : both the reported year-over-year change in gross margin; and the second column, ex gas inflation. Merchandise core, reported minus 52 basis points year-over-year and ex gas inflation, minus 29 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses reported plus 2 basis points and ex gas inflation plus 7 basis points. 2% Reward, plus 1 basis point and minus 2 basis points. Other, plus 14 basis points in both columns. Total, therefore, reported gross margin, again, year-over-year was reported down 35 basis points and ex gas inflation down 10 basis points.  The core merchandise component, as you show here, was -- as I mentioned here, was down 52 basis points year-over-year on -- and down 29% on ex gas inflation. This is primarily a function of sales shifting from core to ancillary versus last year as we begin to revert back to more historical sales penetrations. Recall, last year, we saw a significant shift of sales out of ancillary and other businesses and into the core. In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in third quarter, the core and core margin were better by plus 27 basis points, with nonfoods up significantly, rebounding from last year's lows. Food and sundries flat year-over-year and fresh foods down from last year, the latter still strong by historical standards.  Fresh, as we've mentioned over the last few quarters, is lapping exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outsized sales that began a year ago in Q3 with the onset of COVID. Ancillary and other business gross margins, again, ex gas inflation was up 7 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. We have a lot going on here as of last year we \u2013 as last year, we had closed the hearing aid and optical departments and had severely limited the service and selection at our food courts for most of Q3 last year. Gas had a particularly good quarter a year ago, which had helped to offset some of those closures a year ago. This year, we're showing margin improvement in optical, food court, e-com and hearing aids, somewhat offset by gas.  The 2% Reward was, again, on excluding gas inflation, was lower by 2 basis points, indicating higher sales penetration to our executive members and the rewards associated with it. And other is plus 14 basis points. 9 of the 14 basis points is attributable to lower COVID-19 costs year-over-year. $44 million hit to margin in Q3 a year ago versus a $14 million hit to margin this year in the third quarter. Last year, we incurred 10 weeks of the incremental $2 an hour premium wage. This -- that portion you see here relates to the labor associated with our fulfillment manufacturing businesses. This year, we incurred two weeks of the incremental two-hour -- the incremental $2 an hour premium wage as the program was discontinued at the end of the second week of Q3 after 52 weeks in place.  The other plus 5 basis points or $19.7 million came from accruing a reserve last year in Q3 for certain third-party gift cards and ticket programs that were adversely impacted by the onset of COVID. One other comment, as I discussed during our March 4 Q2 earnings conference call. In conjunction with the discontinuing of the $2 an hour premium pay, we implemented a permanent wage increase for our hourly employees as well as most of our salaried manager employees, which took effect in week three of this fiscal quarter. Since it's a permanent wage increase going forward, its impact is simply in our reported numbers and not separated out as COVID-related. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the third quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 107 basis points. Again to jot down these following 2 columns and numbers, first column is reported, and second column, excluding gas inflation. In terms of operations, year-over-year, plus 37 basis points, meaning lower or better by 37 basis points, ex gas inflation, plus 20 basis points. Central plus 4 basis points and plus 1 basis point; stock compensation, plus 5 and plus 4; other, plus 61 and plus 61. For a total, on a reported basis, again, SG&A year-over-year was lower or better by 107 basis points on a reported basis and excluding gas inflation, better by -- or lower by 86 basis points.  Again, looking here, the core operation was better by 37 and plus -- better by 20, excluding the impact of gas inflation. A good result, particularly given that we implemented a permanent $1 an hour wage increase for the last 10 of the 12 weeks that comprise Q3. Central, nothing surprising there. Same with stock comp, and other, the plus 61 basis points ex gas inflation, 56 of the 61 was attributable to the lower cost from COVID. $239 million hits SG&A in Q3 a year ago compared to $44 million in Q3 this year. The balance or plus 5 basis points, lower by 5 basis points, was $18.5 million were cost associated with the acquisition and integration of Innovel a year ago. Next on the income statement is preopening expense. Basically, this year, it was -- it came in at $10 million, $2 million higher than the $8 million in Q3 of fiscal '20. Nothing out of the ordinary with the preopening this quarter.  All told, reported operating income in Q3 '21 increased 41%, coming in at $1.663 billion this year compared to $1.179 billion a year ago in the quarter.  Below the operating income line, interest expense was $40 million this year versus $37 million a year ago. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $6 million or better by $6 million. Interest income was actually lower by $2 million year-over-year due to lower interest rates. Additionally, FX and other was higher by $8 million year-over-year.  Overall, reported pretax income in the third quarter was up -- reported pretax income was up 42%, coming in at $1.650 billion this year compared to $1.163 billion a year ago. In terms of e-commerce, our e-commerce sales, as I mentioned earlier -- I'm sorry, before I go to e-commerce, our tax rate in the third quarter came in at 25.2% compared to 26.7% a year earlier. This quarter benefited from onetime discrete tax item that benefited our number.  For all of '21, based on our estimates, which, of course, are, sadly, subject to change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total company tax rate for the year to be in the 26% to 27% range. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, in Q3, we opened 6 new warehouses, 1 in the U.S.; 3 in Canada; and 2 internationally. We also have plans in Q4 to open 7 additional ones, 5 in the U.S. and 2 others internationally. And that would put us in a total of 21 net new warehouses for the fiscal year, 23 -- which included 2 relocations, so 21 net.  In addition to the 21 planned openings for fiscal '21, we are looking to open about 25 new units, net new units in each of the next 2 fiscal years, including a second warehouse in China in fiscal '22, which would be the end of -- towards the end of calendar '21 and a third expected to open in late calendar '22, which would be early fiscal year '23.  Regarding CapEx, the third quarter fiscal '21 spend was approximately $1.03 billion. Our full year CapEx spend is now estimated to be in the $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion range, increased a little from our estimate made 12 weeks earlier to include the recent $340 million purchase of a distribution facility on the West Coast to support our big and bulky delivery activities. Now going -- turning to e-commerce. Again, e-commerce sales in the third quarter ex FX increased 38.2% year-over-year. Stronger departments included jewelry, home furnishings, sporting goods, hardware and majors, which, of course, includes both everything from appliances to consumer electronics.  In terms of Costco Logistics and an update there, we anniversary-ed the purchase of Innovel, now called Costco Logistics this fiscal quarter. Costco Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales with the U.S. e-com sales on these items up 53% during the quarter.  Costco Logistics fulfilled about 70% of all U.S. big and bulky orders, and we also continue to add some new big and bulky vendors. Overall, we've improved delivery time on many items from up to 2 weeks to in many -- in several cases, now 5 to 7 days. As well, we've taken several items that were previously vendor-drop shipped that are now -- and are now being direct imported allowing us to not only speed up delivery but reduce prices to our members. From a supply chain perspective, port delays are continuing to have an impact. We are utilizing additional carriers, in some cases, to help alleviate some of that. Containers and pallets are also facing shortages anecdotally, 35% to 50% increase in incoming containers this year versus a year ago. Some of that's pent-up demand, but just from the low points a year ago. The turnaround of a container hitting the U.S., delivering its contents and being back at the U.S. port to head back overseas has gone from approximately 25 days to 50 days. So a combination of things in terms of delays.  Chips shortages are impacting many items from an inflation standpoint, some items more than others. And again, as I mentioned, with regard to containers and shipping, transportation costs have increased as well. Despite these issues, we continue to work to mitigate cost increases and supply chain delays in a variety of different ways as best we can. The biggest way we've handled supply chain delays is adjusted ordering and front-loading, if you will, orders of many items. And we think we've got that pretty well under control.  This will continue -- the feeling is that this will continue for the most part of this calendar year. We've had a lot of questions about inflation over the past few months. There have been and are a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing. Inflationary factors abound. These include higher labor costs, higher freight costs, higher transportation demand, along with the container shortage and port delays that I mentioned, increased demand in various product categories some shortages, various shortages of everything from chips to oils and chemical supplies by facilities hit by the Gulf freeze and storms and, in some cases, higher commodity prices.  Some inflationary sound bites, if you will. Price increases on items shipped across the ocean with suppliers paying up to double for containers and shipping. Price increases of pulp, paper goods, some things up 4% to 8%, plastic and resin increases from trash bags to plastic cups, plates, et cetera, and plastic wraps. Metals, aluminum foil, mid-single-digit cost increases also cans for sodas and other beverages. Higher import prices on cheeses, the combination of the product itself as well as some FX strength of some foreign currencies as well as freight, anywhere from 3% to 10% increases on certain apparel items, not all.  In terms of fresh, higher protein prices, for example, meat overall year-over-year is up 7%. Beef in the last month has been up as much as 20%. Some of that is due to feed labor and transportation costs as well as restocking some of the additional increased demand coming now from institutional needs as restaurants start to reopen. And the list could go on and on.  Now all this being said, I was asked back on our March 4 -- second quarter call. At what level we felt inflation was running overall at that time with our goods. I stated that our best guess was somewhere in the 1% to 1.5% range. As of today, we guess that overall price inflation at the selling level, and excluding our gasoline sales, would be estimated to be probably more in the 2.5% to 3.5% range. Some items are up more and some items, the sale prices haven't yet changed. And some items are even down a little bit. We think, again, we've done pretty well in terms of controlling that as best as we can, but the inflation pressures abound.  In terms of sampling and demos in the warehouse, as you all know, we eliminated our popular food sampling and demo activities in our warehouses last March at the onset of the pandemic. As various states opened and closed last summer and fall, we tried a few sampling events. A few single-serve items like cookies and crackers, take-out only, no cook to prepared sample items and a few enhanced talking demos such as items for display only.  I'm happy to report that over the next couple of weeks, we're beginning a phased return to full sampling. This will come in waves. The first wave of locations, about 170 of our 550-ish locations in the U.S. will be activated by the first week of June, with most of the remaining locations returning towards the near -- or towards the end of June. The first wave will actually determine how fast we roll out and what and when restrictions are lifted. I'm sure there will be a few states with unique restrictions as well.  Increased safety protocols are and will be in place, including all samples prepared behind plexiglass, prepared in smaller batches for better safety control and distribute it to members one at a time.  Food courts, same thing as well. I'm pleased to report that our food courts are also coming back over the next few weeks in a bigger way. Last March, again in 2020 as the pandemic took hold, we pared back menu basically to hotdogs and pizza and soda and smoothies, and we eliminated all seating, those takeout only. We began several weeks ago adding back tables and seating and -- at a handful of outdoor food courts in a few states.  Over the past few months, we've also added back a few more food items, including bringing back a new and improved churros, which will be at all U.S. locations by the 4th of July, and adding a high-end soft ice cream to replace our frozen yogurt.  And by June 7, we plan to have tables in seating back at most locations, but with more physical separation, tables of 4 instead of 6 and 8 and about half the seating capacity as we had before. Again, these are still subject to doing this in waves and see how it goes and subject to any additional state rules or restrictions in a few cases.  Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results. For the 4 weeks ending the Sunday, May 30, on next Thursday, June 4 after market closes. With that, I will open up to questions and answers, and I'll turn it back over to Sarah. Sarah? Operator : Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good afternoon. Richard, you outlined a variety of inflationary pressures that you're seeing in the business. How is this going to impact Costco's gross margin over the next couple of quarters? Costco tends to move more slowly with changing prices than others. Should we expect this to be a pressure point, especially as you lap a period of strong gross margin gain given the good sell-through last year? Richard Galanti : Well, I mean, we'll have -- of course, Michael, we'll have to wait and see. I mean, our view is, is that while historically, we want to be -- mitigate those increases and work with our vendors and try to be as efficient as possible to lower those pressure points, some of it will pass through, and some of it has passed through. From a competitive standpoint, our view is it has not really impacted our margins in any big way. Some of the inflationary pressures, some very simple examples might be things like our $4.99 rotisserie chicken and our $2.99 40-packet of water. Those have stayed the same, notwithstanding there's been some pressure on some cost components of these items. So those are already impacting our margins a little. And I don't -- I think overall, relative to competition, that's not going to be an impact -- a big impact of where we go margin-wise. Michael Lasser : Okay. My follow-up question is on the value of the Costco membership. Amazon is enhancing the value of its membership with more media content. Walmart continues to focus on the value of its membership offering. Do you think these factors are influencing the pricing power that Costco has to raise the fees associated with either the gold or executive membership? And do you feel like there has been a sharp increase in the value of a Costco membership over the last four years is that as you approach the normal cadence of when you would typically raise your fees, you could do it this time again? Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, look, we focus first on driving more value. And I would like to think that some of the benefits that we've had in terms of strong business over the last -- not only the last year with COVID, certainly, we've been helped by the fact that we've been deemed an essential business and the strength in fresh and food items has helped quite a bit as well and buying things for the home. But I think we've gained market share on top of that, and that's all about value. I mean, our model is -- our view is our model is intact as it relates to the best prices on the best quality goods and services. And certainly, our buying power keeps improving in that regard. We've added things as it relates to different forms of procuring the merchandise, whether it's in-store or a big increase like many people with e-commerce. Certainly, our acquisition of what's now called Costco Logistics has been a big boom for our -- we believe, for our sales strength and competitiveness in those areas. So we think from a value proposition standpoint, the value of what we offer our members keeps going up.  As it relates to fee increases, historically, we've done it about every five years, so we would expect now to start getting questions since this is a year before that, and our answer is pretty straightforward. We'll have to wait and see. But we certainly feel good about our competitive position. Michael Lasser : All right. Thank you so much and best of luck. Richard Galanti : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Hey, Richard, the core on core, I think, you said up 27. And I know you don't guide on this. I just want to ask maybe about the puts and the takes, if you talk about other categories that are higher margin that have yet to recover on the positive side. And then on the other side, the spoilage and some other things that helped you last year sort of come back. So just kind of think are there more good guys, the bad guy and just another way to think about the gross margin core on core going forward? Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, there's always different pieces to that equation. As I mentioned, one of the things that we mentioned over the last few quarters was particularly strong fresh foods margins with higher labor productivity and much lower products spoilage. While, again, we're still above where we were pre-COVID, it's come down a little from its peak a year ago in Q3, but still nonetheless better than historical numbers.  One of the things that I mentioned picked up was nonfood. Again, the strength that we've seen in nonfoods has continued. It really started in the summer when people buying things for their home. Outside of that, certainly, I would expect on an ancillary business, taking gas out of it for a minute because that goes up and down at -- with a lot of factors causing it who the heck knows. But at the end of the day, if you look at some of the other ancillary businesses, I would expect to see, of course, margin improvement with optical and hearing aid relative to a year ago, for sure, even in Q4.  Same thing with travel. Travel is coming back as we see on the news every night. Travel is coming back in a big way with the improvement with COVID as well as probably a lot of pent-up demand. And we're seeing that ourselves in our travel business. And that's a high-margin business, although a small piece of the total sales action for the company.  So I think, overall, we seem to figure out how to get there in different ways, even something like Costco Logistics that in the last three-or-so quarters, I pointed out, it was a 5 to 7 basis point hit to margin. It's finally -- anniversary-ed some of that, and hopefully, we'll start to show some improvement. But there's little things like that that might show you a little improvement in the future. So -- but overall, it gets back to our ability to price our goods to - for great value and being competitive and still hopefully improving the bottom line will continue. But we'll let you know each quarter. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Sorry about the noise, but one quick question on inflation. It sounds like maybe other retailers are raising prices, but you're just -- your prices are up and not letting them lag. So I guess you're seeing the demand staying healthy. Or are you seeing the environment just stay rationale all across the board, and that's allowing you to take pricing up sort of at the same time as the input costs go up? Richard Galanti : Well, look, I think, first of all, we look at what we can do with our own blinders on. There has been a lot of CPG companies, both in paper goods, soda pop that have announced increases. And many of them are sticking because we and other retailers are aware of the underlying costs associated with it. I think we -- I'd like to think we can do as good a job as any given our purchasing power and limited number of SKUs that can mitigate that as best we can. To the extent that those are happening, the fact that, on average, our competitors are taking those probably as fast as not a little faster than us is a positive. But we've taken some price increases on things that have gone up. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. Your line is open. Tracy Kogan : Hey, it's Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. I have a question about your customer -- the customers that you've gained over the past year during the pandemic. And I was wondering if you could talk about maybe the demographics of that customer and what the repeat purchases have looked like, and how their spending might differ from your core group of customers? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Right. What's -- I guess, most interesting is, other than from an age standpoint, being a demographic that's so -- the next young generation of Gen Z or millennials before that and Gen Y or whatever else, we're getting our share of them. We did see over the -- as COVID hit, there was, of course, a spike not only -- there was a big spike, a big increase with same-day fresh delivery in many -- in most cases, with us with our relationship with Instacart. And also doing ourselves two-day dry grocery and some other items. And again, anecdotally, we know that we garnered some additional members that way. On the 2-day, since that is done via mostly UPS, you may have -- we've gotten some members that are outside of our geographic market areas of physical warehouses, but not a big giant number. So overall, I think if anything, we've seen our continued strength of adding net new members to existing warehouses.  Certainly, opening new warehouses helps and perhaps getting a few related to the online next-day delivery of fresh and things like that. Beyond that, again, when we see who from -- again, from an age demographic, we're getting -- we think that we're getting our good share of younger people as we did in previous. That was -- historically, that was sometimes a concern of some on Wall Street. Is this for the older generation? And what we're finding is as long as we keep changing our product mix to gear towards our -- who the member is, and in our case, when you see what we've done with organics over the last 10 years or more now, and summer sporting equipment and you name it, we get our fair share of those people. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Charles Grom : Richard, inventory dollars were up about 27%, which is much higher than you guys currently run. Just curious if there's any pull forward of items. And I guess, how do you feel about the current -- the position right now? Richard Galanti : I think what's interesting is -- yes, it was a little lower last year because we were just being hit with it. And so while we were scurrying to get merchandise in, we would also -- if you recall, back in March and early April, as we were realizing like everybody else that this was going to last longer, we were starting to cut back where we could seasonal orders and might have reduced our patio furniture needs for the part of the summer season and some of our Halloween needs and Christmas needs. And then we found out that we needed it even more. So probably some of it has to do with the fact that it being a little lower. And then as what I talked to earlier in this call about front-loading and buying early, that's -- we are happy to have some extra inventory. We clearly have a lot of -- we have plenty of cash to do that. And certainly, the cost of buying forward a little bit on some of these things is de minimis relative to what we earn on our cash. Charles Grom : Okay. Great. That makes sense. And then just on the consumer. Curious what you're seeing over the past few weeks or maybe the past couple of months from a behavior perspective, both frequency in your clubs, basket sizes, particularly in states that are further along in the reopening process. Richard Galanti : Well, again, it's hard to figure all these out because so many things were happening particularly last year in April, May, June time frame. What we saw is the states that opened a little early, we started seeing a little bit more shopping frequency a little earlier like Texas and Florida, but not in a meaningful discernible way. Trend-wise, yes, but not like let's wait for that everywhere.  But even in states that have been a little bit more closed, I mean the U.S., in particular, has opened up quite a bit in the last 1 month, 1.5 months as evidenced by new CDC guidelines and I think the spring weather in general, and so -- and just the pent-up interest in doing that. So I think a lot of that's already in there. And in other countries, in Canada, there's still some -- for much of the last fiscal quarter, in about 38 of the 101 or 102 Costcos in Canada, one of the main provinces, there was limitations on -- we had to cordon off nonessential items or so nonfood items. We can only sell food and cleaning supplies and paper goods and health and beauty and the like. So -- but that's -- even that is, I think, in a big way pretty much over. Charles Grom : Okay. Great. And then just last one for me. COVID costs were down meaningfully here in the third quarter. I'd imagine relative to the $281 million that you booked in the fourth quarter last year, you'd expect them to come down a lot. Is that a fair assumption for 4Q? Richard Galanti : Yes. Yes, again, a big chunk of that is the $2 an hour premium, which has been eliminated. And again, mind you that there'll still be a chunk related to the $1 permanent -- mostly $1 permanent wage increase that we did. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Karen Short : Actually, just following up on that last question. So looking at your sales growth versus your SG&A growth and recognizing that within SG&A dollars, you did still have the $2 for part of the quarter, I mean, it's been -- it's a much wider gap than we've seen for a long time, like even kind of looking at pre-COVID. So I'm wondering if there's anything you could point to on that specifically, and how to think about that going forward. And then I had one other question. Richard Galanti : Sure. I think first and foremost, it's sales, strong sales. This is a business that we know the benefits -- the operating leverage we got when we could do a 7% comp instead of a 4 or 5, and enjoying the comps that we have now, that's the biggest single piece of it. If anything, in the quarter, health care cost probably a little higher because people weren't going for their regular doctor visits a year ago in the third quarter. And so that was probably a little bit of a hit. But more -- what offsets all those types of anecdotal things is strong sales and just a core labor costs. Karen Short : Okay. And then... Richard Galanti : Gas as well, taking gas inflation out of there would reduce that a little bit. Karen Short : Right. Okay. And then my second question or actually maybe 2 more, with respect to the membership fee, obviously, recognizing the value of membership fee to your members, how are you thinking about timeline on the next possible increase just because I think we did anniversary what would be the 5-year mark? Richard Galanti : No. Actually, the 5-year mark is next June. Karen Short : Okay. And so what's -- how are you thinking about that philosophically? Richard Galanti : Philosophically, I get to think about not thinking about it for several months. No, jokes aside, again, we feel good about our member loyalty. Needless to say, with our renewal rates, we feel very good about our competitive position. But there's -- we really haven't given a lot of thought yet. Karen Short : Okay. And then just my last question. In terms of e-com, obviously, you gave us a good percent of sales and the growth that doesn't include third party. Can you actually give us a number -- and can you just give us an update on where that stands when you include the third-party in food? Richard Galanti : Yes. I think it's -- my guess is it's probably not as impactful now. The third party, most particularly the same-day fresh delivery really peaked last, I want to say, May or April, late April. And where -- it was huge and, I mean, it was tenfold increase. And it's now probably halved, still huge relative to pre-pandemic. But -- so it's not as impactful as it was. So again, I think there are a couple of quarters where we had -- a couple of quarters ago, we had like an 86% comp in e-commerce.  And we said that if you added back the stuff that we don't put in there like same-day fresh since third parties come in and buy it in the warehouse and take it to you, that 86% -- that 85% or 86% was up towards 100%. If you just -- this is -- I'm shooting from the hip here, but if that was 15 percentage points, let's assume it's 5 to 8 percentage points, but certainly not 15. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. John Heinbockel : Richard, let me start, Costco Logistics, where are you guys now with capacity utilization? And where will you be when you add this new facility? And to the degree that costs are coming down, have you yet invested in price? Or are you investing more in delivery timetable, quickness of delivery? Richard Galanti : Well, we were proving -- not to say that we don't have a few complaints every day from someone that screwed something up. But at the end of the day, we're improving in a big way. We actually were aggressive on pricing immediately. It's kind of like when we went into a new country like France or Spain, we're pricing in low volume, less efficient departments like fresh as if we were doing a lot of volume. And so those are examples where it's hurting us to start with as it relates to -- we're going to price the goods or lower the price of a mattress or a furniture set delivery based on what we can do before we actually do it.  Now that's thankfully catching up for itself -- with itself. In terms of capacity, it has a lot of capacity. As I mentioned, right now, about 70% of our big and bulky is now delivered through Costco Logistics. Some of it was being delivered by third parties that we're doing fine, but now we're doing it ourselves. That business, as I mentioned, is continuing to grow very handily not only for us but industry-wide with furniture and things for the home, exercise equipment, TVs and the like. And we think that we have tremendous capacity available. What we bought was at a capacity of less than 50% of what it had been doing itself a few years before. But again, those aren't completely -- you can't completely compare those two. What we just bought was a huge facility and acreage that allow us to do more big and bulky and recognizing so many things come in from overseas in big and bulky, and it's again on the West Coast in California. And so it's going to help us continue to grow that business.  We think we have a lot of growth. Way before COVID and more big and bulky and everything else, recall in the U.S., what we saw over the last 5 years, I think it was 5 years ago, we said in just white goods when all we did was sell them in store, we did about $50 million. And the year pre-COVID, 3 years hence, we did about $750 million or something. We're well beyond that now, both natural growth as well as what COVID has done in terms of people buying things for the home and then us being able to become more competitive on pricing.  We've seen items, not across the board, but items where we've lowered the price by 10% and 15% or more, greatly improved the delivery time and are driving that business. John Heinbockel : And then just real quick, lastly, the cold and frozen delivery program, the 2-day program, how is that being fulfilled? And how do you think about that conceptually, right, in terms of consumer uptake versus the dry grocery that you did previously? Richard Galanti : It's really too early, John, to tell. We just started that 3 weeks ago, and something that our people in that operation wanted to try. And business centers, it's -- we think it's something that lends itself well to our business customer needs as well, and we'll see. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from R5 Capital. Scott Mushkin : So Richard, I actually wanted to get back at this big and bulky that we were talking about before. Kind of hoping you can maybe size the opportunity. Obviously, you guys are putting a lot of money into it. What kind of -- maybe you can give us like what percentage of your sales are in those items now, where do you think it's going to go. Like how much do you think you can drive sales? I was just wondering if you could do anything to size it because it's obviously a big focus for the company and a big capital investment. Richard Galanti : Yes. I don't have that detail in front of me. We're seeing 30% and 50% increases on items within some of those categories, everything from outdoor patio furniture or indoor furniture to mattresses to exercise equipment, the TVs along the way. Scott Mushkin : And is your expectation to bring in more vendors? And I don't know how many SKUs you're offering, but will you have more SKUs? And how are you thinking about advertising at your membership base? Richard Galanti : Well, yes, I mean, first of all, I think that when we look at our 3- to 5-year plan, we think there will be outsized growth certainly for the next 3-plus years, we'll see. In terms of adding SKUs, yes, but we're not going crazy. Certainly, there's more SKUs online furniture sets, sofa and chair sets. We might have 1 or 2 on display, sometimes, in a warehouse, we'll have a dozen or so online. So we are adding both vendor names as well as additional selection, but still greatly limited relative to the traditional retail of those items. Scott Mushkin : Perfect. And then my second question is something we've talked about all the time, and I could go at it again. It's just on the openings. I know you said 25 this year over '22 and 25 in '23, I guess. I mean obviously, our research suggests you guys could do a lot more. And I know we've talked about the, I guess, the hard thing of getting the right locations and everything else. But what would it take to get that to 30 to 35, again on a more permanent basis? And is that something you guys would kind of strive to do? Because clearly the market opportunity is there. Operator : This is the operator. I'm sorry. The line of the speaker got disconnected for a second. [Technical Difficulty]. Richard Galanti : Sorry about that. Scott, let's go back to your question. My apologies. Scott Mushkin : That's all right. So my question was, I don't know what -- did you guys hear any of my question or no? Richard Galanti : You can start again. Scott Mushkin : Okay. So basically, you said fiscal '22 and '23, 25 clubs and 25 clubs, we've talked about this a number of times about trying to get that number up. Obviously, the market opportunity is there. Can you beef up the real estate department? Like what's the -- what's holding you guys back to getting to 30 to 35? Again, because it looks like the opportunity is there to us with the research. Richard Galanti : Well, I think some other countries tend to be a little slower and challenged, but we have beefed it up. That's one of the reasons I think that I went out as far as I did by saying 25 in each of the next 2 years. We feel relatively confident that the -- all the items that we have in the fire right now, both U.S. and Canada as well as other parts of the world, we feel good about. We've got a lot of things going on.  Now going from 25 to 35, I'm not sure we're prepared to do that yet. Could we do it? Yes. But certainly, in some of the countries that are smaller, we like to go slow. And I mean, we picked up the pace in China by now having 2 ready either under construction or getting ready to be under construction and to open over the next 18 months. And for us, that's faster than we would have gone. And you'll see more announcements both there and elsewhere over the next few quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Erica Eiler : This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So first, I wanted to touch on your services business. As we look at travel and optical and food court, is there any way you can help us frame, at this point, how much of your service businesses have recovered versus 2019 levels? Richard Galanti : Well, there's a few different things. I mean if I look at travel, I think, in the last month, we probably had 10 of our top 15 days ever in our history, so even at holiday time in '19. Part of that, again, though, was the pent-up demand. So we'll see where it normalizes out. Right now, both car rentals, we also pivoted and added in addition to -- while cruises are still down, they're being booked again now, but still down.  We did a big push starting several months ago to negotiate and offer some great deals on other, what I'll call, U.S., Mexico and Hawaii-type trips -- vacation trips.  Yes. So bookings, they're not revenue yet, but bookings are particularly strong now. And hearing aid, you had a little bit of the same issue when they were essentially closed down because of direct one-to-one contact, when you're getting fitted for a hearing aid. There was a lot of pent-up demand that we've seen and we continue to see, the same with optical. We think that will continue to be normalized, but we'll have to wait and see.  Food courts is probably going to take another several months. Having tables out there will help, expanding the menu will help. And of course, pharmacy didn't really ever see a big dramatic downturn. Erica Eiler : Okay. Great. And then your food categories have held up really well in spite of lapping the difficult comparisons last year. So maybe just an update on how you're thinking about food-at-home consumption from here. Richard Galanti : Well, I mean, our 40,000-foot view of that is that what was gained because of food away from home stopping a year ago, and while it picked up some with takeout and delivery, it's now starting to improve a little bit, but some of that's going to be sticky. I don't know what the exact number is going to be, but our view is, is that it still certainly hasn't reverted back.  I mean restaurants are just beginning to open in a bigger way. In many cases, still people are reluctant to go in. In many cases, the tables are further separated. So some of that's going to continue for the next 6-plus months, is my guess. Beyond that, when all is said and done, will some of it still be sticky? Our view is probably the fact that we, as a company, have done a pretty good job of staying in stock and certainly the quality of our fresh foods, I think that we've not only benefited from that. I'd like to think that we gain market share from other traditional food retailers in that regard, particularly on the fresh side. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Richard, first, just wanted to ask about executive membership, the penetration, I guess, up over $800,000 this quarter. This is high as I can see it in our model here. Just was curious if that's still happening in a meaningful way in the U.S.? Or if there's any other countries? And just any color you can provide on that point. Richard Galanti : I think the one factor that was a little a bit of an anomaly is as we -- just in the last year, we expanded executive membership to Japan where we have 29 locations, 28 locations -- 29 locations, and including 2 new Japan locations this quarter. And as a company, I think, overall, we continue to get better at signing people up as executive members, telling them what the virtue of it is and doing a better job of having a higher percentage of every 100 new members that sign up as well as converting. I think within that 817,000 something just under 200,000 was Japan. So even taking that out, I think it was 180-something thousand. So even taking that out, the 6 30 or 40 pluses, it was still a very strong number for the quarter outside of that. Kelly Bania : Okay. That's helpful. And then just any update on the pickup test that's happening? Richard Galanti : It's still a test. We're still just doing it in New Mexico in 3 locations. And the utilization of it, when we first did it, we marketed a little bit. The utilization has not set the world on fire in terms of where it's trending. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Loop Capital. Laura Champine : So Richard, you mentioned the negative impact on renewals from the Chinese store lapping. Are they renewing at about the same pace that you would normally expect first year renewals relative to prior store openings in new geographies? Richard Galanti : One of the unique things, if I go back over the last 15 years when we've opened in new countries, you have outsized new sign-ups and, frankly, probably some that are just lucky of us. And so you have a lower-than-average renewal rate to start with. When I look back at the 7 or 8 countries outside of the U.S. and Canada, I mean, there's 10 or so, but what we've seen is that instead of -- in the U.S. or Canada, we might add anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 members in the first year, recognizing in some of these are existing markets. So you've got people shopping more often because they're closer to the new opening.  We've enjoyed in Korea, Taiwan, Japan and even more so in China 50,000 to 100,000 new member sign-ups when we open up. And then a year later, 1.5 years later, when they're renewing -- when that first batch is renewing for the first time to get to that 88-plus worldwide renewal rate and the 90.1 in the U.S. and Canada, it starts off, it could be anywhere from the high 50s to the mid-60s in that first year. And I don't have in front of me what China is. But China is also outsized in that regard. I think we have close to 400,000 members in that 1 location. Remind you, it's a very large city and Costco entered as a well-known entity, notwithstanding the fact that it was our first one. So for all those reasons, it alone affected that worldwide renewal rate. We're not surprised. And by the way, even whatever renewals, nonrenewals we've been -- that have been incurred, we've gotten more than that in terms of new sign-ups. I think at the end of about 3 months after we opened in China, which was August of '19, we had around 300,000 members, and I think now we have about 400,000. So even if we've lost a bunch, we've gained a bunch plus some more. Laura Champine : Understood. And then secondly, on the roughly 30 basis points decline in core margins on an ex gas basis, you mentioned that that is related in part to the sales shift back to lower-margin ancillary business. Was this the quarter where you're lapping the most extreme move away from ancillary? Or is it -- are we likely to see a similar impact as we move through the year? Richard Galanti : I think Q3 was probably the most. It will still be impactful in Q4, probably not as much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Gregory Melich : Two questions. First on e-commerce and multichannel. Do you have an update on the penetration now for e-commerce? Is it 10% or close? And what are you seeing in terms of the percentage of members that use multichannel and what their renewal rates look like, if they're any different? Richard Galanti : First of all, I think it's about 7.5 or 8, and part of that is the huge shrink in gas. Gregory Melich : Got it. Richard Galanti : And what was the other part of the question, Greg? Gregory Melich : The other part of that was just for people that -- like what percentage of members actually use multichannel offering? Like used either 2-day or Instacart, is it majority that have used it? And then what do their renewals look like once they've used you in multiple channels? Richard Galanti : Somewhere around 45% of our members have used e-commerce. And the renewal rate is slightly better. I'm not talking about new members that signed up that have just used e-commerce, I'm talking about just how many people -- how many existing members have used e-commerce. Gregory Melich : Got it. No, that's great. And then the second question was on gasoline, I just want to make sure I got this right. Do you have a number for what the gallons growth was? And a penny profit was up or down. I think -- I know it hurts the mix, but just where we are in that cycle right now with gas inflation? Richard Galanti : Gas dollar profits were down because we had a -- it was interesting. Notwithstanding the fact that -- well, if you think back again in the third quarter last year, it was mid-February effectively to mid-May. The first 4 -- 3 to 4 weeks of that, there was a frenzy. It was either pre-COVID or the frenzy of people hoarding and everything. So gas was pretty strong in those first few weeks. Then it plummeted and -- but not withstanding the fact that it plummeted, pricing was less competitive. So we had a very strong P&L, as I think I'm sure I mentioned last year in the quarter, it was particularly strong. We had a fine gas profit this quarter. But last year was fine with a capital F. Gregory Melich : Got it. And so the pressure on any penny profit that you can get when gallons are recovering, I mean gallons are recovering now. Are we at that stage? Richard Galanti : Yes, very much so. Gregory Melich : Okay. And what's -- do you have a number that you can give us in the quarter? Richard Galanti : I have one I cannot give you. No, I can't. Gas has been -- for those of you who've known us for many years, gas used to be a business that, on a given day or week, on a fully allocated P&L, could actually lose a little or all the way to make a lot. And it would be very volatile. In a matter of a week or 2, it could switch from the top to the bottom there.  The normal over the last few years has been it is a profitable business, and there's still some outlying big profitable days and a lot more days that are just regularly profitable. But the fact that it's coming up and the fact that it is probably overall a little less competitive out there, but that's not just in the last few weeks, that's been over the last year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : I want to know, do you have any data you can share about the demographics or income levels of the new members that you've picked up in the past year? Is it trending any differently than your typical new member growth? Is it younger? I think Tracy kind of asked this question already, but I wonder if you had any specifics.  And then lastly, I wanted to know, do you think you've got any benefit this quarter from consumers having just more money in their pocket from stimulus payments? Or is that not really characteristic of your membership? Richard Galanti : I don't have any economic average income demographics in front of me. I know when we look at new member sign-ups currently versus a year ago versus 2 and 3 years ago, we still are getting our share of younger people maybe a little younger than that right now simply because of e-com and what have you has helped a little bit on that area, but nothing discernibly different.  As it relates to where we helped -- when we've looked at things in the past as it relates to some unusual stimulus, our view is we haven't seen as big a benefit as some of the other discounters or general merchandise discounters have seen. But it can't hurt. So my guess is it certainly it's probably helped us some, but not as much as others. Robert Moskow : It probably helped a little, not a lot. Okay. Richard Galanti : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict from Baird. Peter Benedict : Richard, first question, just given the sourcing challenges around the pandemic, I'm just curious, any updated thoughts you have on your vertical sourcing initiatives? Anything being sped up or slowed down? Just what's your -- what's the latest update on that? Richard Galanti : Yes. Well, look, I mean, in a big way, I think the fact that we've got 2 meat plants and a chicken plant and a bakery commissary and a couple of optical grinding labs, if anything, those things have helped us a little bit. They're at full production in a big way. When feed costs go up -- in the chicken plant, for example, we go out somewhat with feed costs, but I'm sure we don't hedge ourselves completely in either directions, but we've done a pretty good job of managing those costs. Yes, go ahead -- but nothing major there. And then what was the other question? Peter Benedict : No. Yes, I was just wondering if you accelerated any initiatives that you maybe had in the pipeline, given what you've seen in COVID? Or if there's been any maybe new areas of the business that you maybe weren't considering vertical before, but maybe now you are? Richard Galanti : Yes. I think the big one that has -- again, that has surprised us in the sense that we think there's lots of opportunity there is the whole Costco Logistics side. For a variety of reasons, not only handling it ourselves and controlling the destiny of delivery times. But actually, there's a number of items that we historically have drop-shipped, if you will. The supplier carries the inventory, the supplier sends it and, needless to say, there's a cost associated with that. As we get bigger and higher volume and do some of those things direct, we're able to basically improve the delivery time and lower the price, and we've seen that.  And then we're getting better at insulation. That's something that we will continue to improve on as well. So I think that's probably the one area. I don't -- there's nothing currently planned in terms of the next big chicken plant, if you will. There's going to still be significant money spent on fulfillment, in distribution and logistics, as I just mentioned earlier about our CapEx. Beyond that, there was one other thing I was going to mention, which I can't remember now. Why don't we take two more questions. Peter Benedict : No worries. Richard, just one follow-up on self-checkout, that effort you have. How penetrated is that across the chain right now? And what's been the member feedback? Are you guys pleased with the service you're giving there? Obviously, volumes are really high through the club, so I'm just curious on that. Richard Galanti : Self-checkout works. It's in 90-plus percent of our warehouses. I've seen locations where we started with 6, 2 stacks of 3, and now we're at 9 and 12 in a couple of locations. So it's working. Certainly, the customer likes it. And it improves the frontline and service. So -- and it's cost efficient. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Jacob Chinitz : This is Jake Chinitz on for Scott. I know you've done a couple of things to stay more in touch with members, especially on the e-commerce side, for example, building a database of updated member e-mails. So can you just give us an update where that may be from a progression standpoint? And any results you've seen from that? Richard Galanti : Well, I think we're improving and a lot of the improvement we're doing in terms of a better mobile site and is -- and better service to our members, and ability to communicate to our members. Hold on 1 second here. In the last quarter -- I'm sorry, the last year, we've gone -- we've increased the number of e-mailable addresses by 24%. And we're seeing higher conversion rates, as I mentioned already. And we're doing more things in the warehouse with -- to drive traffic online as well. So I think all those things are working, and we'll continue to improve our mobile. I'll make a point on the next earnings call to talk about -- I mentioned on Q2 earnings call, there were kind of like 3 phases of upgrades to our mobile site starting in September and then over the next 6-or-so months after that. I'll make a point of pointing some of those things out. Recognizing some of those things others have been doing, and we're just getting around to do.  Why don't we take one more question and that will be it? Operator : Your last question, sir, comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : Just first one for you, Richard, on timing and next openings in China. Any more detail on when that next door is going to open? And then you talked about good news coming on pace of maybe opening beyond that. Thoughts on the potential to accelerate there now that you've had that first store open for a while? Richard Galanti : Well, yes. I mean our view originally was we'd open 1, and even before that opening, we -- where would be 5 years hence, maybe we'd have 3. And my guess is today, we'll shoot for a number a little bigger than that, maybe 4 or 5. But there's a lot of -- there's a few irons in the fire over there, but those are the 2 that are signed, sealed and under construction. Edward Kelly : And the next opening, when is that scheduled for? Richard Galanti : I believe the fall -- hold on a second. Late next summer. Unidentified Company Representative : Calendar '22. Richard Galanti : Yes, calendar '22, which would be Q1 of '23. Edward Kelly : And then just one for -- on your business customer. Just remind us of your business customer mix. And then what are you seeing in that customer as things start to recover? Do you think there's any permanent damage to that business at all? Or do you expect it to just sort of come back with reopen? Richard Galanti : Look, there's fewer businesses. I mean yes, I think one of the things that recognize this change over our 37 years or so in business, if you go back in the first few years, it was probably 75-25 or 80-20 business to consumer. And consumers were buying a lot of institutional business items. Today, arguably while we're still a wholesaler and, certainly, business members are important to us, it's probably 75-25 the other way, 75 consumer. And recognize one of the reasons we've done our business center is to focus more on that as well. In fact, I think all 3 openings in Canada this coming quarter or this past quarter, are business centers. And our deliveries are starting to come back.  Look, at the end of the day, I don't have the statistics in front of me, but if there were -- for every 100 small restaurants, be it a food truck or takeout or ethnic, I don't know how many of them closed, probably not a lot, but was it 10 or 20, I don't know. And the others are coming back. So there's probably a little bit of detriment there. And as I mentioned earlier, though, our view is that we think some of the business, not just in the food area, will be sticky to us as well. Operator : There are no question at this time. Sir, you may continue. Richard Galanti : I would like to just say one last thing. At the end of the call before opening it to Q&A, I mentioned that our May sales release for the 4 weeks ending May 30 would be on Thursday, June 4. It's actually Thursday, June 3. So thanks for that correction. Thank you, everyone, and have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker for today, Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. Thank you. Please go ahead. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Anne, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.  The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the 16 weeks ended August 29th. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.67 billion or $3.76 per share. Last year's fourth-quarter net income came in at 1.389 billion or $3.13 per diluted share. This year's fourth quarter included an $84 million pre-tax or $0.14 a share charge for the write-off of certain IT assets.  Last year's fourth quarter included a $281 million pre-tax charge or $0.47 a share of COVID -related costs. As well, it included a $36 million or $0.06 a share pre-tax charge related to the prepayment of $1.5 billion of debt partially offset by an $84 million or $0.15 per share benefit -- per share benefit for the partial reversal of a reserve related to a product tax assessment taken in the fiscal year 2019.  Net sales for the quarter increased 17.5% to $61.44 billion, up from $52.28 billion a year earlier in the fourth quarter. Comparable sales for the fourth quarter as reported an hour ago, for the 16 weeks on a reported basis, U.S. was 14.9%, excluding gas inflation and FX, the 14.9 would be 10.3% positive. Canada reported 19.5% plus, ex-gas inflation and FX 6.7%. Other international reported 15%, without gas inflation and FX 7.3%. Total Company 15.5% reported 9.4% ex-gas inflation and FX. E-commerce, by the way, reported was 11.2% positive, ex-gas inflation, and FX 8.9%. In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 9.2% worldwide and 8.8% in the US.  Our average transaction or basket was up 5.8% worldwide and 5.6% in the U.S. during the fourth quarter, that -- those numbers, including the positive impact from gas inflation and FX. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impact sales by approximately 230 basis points, whereas gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 385 basis points.  Moving down the income statement to the membership line, membership fee income for the fourth quarter came in at $1.234 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. That's up $128 million from the prior year's fourth quarter membership fee income of 1.106 billion; the $128 million represents an 11.7% increase year-over-year, excluding the benefit from positive FX the $128 million positive number would've been a $107 million positive or a 9.7% effective increase. In terms of renewal rates at the fourth quarter end, our U.S. and Canada, renewal rate was 91.3% up 3/10 of a percentage point from 16 weeks earlier number in Q3 end. The worldwide renewal rate came in at 88.7%, also up 3/10 of a percentage point from Q3 and 16 weeks earlier.  Renewal rates are benefiting, we believe, for more members auto-renewing, as well as increased penetration of executive members who, on average, renew at a higher rate than non-executive members. Our first-year renewal rates have also improved as well during this time. In terms of the number of members at Q4 end member households and total cardholders, at Q4 fiscal year-end a few weeks ago, total paid households were 61.7 million.  That's up 1.1 million from the $60.6 million figure we shared with you 16 weeks earlier. Total cardholders came in at 111.6 million or 1.8 million higher than the 109.8 we had as of Q3 end. At Q4 end paid executive members were -- came in at 25.6 million, an increase of a little over a million new executive members. And that's during the 16-week period, as well. Moving down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was lower year-over-year by 32 basis points, and actually excluding gas deflation, it was higher by 5 basis points.  As I usually do, I ask you to jot down two columns of numbers, a little gross margin matrix if you will. The line items will be core merchandise, ancillary -- second line item would be ancillary and other businesses, third line item would be 2% reward, fourth line item would be lifo, and last line item would be other, and then finally, the last line item would be total.  Two columns, the first one being reported year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and the second column, excluding gas inflation. So, core merchandise on a reported basis was lower year-over-year by 90 basis points, ex-gas inflation was lower minus 57 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses plus 44 on a reported basis, and plus 53 ex-gas inflation. 2% reward plus 1 basis point and minus 3 year-over-year on a report -- on ex-gas inflation.  Lifo minus 5 and minus 5 basis points, and other plus 18 and plus 17. If you add up the 2 columns, you get the total for reported, the 32 basis points as I just mentioned, and again, ex-gas inflation plus 5 basis points. Now the core merchandise component you see here are lower by 90 year-over-year and lower by 57 ex-gas inflation. Similar to last quarters is primarily a function of sales shifting from core to ancillary versus the last year as we begin to revert back to more historical sales penetrations. Recall last year we saw a significant shift of sales out of the ancillary and other businesses and into the quarter.  In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the fourth quarter, the core on core margins were lower by 40 basis points with non-foods slightly up, food and sundries are slightly lower year-over-year. Fresh foods was down and was the fundamental driver of the core on core being lower in the quarter. Now fresh foods are lapping exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outsized sales a year ago in Q4. We retained some of that productivity gains -- from those productivity gains as volumes have remained high. However, we've also elected to hold, delay and/or mitigate some of the price increases in this increasingly inflationary environment over the last few months. Ancillary and other business gross margin, as you've seen the chart -- in the matrix was higher by 44 basis points and higher by 53 ex-gas inflation in the quarter.  Gasoline had a good quarter, as we are lapping year-over-year, a softer quarter due to the pandemic. We also showed improvement in a food court, optical, travel, all of which were benefited by easy compares versus last year, also due to the impacts of COVID on those businesses. Now LIFO, this is a gross margin charge that we haven't seen in this matrix for about 7 years, LIFO was lower by 5 basis points, both with and without gas inflation.  We had a $30 million LIFO charge in the quarter, the first such charge since 2014. This is a result of the continued inflationary cost pressures, which I will discuss more in a few minutes. 2% reward, higher by 1 basis point on a reported basis, but more importantly, lower by 3 basis points ex-gas inflation.  Again, implying the slightly higher penetration of sales going to the executive member and the associated rewards would become with it. And other is up 18 basis points and then up 17 ex-gas inflation. This is primarily related to COVID-related costs from a year ago. Moving to SG&A our reported SG&A in the fourth quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 45 basis points and lower or better by 13 basis points, excluding gas inflation.  The second matrix of the day, the two columns reported an ex-gas inflation and five-line items -- operations, second line items central, third-line-item stock compensation, fourth line item other, and then total, on a reported basis, core operations was lower or better by plus 19 basis points and ex-gas inflation higher by 8 basis points or minus 8 basis points. Central plus 12 and plus 8. Stock compensation, plus 2 and plus 2.  And other plus 12 and plus 11. Adding up the columns, again, SG&A on a reported basis was better or lower by 45 basis points and lower ex gas inflation by 13. As you can see in the matrix, the core operations component again was better by 19 and low -- and higher by -- lower by 19 and then -- or higher by 8 excluding the impact from gas inflation.  Keep in mind these results include the permanent $1 an hour wage increase that we implemented in March of this year. This higher by bate -- by 8 basis point year-over-year expense result, it includes the 14-basis point cost of the dollar an hour wage increase. Central again, improved by 8 basis point ex-gas inflation and stock compensation also with strong sales and helped by 2 basis points.  Now the other of plus 12, or plus 11 without gas inflation, so lower. That was the number of basis points, included in other last year was the COVID expense of $217 million or 42 basis points and the reversal of a product tax assessment reserve of $84 million or 16 basis points. This year includes the write-off of the IT assets, totaling $84 million or 14 basis points. So, you add all those up, that's where you get the 11. Next on the income statement is pre-opening. Pre-opening this year was $35 million. Last year, $26 million, so higher by 9. Pre-opening is up year-over-year, in part due to the timing of openings. And given different amounts of pre-opening on a given location, both within the quarter and the following quarter.  All told reported operating income in the fourth quarter increased by 18% coming in at $2.275 billion this year compared to $1.929 billion a year earlier. Below the operating income line, interest expense was 52 million this year, essentially the same as 51 million a year ago. Interest income and others for the quarter were higher by $77 million year-over-year. Roughly half of that is due to favorable FX, and the other half is related to last year's fourth-quarter charge for the make-whole debt prepayment. Overall reported pre-tax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021, came in up 23% coming in at 2.291 billion, compared to last year's 1.869 billion. Now, our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 26.1%, higher than last year's fourth-quarter rate of 24.9. For Fiscal '22, based on our current estimates, which of course can always change, we anticipate that our effective normalized total Company tax rate to be similar to Fiscal '21, somewhere in the 26% to 27% range.  Unless of course there are changes to the U.S. corporate tax rates, we'll have to wait and see. A few other items of note, warehouse expansion for the Fiscal '21 which just ended, we opened a net opening of 20, and we actually had 22 openings including two relocations, but a total increase of 20 net units.  This year, we're looking to open at least 25 net new units, including second warehouses in each of China and France, and our first location in New Zealand. As well, we plan to relocate five locations. R regarding capital expenditures, our fourth quarter 2021 spend capital expenditure was approximately 1.09 billion.  Our full-year capital spend was 3.59 billion. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, this included a relatively recent $340 million purchase of a distribution filler -- a distribution facility on the West Coast to support our big and bulky delivery activities. For E-commerce, E-commerce sales in the fourth quarter, ex - Fx increased by 8.9% year-over-year, that's on top of last year's Q4 E-commerce sales increase of 91%. Stronger departments, Jewelry, we actually sold a couple of rings in the $100,000 range.  Home Furnishings was strong, Pharmacy was strong, and Sporting Goods was strong. A couple of other large departments like Majors and Electronics, while very good sales, we had really outsized sales a year ago, in the fourth quarter, during COVID. Update on Costco Logistics.  Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales. For the quarter, Costco Logistics sales within our delivery were up 130%. And in the quarter represented 24% of all sales on our U.S. E-commerce site. That compares to -- that 24% compares to the 11% of e-commerce sales last year. Mind you, much of that relates to moving things from other third parties to our own internal logistics department.  Approximately -- currently approximately seven to 10 thousand daily deliveries via Costco logistics are occurring and continuing to grow. In terms of our e-com app, we have over 10 million downloads. It's continually improving with additional features coming soon. Digital payment using the Costco credit card it's in pilot in several locations with the full route with full rollout by the middle of next month.  The ability to view warehouse receipts online, also next month. More detail on online purchases as well. And by October end, we -- an improved mobile site, improved look and feel, a new landing page, and expanded information both for dot-com use and for enhanced warehouse information.  From a supply chain perspective -- I want to go back to two things supply chain and inflation. From a supply chain perspective, the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container shortages, COVID disruptions, shortages on various components, raw materials, and ingredients; labor cost pressures, and trucker and driver shortages -- truck and driver services.  Domestically, anecdotally rather from an -- even on a domestic side, various major brands are requesting longer lead times. In some cases, difficulty in finding drivers in trucks on short notice, lead times on ingredients and packaging have been extended in some cases.  So planning is crucial, which I feel people have done a great job that over the last several months. Also, we're putting some limitations on key items like bath tissues, roll towels, signature water, high-demand cleaning-related skews related to the uptick in adults-related demand. Furniture delays in some shortages across traditional rollout times to go from 8 to 12 weeks up to 16 to 18 weeks.  In some ways, we think that's an advantage. We're selling out the -- generally, merchandise wins once it's received within two weeks on most items and we've ordered more and earlier. The same thing with toys and Christmas, we're bringing in some of the items early. Chip shortage impacting many items, as I mentioned in the last call, examples of impacted items, computers, tablets, video games, major appliances. The feeling is from the buyers as this will likely extend into 2022.  Again, we're ordering as much as we can and getting in earlier. And I think as evidenced by most recent sales results, we're doing okay with this. Despite these issues -- sorry. In terms of transportation costs, they're increasing were reading about it every day. Containers, trucks, and drivers all are impacting the timing of deliveries and higher freight costs. Despite all these issues, we continue to work to mitigate cost increases in a variety of different ways and hold down and/or mitigate our price increases passed onto the members.  We've also chartered 3 ocean vessels for the next year to transport containers between Asia and the U.S. and Canada, and we've leased several thousand containers for use on these ships. Every ship can carry 800 to 1,000 containers at a time and we'll make approximately 10 deliveries during the course of the next year. Moving to inflation, again, there have been many -- there have been and are a variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing and -- more of it. As I discussed on last quarter's call, inflationary factors abound, higher labor costs, higher freight cost, higher transportation demand, along with container shortages and port delays, increased demand in certain product categories.  Various shortages of everything from computer chips to oils and chemicals, at higher commodities prices. That's a lot of fun right now. Some inflationary soundbites, if you will, price increases on items shipped across the oceans. Some suppliers are -- that's paying 2-6 times for containers and shipping. Price increases of pulp and paper goods, some items up 4% to 8%.  Again, we're trying to mitigate those where we can and we think we've done a decent job of mitigating some of it. Plastics, resin increases on things like dressed trash bags, Ziplock skews, pet products include -- resin oriented pet products, plastic cups, plates, plastic wrap, many items up in the 5% to 11% range. Metals, again aluminum foil, mid-single-digit crossed increases as well as cans for sodas and other beverages. I mentioned commodities earlier, oil, coffee, nuts, they remain generally, according to our buyers at 5-year highs, and so on. Higher import prices on things from Europe, like cheeses, but the combination of freight and FX. 3% to 10% increases on certain but not all apparel items. And fresh foods inflation is up in the mid to high single-digits, with meat leading the way up high -- single to low double-digits due to the feed, labor, and transportation costs. Now, I was asked back in March at our Second Quarter Earnings Call at what level we felt inflation was running overall on the sale price side. I stated that our best guess at the time was somewhere between 1% and 1.5%. I updated that 16 weeks earlier -- 16 weeks ago on our May 26 Third Quarter Call and we opted for the estimate to be in the 2.5% to 3.5% range. As of today, in talking with our senior merchants, we would estimate the overall price inflation of the products we're selling to be in the 3.5% to 4.5% range.  As I discussed earlier, this inflation was the driver of the $30 million LIFO charge that we took in the quarter. But all of this said, I feel -- I feel very good with the job that our merchants, our Traffic department and our operators have all been doing enable to -- in order to get the products that we need, pivot when and where necessary, and keep our warehouses full while keeping prices as low as we can for our members and continuing to show incredible value versus our competitors. I think this is reflected in our strong reported sales and profits that we've achieved, despite challenges and our typical aggressive pricing. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the 5 weeks ending September, Sunday, October 3rd, on Wednesday, October 6th, after the market close. And with that, I will open it up for questions with Anne. Anne? Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We have our first question from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simeon Gutman : Hey, Richard. My first question is on the next fiscal year. I know you don't give a lot in terms of guidance, but wanted to ask if you think or how should we think about EBIT, whether it grows or not next year? And if you don't answer that, I was going to ask if comps grow in Fiscal '22 should EBIT grow? Richard Galanti : Well on the first question, of course, I can't say we don't provide guidance, but we've always talked about being a top-line company and that helps a lot of things. So, depending on what level of sales, we'll have to wait and see. We do have the dollar increases started in March, that will anniversary next February.  So, at the end of Q2, next year. But again, we've shown that even with what we view as holding the line as much as we can on pricing and being pretty aggressive there and taking that into account, we've shown that with strong sales, we can certainly improve the bottom line as well, so fingers crossed. Simeon Gutman : So, my follow-up may be two parts and one of them is on sales and then you mentioned the wage increase. So, on the sales side, is there anything that you're looking at or approaching differently? I know extreme value is one angle, but the timing of mailers, inventory availability looking better, is it ancillary than hasn't recovered. What can you do on the top line given how big of a lap?  And then you mentioned the wage increases, and I know you'll lap those in March, but you've seen that Amazon and Walmart have moved up, and so I'm curious how do you think about, or should we expect another increase in terms of wages? Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, first of all, as it relates to all the anecdotal comments I made about supply chain and inflation, I think overall we feel that we're doing a heck of a job in that stuff. And I think some of the advantages we have is that we certainly have the financial ability to bring in things early or to order early and to mitigate whatever delay may have occurred. We certainly have the space to keep some of this stuff, most particularly because of our Costco Logistics acquisition a year ago, two additional storage space if you will. Not that we're having an issue with that because it's turning pretty fast, and the fact that we're able to pivot, we are bringing in new items. We're bringing in items off-season for Christmas, not -- pre - COVID it was toys, and trim at home, and electronics. Today it's all those things, plus things for the house, from barbecue grills, even summer items. But anything you can get your hands on. And again, I think we've done a very good job of adding suppliers where we can, and also making sure we're coming up with new items and being creative and innovative, even on the food and sundries side.  So, I think from that standpoint, despite sometimes looking at each other, the merchants and the traffic people never need to say, boy, when this is going to end? The fact is, I think we're doing a very good job with that. So, from an inventory standpoint, for those of you who several of you do go and visit our locations on a random basis, they're full, they look good compared to some of the pictures we see from others sometimes.  And so, I feel from that standpoint, we have a good issue. With inflation, to the extent that there are permanent inflationary items, like freight costs, or even somewhat permanent for the next year, we can't hold on to all those, some of that has to be passed on and it is being passed on. We're pragmatic about it, but we recognize that since things have been so successful and our sales have been strong, we can hold the line on some of those things and do a little better job, hopefully, do a better job than some of our competitors have, and be even that more extreme in the value. So, I think, all those things, so far, at least despite the challenges have worked in our favor a little bit. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks, Richard. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS, your line is now open. Michael Lasser : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question, Richard. In the past, what you\u2019ve said is that Costco's profitability tends to draft up the profitability of the overall retail sector. In the last year-and-a-half, the profitability of the overall retail sector has moved nicely higher. Also, Costco's profitability, its margins have moved nicely higher. Do you view this as sustainable? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, let me finish, Simeon had one other question on wages, and let me just respond to that. Look, we're known for always being one of the best wage packages and benefits packages and take care of our employee\u2019s package out there in big retail and big boxes, and all forms of big retail.  And even if - we raised our lowest, our starting wage to that 16 and 16.50 of late, mind you, our average hourly wage in the U.S. is slightly north of 24, with a very healthy employee benefit plan. We will do whatever it takes to continue to that -- that model. Who knows when and where, but we feel pretty good about where we are. And but as many of you on the call know, irrespective of what's going on with our Company in terms of strong sales or weak sales, we will do what's right by our employees. And Michael, I'm sorry, can I go back to your question? Michael Lasser : Yeah. The question was, we've seen an improvement in profitability across retail and that tends to influence the profitability or profit margins of Costco. Do you view this improvement to your profit margin as sustainable from here? Richard Galanti : Okay. Well look, I think the anomaly over the last year-and-a-half has been that when a lot of big boxes or big retailers were enjoying comps pre-COVID in the -- I'll call it the two to 4% range of the two to 5% range, and we're enjoying 5, 6s, 7s, now we've been enjoying mid-teens or effectively low-to-mid teens over, and we've taken some market share from others.  We think that some of that will stick, and we hope it will stick, and we feel pretty good right now about what we've done and what we've accomplished. To the extent that we can generate greater than industry average comps. I think - and there - they don't have to be in the low-to-mid teens, they could still be in the mid-to-high singles that we could -- should continue to improve. But I guess I get back to the comment that has been reinforced internally from the beginning of time, we are a top-line Company and everything else will take care of itself. Michael Lasser : Got it. My second questions on your gross margin. There's a lot of moving pieces, as there are a lot of moving pieces with everything that's happening with Costco right now, but specifically, you're giving back some of the core-on-core gross margin gains that you experienced some really strong price sales last year. But on the other hand, your ancillary businesses are doing really well.  So, is that dynamic where you're making up for the pressure on the fresh with strong ancillary, is that sustainable? And as part of that, the perception is that Costco tends to raise prices at a slower rate than others in the retail landscape, which tends to pressure its margins as inflation is heating up. What would be different this time to make that not happen? Thank you. Richard Galanti : I think -- your first part of your question, I think tells part of the tale is there are so many moving parts. If you look at gasoline, which is an - it is 10%+ of our sales. It's a huge business that can have huge variations of gross margin.  Knock-on-wood, always profitable, but it's still quite a range of gross margin. And that's more reflective of what's going on with competition in the retail gasoline market. We feel that sometimes other large retailers of gasoline, are looking to make a little more, which gives us the ability to be quite profitable but still show even bigger savings.  So, there are lots of puts and takes. Certainly, from last year, you had roughly a 16-week period, where our Optical and our Hearing Aid Centers were outright closed. Travel went to literally having negative revenue because it was not having a new business and it was refunding previously booked business at the trough of COVID, and so there's that kind of anomalies. Again, I get back to thinking that due to the unfortunate thing called COVID, some businesses have benefited in the sense that we were essential, in the sense that our [cavernous] (ph) places like we feel that people felt comfortable coming in to the extent that we are able merchandise-wise to have pivoted and maintain notwithstanding supply chain issues, maintain exciting full warehouses of merchandise. So, I think those are the things that help us. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much, Richard. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Your line is now open. Charles Grom : Hey, thanks. Richard, if inflation stays up in that 3.5% to 4.5% range over the next couple of quarters, would you expect that LIFO charge to be about 30 million per quarter or could we adjust it per weaker -- years ago you used to have that charge every quarter or sometimes the credit, just wondering how we handle that from here? Richard Galanti : Yeah. It's hard to say. I wouldn't just say it's that much based on that. It really depends. And mind you, when you have -- again, we've enjoyed a number of years of effectively very little, if any, or no LIFO or eating into our previous LIFO credit 5 and 6 years ago. But what -- if there was consistent inflation going forward for the next 2, 3, 4 quarters, you're going to also see some price increases to those customers.  And I might say some, there's been some already, but in our view, there is less than we could've done. And that will continue and I think the more consistent inflation -- if inflation raise stayed at this level, and we don't know that, but if it did stay at this level even with a LIFO charge, in some ways, it will be offset by price increases. [Indiscernible]. Charles Grom : Okay. Okay. Great, thanks. And then on a -- just a follow-up, and then on the labor front, I'm curious if you guys have observed an increase in applications in roughly 20 states that ended unemployment benefits on September 1st. There's a number of companies have spoken to a big increase in job applications recently. Richard Galanti : I don't know the -- I haven't asked and I don't know the answer to that. It makes sense. Charles Grom : Okay. All right. Good luck. Thanks. Richard Galanti : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is now open. Karen Short : Hi, thanks very much. I just want to clarify one thing on that last line of questioning, in terms of the LIFO charge, was this 30 million a catch-up for the whole year, or was that something that was reflective of the quarter itself? Because to get that, speaks to the run rate. Richard Galanti : It's the quarter, it's basically if you take your cost -- silos of inventory and what was it at Q3 end and what is it now at Q4 end. Karen Short : Okay. So, I guess obviously as you lifted all these different pressure points on pricing, I guess my bigger picture question is, how do you think about the membership fee structure in general?  There are all these pressures on I guess your business, but also on the consumer from the inflationary standpoint, make you more likely, less likely, or how does it impact your membership fee increase decision process? Richard Galanti : What we've said over the years is that certainly, we look at our gross profit as a combination of a gross margin plus a membership fee. But we really don't look at it together in that way you that, \"Hey, if we do something with the membership fee, we could be more aggressive on pricing. \" I remember years ago somebody had asked when the economy had softened and our comps did weaken a little bit and we were coming up on that fifth anniversary - ish of a pending increase and somebody said, given the economy's weaker you and your sales have weakened a little bit, still a positive number, but weakened a little bit.  Would you still do it? And the response at the time was more likely we will do it because that's what we do. We could drive lower prices with it and drive more business. And so, we really do -- we look at the loyalty and certainly, the loyalty and renewal rates have been up. [Indiscernible] If obviously, we're still a way away from anniversarying the last 5th year or so, the 5th plus year anniversarying of the last increase. So, we're a little way from thinking about it. Karen Short : Okay. And then just a -- we had a conference today with some large-cap names that indicated that their new view on what their actual cash balance should be going forward relative to pre-pandemic had actually increased. So, wondering if you could just talk about your perspective on what you think the rate the rate of sustainable cash balance could be because obviously, you are still sitting on a pretty hefty excess cash balance now. Richard Galanti : I think if the -- we've always been considered to have more cash and have a more conservative balance sheet. I think as the world is saying that they think that it should be going up more. I don't think we've thought about it going up more.  In fact, when we did the capital raise in April of '20 and related specifically to what if -- was the worst-case of COVID, once -- 6 months later, we saw that we didn't need it. We probably gave it back to our shareholders and then a little. So, I think the other anomaly has been is we've been blessed with a very good fiscal year. The last year and a half in terms of net income and operating cash flow relative to our CAPEX, our regular dividend, and the special, let's say that kind of offset the capital -- the debt we did. So, at the end of the day, I don't see us changing our MO in that at this point. Karen Short : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Chris Horvers : Thanks. How all stay good prior to the price [Indiscernible] I guess if I'm interpreting what you're saying is it basically, it's because these pressures seem more structural in nature and because the demand environment is so good, you feel less compelled to be more aggressive on price, and if the environment slows, then that could change your calculus? Richard Galanti : It's really all about the value proposition. Are -- if anything, I think from the outside, people would look at us relative to other retailers and say we've been more aggressive on holding prices than others, at least that's how we feel.  But we have to be pragmatic as these things are permanent consistent. You've got to raise the price; we can't be completely noble here. But we feel that if anything, that moat has probably widened a little bit for us and that's great, we like wider moats. Chris Horvers : So, the third variable being those others are raising prices faster than you, so the price gaps have widened. Richard Galanti : That's our view. That's our buyer's view. But we're looking at, frankly, given how strong it's been, and in our DNA, we hate raising prices. We want to be the last to raise it and the first to lower it. Is in our DNA not even -- putting on shades on the side and not even looking, at others. We're looking at how do we drive our own business and we know that being the most -- the best value out there and having great merchandise and all that other wonderful stuff is how you do it. And as we've seen such strength in our numbers, and then as we've encountered rising levels in inflation, where can we hold the price on some things? And that's what we do. It's an art form more than a science. But it seems to work for us. Chris Horvers : For sure. So, my second question is on the membership fee MFI growth X to FX benefit that you've seen, that number is accelerated the past two quarters. So, is it -- given that the accounting of this is over a 12-month basis, you have a view -- you have some inkling on what that growth could be as you look forward? Higher renewal rates, obviously, taking a ton of share, should all else equal that level? Again, MFI growth Ex Fx continues to accelerate? Richard Galanti : Well, the big answer is we hope so. The fact that we are opening more units in '21 than we did in '20 is a positive. The fact that there are several international units that tends to have higher growth rates. The fact that Auto Renew is kind of a freebie in the sense that more people getting -- signing up and putting your credit card on their application -- in their application or signing up for the -- more importantly, signing up for the Citi Visa card. That helps you a little bit driving the Executive Member, getting more people today -- if every 100 people signing up today, I think a little over half, I don't have an exact number, sign up as an executive member.  I remember 6, 7 years ago, or 8 years ago, it was half that percentage. And these are rough numbers, so don't hold me to them. But at the end of the day, executive members, by its definition, have higher renewal rates. They shop more frequently; they buy more stuff. So, all of that stuff is -- that -- those are all good factors for us. Chris Horvers : And just one quick last one I have you shared how many -- the percentage of your membership that has -- in the U.S. that have the Citi Bank private label card? Richard Galanti : I don't think we have. Chris Horvers : Okay. Thanks. Best of luck. Richard Galanti : By the way, before the next question, somebody checked a number, but we have seen a recent increase in applications in the last couple of weeks. I think Chuck asked that. Okay? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi. Your line is now open. Brandon Cheatham : Hey everyone, it's Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. Gonna take a stab at the membership question as well. You know you have some great memberships statistics; it sounds like you're offering great value in the club. I was wondering, are you thinking about not investing as much in the new member promotions? Anything that you could talk about there, has that looked similar to last year, or has that increased? Richard Galanti : No, I think -- when you say member promotions what do you mean? Brandon Cheatham : I think right now you're offering $40 on a Costco cash card if you sign up. Richard Galanti : Oh, marketing. We did -- we do a variety of things. Not a huge basis, but we tried some things in the last few years. We've done some things with Groupon and with, one other one -- Living Social.  We've done some things as you've mentioned, but those are not on -- there I'd say they're on a regular -- irregular basis and we try different things all the time, but I know -- I think that's really, frankly, independent of looking at the membership fee itself. It's really about how do we drive memberships and what is the incremental cost? What is the true cost of acquiring a new member other than waiting for them to go online or walk into the warehouse to sign up themselves? And so, we're always trying some new things. Brandon Cheatham : Got it. And you mentioned your own chartered ships. I was just wondering what percentage of your shipping that would represent next year. Richard Galanti : Less than 20%. Brandon Cheatham : Less than 20. Got it. Richard Galanti : Less than 20% of our Asia shipping. Brandon Cheatham : Got it, okay. And the last one for me, on the e-com side, I was just wondering your customer that shops there, do they visit the store as frequently as a member that doesn't shop online? Richard Galanti : I don't know that off the top of my head. What I -- and I don't have all the specific statistics in front of us. All the charts that we look at keep going in the right direction. The number of people that bought online, percentage of members, the hit rate when we do something on an e-mail to get people to do something online. BobNelson: What we do know is when we shop online and, in the warehouse, you typically shop maybe a few less times in the warehouse, but you overall spend more. Richard Galanti : What Bob has mentioned, thank you, Bob, is that when you are -- if you take a regular, loyal member and when they do start shopping online, they may shop a few times less in-store, but the aggregate of the two is greater than their historical. Which makes up? By the way, the other thing there is that the online, while we're constantly putting on what I'll call greater frequently traffic building items velocity items. And like apparel and health and beauty aids and things like that. The fact that matter is more and more big and bulky items are bought online.  Years ago, if you wanted to buy a mattress or a refrigerator, you had to go buy it and pick it up and take it home. We didn't deliver. We didn't install it. That's of course changed in the last many years and we have an Appliance business in the U.S. that's well over a billion dollars and growing fast -- continue to grow fast, helped by Costco Logistics. So that changes the metric a little bit too. Brandon Cheatham : Great. Thanks for the additional color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from Davidson. Your line is now open. Mike Baker : Hi. Thanks. Two questions for me. One, you did allude to the Delta variant and having to limit some products in areas where we've seen higher cases. So, could you just talk about overall different trends that you might be seeing in areas that are seeing bigger spikes in the new COVID variant versus others? Richard Galanti : I don't know. I don't have in front of me any detail by region in that regard. What I do know is, like everything right now it's all over the board. We're talking -- I forget what cleaning supply it was, whether it was Clorox, or Lysol, or some type of antibacterial wipe or whatever it was.  But there had been -- a year ago there was a shortage of merchandise, now they've got plenty of merchandise, but there's 2 to 3-week delays on getting it delivered because there's a limit on short-term changes to trucking and delivery needs of the supplier. So, it really is all over the board. Mike Baker : And maybe as part of that, any seeing anything in terms of the travel trends, which now we're coming back really strong as last quarter. Richard Galanti : Yes. Mike Baker : But has Delta reverted that at all? Richard Galanti : Yes. Yes. If you look to the chart, which went down, so it's that -- last summer or last spring it was negative, more refunds than new things being bought. It really got back to almost normal. I'm talking about, bookings of resort vacations and -- to Hawaii and to Mexico and things like that.  And just a month ago -- month-and-a-half, two months ago, at the monthly budget being the charts were showing us it's almost back to where it was pre-COVID. And then it fell like a rock, not as bad as it was at its drought last spring, but it's certainly calmed down. Cars were not hit as bad, but that will fluctuate based on, again, what's going on out there. Mike Baker : That all makes sense. One more quick one that was one question in two parts. Can you update us on the curbside pickup test that you were running in New Mexico, I think as of last time we spoke it was in 3 stores? Richard Galanti : Right. We're currently not doing it. We discontinued it, for now, we'll try some new things somewhere sometime, but at this point, we got a lot of good things going on and we really didn't see a lot of traction in it. Mike Baker : Interesting. Thanks for the call, I appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Betti from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Rupesh Betti : Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. So, I guess just going back to the core margin. So, it sounded like at least this past quarter on the pricey side, you guys delayed passing through some of the price increases. So, if you look at non-foods versus your foods categories, is it generally easier to pass through on the non-food side versus the food side? Richard Galanti : I wouldn't say that. I think food -- fresh turns so fast, it turns more than 50 times a year or whatever. And we've got a hot price on strip steaks or keeping the rotisserie chicken and for $0.99, that's going to impact you a little faster. Unidentified Representative : [Indiscernible] Richard Galanti : But the comment here is that we're not going to change the price of muffins every week. So, we'll take a little less margin on some items. I think it's all over the board. But at the end of the day, it's an art form, not a science, or not straight across, we're going to do this much on every item. Rupesh Betti : Okay, great. And then the second question, just as you look at your Service business, Optical, Food Court, et cetera, where are we versus where you were pre-pandemic? Have those businesses fully recovered at this point? Richard Galanti : Mostly. Pharmacy and Optical have. Food courts have come back, Hearing Aids not quite yet, but much better than it was at its trough -- Unidentified Representative :  [Indiscernible] Richard Galanti : And Travel is lots of fun based on what's going on with COVID. Rupesh Betti : Okay, great. And one final question. I mean, I may have missed this in your prepared comments. Did you guys give a forecast for CAPEX for the upcoming fiscal year? Richard Galanti : No, it will have a three in front of it. Rupesh Betti : Okay. Okay. Thank you. Best of luck, the balance of the year. Unidentified Representative : One more question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is now open. John Heinbockel : So, Richard, you said it's an art, not a science. I'm curious where you guys sit on data science and analytics around price elasticity, 1. And 2, personalization of the monthly mailer or monthly e-mails. Where are we on that journey? Richard Galanti : First of all, as it relates to pricing and elasticity, I think if we were considered the best Company in the world with data analytics, we would still not use it for price elasticity. We're going to do what we do as merchants and look at competitive prices, and see how low we can mark something up. And the old saying from years ago, we want to improve margins and lower prices at the same time by buying better and doing those things. So, I don't see that happening at all. As it relates to the other aspect of that, that's coming. We made a big investment in what I'll call data analytics for us because we went from darn near 0 to something.  But brought on a VP of data analytics a year ago in March. There's been a lot of progress, a lot of focus to date has been on the merchandising side, providing better tools to buy and to project, and things like that. I think you'll see more of that over the next year, but again, we're getting there.  I always look at it as just some of the things that others are doing that will help. It's low-hanging fruit for us because we haven't done it yet, but we'll keep going. But that's where a lot of the data analytic function to date in this past year as we built a department around it, has been just that. John Heinbockel : And then secondly, one of the things you guys have been known for is seasonally getting in and out before everybody else. So, you lean into that in an environment where it's hard to chase product, getting it early, people buy it, and they're done for the season. Do you lean into that more in terms of where you can more inventory, get it in the clobber, or is there a limitation because you've got a transition from one season to the next? Richard Galanti : I think there's a little bit of both. There is a little bit of taking it where you can get it right now, and certainly, we're consciously bringing in. I think I mentioned even what was the furniture where the cycle has gone from 12 and 14 weeks to 16 and 18, we're bringing in early. And certainly, on seasonal things, we'll do that on some items. But it's a mixed bag just because we're pivoting and blocking and tackling in 12 different directions like everybody. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Richard Galanti : We have time for one last question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is now open. Kelly Bania : Hi, thanks for fitting me in, Richard. Just wanted to ask one more on the inflation you mentioned that the 3.5 to 4.5 range, just want to clarify that is retail inflation? Just curious what your cost inflation is, and just trying to get a sense of how much you're absorbing. And maybe if you can just provide some examples of how Costco and the merchants are mitigating some of the pressures. Unidentified Representative :  [Indiscernible] Richard Galanti : It's both. I am sorry, what? Margins have generally stayed the same, I mean, we gave you some examples on the side of the fresh food, where it's changed and why, but generally speaking, I think there is, again, a lot of moving parts and we continue to figure out how to balance it. Kelly Bania : Any examples you want to provide about how you're mitigating some of the pressures? Richard Galanti : Well, I mean, I'm not on a specific product example, but the fact is, one we've got strong relationships and good buying power with our vendors. When we're eating a little bit into something, we're asking in some cases for them to eat a little bit into it. During these times, we're constantly figuring out how to be where they're any cost savings to offset some of the cost increases.  Whether it's packaging or whatever it might be. And so, I mean, I think one of the things that help us is that we're worried about managing 3,800 items, not 100,000 items or 50,000 items, and that's helped us. Yeah, there are times where we'll be pivoting in and out of items for that reason also. Sorry to be vague but it really is, there are just so many different things out there. Kelly Bania : Right. Thank you. Richard Galanti : Well, thank you, everyone will be around for any additional questions, and have a good week and talk to you next time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal '22, the 12 weeks ended November 21st. Net income for the quarter came in at $1.324 billion or $2.98 per diluted share compared to $1.166 billion or $2.52 per diluted share last year. This year included a cash benefit of $91 million or $0.21 this year related to stock-based compensation and a write-off of certain IT assets of $118 million pre-tax or $0.20 per share. Last year include a tax benefits of $145 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, $0.16 of which was due to the deductibility of the $10 per share special cash dividend received by the company's 401(k) plan participants and $0.17 related to stock-based compensation as well an incremental expenses for COVID-19 premium wages of $212 million pre-tax, which was a hit last year in the quarter of $0.35 per share. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.7% to $49.42 billion, up from $42.35 billion a year earlier in the first quarter. Same-store sales for the first quarter were as follows : In the U.S., on a reported basis for the 12 weeks, up 14.9% and excluding gas inflation and the impacts of FX, up 9.9%. Canada reported 17.2% ex gas and FX plus 8.3%. Other international reported 13.4 ex gas and inflation in FX up 10.9% Total the company reported a 15% increase on a comp basis and 9.8% up ex gas and FX. And e-commerce which was reported at a 14.3 ex FX was 13.3. In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.8% worldwide and at 5.9% in the U.S during the quarter. Our average transaction or ticket was up 7.7% worldwide and 8.5% in the U.S during the quarter. Excluding the positive impact from gas inflation and FX, the average ticket was up ex that plus 2.5% worldwide and plus 3.5% in the U.S. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S dollar positively impact sales by about 90 basis points and gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 430 basis points. Next on the income statement. Membership fee income reported in the quarter of $946 million, up $85 million or 9.9% from last year's $861 million figure. ex FX, the $85 million increase would have been 80 million, and the 9.9% increase would be 9.3%. In terms of renewal rates, our U.S and Canada rate came in at 91.6%, up three tenths of a percent from the 12 week earlier figure at Q4 end as well the worldwide rate came in at 89.0%, also up three tenths of a percent from 12 weeks ago at Q4 quarter end -- Q4 end. The renewal rates are continuing to benefit from more members auto renewing as well as increased penetration of executive members who on average renew at a higher rate than the non-executive members and first year renewal rates which have improved a lot. In terms of number of members at the end of first quarter, in terms of member households as well as total card holders, at Q1 end, total paid households was 52.5 million, up 800,000 from 61.7 a quarter ago, and total cardholders 113.1 million, up a $1.5 million from the 111.6 million 12 weeks ago. At Q1 end paid executive members totaled 26.5 million, an increase of 836,000 during the 12 weeks since Q4 end. The executive members represent 42% of our members and a little over 70% of our sales. Moving down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin for the first quarter was lower year over year by 49 basis points and excluding gas inflation lower year-over-year by 6 basis points. As I normally do, I ask you to jot down a few numbers. There are two columns both reported year-over-year in Q1 and then without gas inflation year-over-year in Q1. First line item would be core merchandise, minus 3x minus 63 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis and minus 26 basis points without gas inflation. Ancillary and other businesses plus two on a reported basis and plus 12x gas -- to gas inflation. 2% reward plus 3 and 1 basis point. LIFO minus three in both columns. Other plus 12 basis points in both columns. Total then are reported basis margins were down 49 basis points year-over-year and ex gas inflation down 6 basis points. In terms of the core merchandise component gross margin being lower by 63 year-over-year and 26 basis points ex gas inflation. Recall last year in Q1 the core reported was up 83 basis points and ex gas up 66 basis points. So we've retained a good portion of the improvement from 2 years ago in the core. In terms of the core margin on their own sales in the first quarter, our core and core margins were lower by 18 basis points, with non foods slightly up and food sundries. slightly lower year-over-year. Also lower year-over-year fresh foods was the primary driver of the core on core being lower in the quarter. Fresh continues to lap -- to lap exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outside sales that began the year -- that happened a year ago in the quarter. Ancillary another business gross margin was higher by 2 basis points on a reported basis and again plus 12 basis points ex gas inflation. Gas and travel were better year-over-year as they anniversary a softer quarter a year ago, offset by e-com, which was particularly strong a year ago and also related to the pandemic. LIFO, we had a 3 basis point or $14 million LIFO charge in the quarter. 2% reward higher by 3 on a reported basis and lower by one excluding gas inflation, a reflection of slightly higher sales penetration going to the increased number of executive members,. And other was up 12 basis points. This is related to COVID related costs from a year ago. That portion of the COVID related wages that go into the cost of sales like many of our manufacturing businesses and our bakery departments, given the inflationary pressures and our ongoing efforts to mitigate price increases to our members in the face of inflation as best we can, our Q1 gross margins results on all I think we're pretty good. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the first quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 66 basis points and 29 basis points excluding gas inflation, again jotting down two columns of numbers. First column being reported and the second column being ex gas inflation. Operations was better or lower by 40 basis points and ex gas inflation better or lower by 11 basis points. Central reported better by 10. Without inflation, gas inflation better by 6, stock compensation better by 2 and worse by 1 in the two columns, and other better by 14 and better by 13 year-over-year. Total then again on a reported basis, our SG&A was better or lower by 66 basis points, and ex gas inflation lower or better by 29 basis points. The -- keep in mind, in terms of the core again better by 40 or better by 11 ex gas inflation. Keep in mind this result includes the permanent dollar and hour wage increase that began in March of 2021. And 4 weeks of additional starting wage increases that we just took this past October going from $16 to $17 and from $16 -- $15 to $18 for our two main categories of hourly employees. These latest changes in the starting wages went into effect October 25, just 6 weeks ago, and 4 weeks of those 6 weeks are included in Q1 - and Q1. Central, that's it no surprises there. Again, ex gas inflation basis better by 6. Stock comp as I mentioned a little better, a little worse by 1 ex gas inflation and other the 14 and the 13 basis points numbers. This consistent of the COVID expense of 150 million -- $159 million last year and the $180 million write off of the impacted IT assets that I mentioned earlier. Next on the income statement is preopening expense. This year in the quarter $28 million, last year in the quarter 22 or 6 million higher. All told, reporting operating income in the first quarter increased 18% coming in at $1.693 billion this year in the quarter compared to $1.43 billion last year. Below the operating income, line interest expense was $39 million each of the first quarters of fiscal '21 and '22. Interest income, interest expense rather, interest income and other for the quarter was higher by 13 million year-over-year, primarily due to favorable FX. Overall reported pre-tax income in the first quarter was up 19% coming in at $1.696 billion. This year compared in the first quarter last year of $1.42 billion. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter of '22 was 20.7% compared to 16.8% in Q1 last year. Again both years tax rates benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation as mentioned earlier. $91 million this year and $75 million last year in the quarter. Additionally, last year's tax rate benefited from the tax deductibility of a special dividend, that portion payable to the company's 401(k) plan participants. For fiscal '22, effective tax rate excluding these discrete items is currently projected to be between 26% and 27%. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, as you know, for fiscal '21, we opened 22 units including to reload. So a net increase of 20 units during fiscal '21. And this quarter that ended a couple of weeks ago, we opened nine units including one relo, So net openings of 8. For the remainder of the year, we plan to open 23 new units, and also -- print open 23 units, 4 of which would be relocations. So in that '19 if all goes as planned. It's been a busy past seven days. We opened our second Costco in France last Saturday on December 4, followed by our second building in China, which opened yesterday, as well as two buildings opening this morning -- opening today, one in the U.S in Florida and our fourth unit in Spain. Regarding CapEx, our first quarter fiscal '22 spend was approximately $1.05 billion. Our full year CapEx spend is estimated to be just about $4 billion. This would represent an increase of more than $400 million over last year's entire CapEx figure of $3.6 billion. The largest areas have increased coming from international spending for new warehouse expansion and increased investment in our logistics and e-com fulfillment operations. In terms of e-commerce, sales in the quarter ex FX increased 13.3% year-over-year. That's of course on top of the 86% plus increase a year ago in the first quarter. Stronger departments in terms of year over percentages include jewelry, tires and home furnishings. Our largest merchandise department in terms of sales majors, which is everything from consumer electronics and TVs to appliances, etcetera, was up in the high single digits also on a very strong sales increase a year earlier. In terms of an update on Costco logistics, it continues to drive our big and bulky sales. For the quarter, Costco logistics deliveries were up over 50% and now represent about 70% of our U.S e-com big and bulky shipments. Average -- with average during the quarter more than 50,000 stops per week. And for the year, we project more than $3 million stops, which would be anything from dropping something off to installing and taking away the old plans. For logistics in the full year, Our e-com mobile app. We continue to improve the site with additional features thus far as I've talked about the last few quarters of quarterly calls. We redesigned the app Header and Footer, we've updated and improved the menu layout. Our members now have the ability to view warehouse receipts online via both the app and desktop. Our co-brand Citi Visa card is now linked. It can now be linked to the digital membership card and can be used for payment. Our members are now able to much more easily reschedule e-com deliveries in the U.S and Canada. Same goes for rescheduling returns pickups and delivering in the first half of the new upcoming new calendar year. Labelling of fulfillment a better labeling of fulfillment methods. Members can -- it will be easily the -- will be able to easily see fulfillment options, be at e-com same day, and even nearby warehouse availability of a particular item at a particular item level. We're rolling out new e-com kiosks in the warehouse with video signage and easy touch screen ordering as well. We're rolling out e-commerce lockers. Currently in the U.S., we have 112 locations with more and --- we plan to more than double that number during calendar year 2022. In terms of e-commerce, there's a program that received some press yesterday just yesterday called Costco next, in a way it's like our warehouse road shows, but online, currently, there are 34 suppliers and growing, but it's still quite small, offering just under 1,000 items, curated items with Costco values, so please check it out when you have a chance. From a supply chain perspective, similar issues that we outlined in 12 weeks ago on the last quarter we call. Each issue ebbs and flows a little bit. But overall, the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container challenges, COVID disruptions, shortages of various components, raw materials, ingredients, and even packaging supplies, labor cost pressures and truck driver challenges. Overall, we feel we've dealt pretty well with the supply chain challenges in terms of delayed container arrivals on the Pacific Coast. About 79% of our import containers are late by an average of 51 days. A few percentage of those were actually a few days early and many of them are a few days more than 51 late. Virtually all departments are impacted. We've ordered early in many cases as I mentioned, I think in earlier calls, given the lower longer lead times, less product and packaging challenges, but still quite a bit. Still some limitations on key items, but improving again, it ebbs and flows. Chip shortage is still impacting many items, some more than others. In some instances, delayed inventory simply extends the season, an example might be lawn and garden and patio. As soon as the product arrives, it sells pretty quickly. But it may extend into beyond the normal seasonal time, toys and seasonal in fact, same thing, some inventory, in fact, won't make it before Christmas, but we've mitigated that as best as possible, and feel pretty good about it. And in terms of moving on to -- despite all the supply chain issues, again, we're pretty -- feel pretty good about staying in stock and continuing to work to mitigate cost and price increases as best we can. Moving on to inflation. Again, it's pretty much the same story that we told during each of the last two quarters. There have been there have been in our variety of inflationary pressures that we and others are seeing, from labor costs to freight costs to higher demand to container shortages and port delays to increase demand on certain product categories. Much of what you see and read out there are very shortages on everything from chips to oils and chemical supply by facilities hit by the Gulf store was a while back, higher commodity prices. For Q1 '22, and talking with our merchants and merchants, we estimate that overall year-over-year price inflation to be in the 4.5% to 5% range. That's a little bit higher of an estimated inflation rate that I discussed a quarter ago. But I think pretty consistent with what you read out there. All the said, much kudos to the job that our merchants and our traffic department and our operators have all been able to do in order to get the products that we need to pivot when and where necessary and keep our warehouses full. While keeping prices low for our members and continuing to show value versus our competitors. Look I think overall this is reflect this is best reflected in the operating results that we continue to achieve despite these many challenges. Anecdotally on merchandising, holiday stuff has been strong, again, sometimes it depends on when the merchandise gets in. Baking items more people seem to be getting together a strong -- gift cards are up, dramatically from a year ago, but it was weak a year ago. Pet products as you might expect are strong with the benefit of increasing pet population over the past couple of years. Alcohol [ph] and spirits are strong, including gift boxes of various items. And, of course continued strength in consumer electronics, appliances, furniture and mattresses and the like. Apparel actually has enjoyed much stronger sales growth this year,. albeit compared to a relatively flat apparel sales a year ago. One last comment. Our sustainability commitment website received a major refresh this week. So please feel free to visit the site. It's linked directly from our homepage under the column about us and then click on sustainability commitment. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday January 2, on Wednesday, January 5 after market close. With that I will open it up to questions and turn it back over to Sadie. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] For our first question we have Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael, your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question, which are your point about 4% to 5% in inflationary increase across the assortment. Typically Costco has been slower to raise prices than everyone else that seems to be a number that's in line with others across the retail sector. So is the -- is it the posture changed with respect to passing along price increases? Why is that the case? And if Costco have more pricing power today than it ever has in the past, given the pricing gaps between you and others in the market? Richard Galanti : Well, I think as it relates to a passing on, we've always said we want to be the last to raise the price in the -- first to lower the price, recognizing there's a limit to what you can do based on these cost increases. First and foremost, I think because of our relative purchasing power and our relationships with our vendors, we with our suppliers work to mitigate those increases in any way shape or form we can, Ultimately that may include us taking a little more less markup and maybe then taking a less markup. There's no complete, consistent answer throughout as you might expect. But overall, I think we've done a relatively good job of that and there is inflation in those numbers, those numbers are kind of a combination of our cost increases as well as our some price increases and, again, it fluctuate there. For every few examples of something going up, there may be an example of something flatter, going down a little bit for unrelated reasons. And so again, it's a best guess, it's fluid. We saw inflation starting several months ago in a bigger way, I think, in our fiscal Q4 this summer, and continuing into this fiscal year and as we all have read articles, general articles out there about certain different major consumer product manufacturers announcing increases and continue to do so. So I think it's going to continue, hopefully, we're getting towards the top and it'll start flattening out and subsiding. But we'll see. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is with the core merchandise margin ex fuel and core on core gross margin getting less bad or declining at a lesser rate, this quarter than last. Is this a sign that the margin here is stabilizing? And do you think the Costco exits the pandemic with a structurally higher gross margin than it had in the past, or all these dynamics simply a function of what you've often said, which is when overall retail margins go up, go to Costco for just a little less than others. Thank you. Richard Galanti : So I think I'm the last comment, yes, in terms of that last comment you made. Look, I think, at the end of the day, I think we -- in many ways have benefited from market share gains. Hopefully some or most of which will be sticky. The biggest thing that impacts margins many often is not only on the buying power side, and arguably, I can't think of any company that has the buying power per item that we do, because we do roughly $200 billion in sales with 4,000 ish items versus anybody else that's doing it with hundreds of thousands of items, or 50,000 items. But I think that having higher levels of sales productivity, particularly in things like fresh foods, helps your margin. We'll keep some of that and we'll use it to be even more competitive and hopefully, build a bigger model a little bit. But I think that some of it is probably structurally there. But as some famous TV actress said, once it's always thought is always going to be something. And, we'll keep fighting that battle out there. But we feel pretty good about some of the structural things that have occurred that hopefully will help us in the future. But we'll have to wait and see. Michael Lasser : Great. Thank you very much and have a good holiday. Thank you. Operator : For our next question, we have Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon, your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Hey, everyone. I'll be Simeon for this call. My first question is actually a follow-up to Michael's second question. Maybe I'll ask it a different way, Richard. The 2-year core on core looks like it's actually getting better. And you said it yourself, you thought you did a pretty good job on it, and it looks like you are. So if we're kind of getting it feels like you're managing through the worst of it. And the environment may be getting better at the margin. I don't want to go too far. And say that, why shouldn't be this be the worst for the core on core notwithstanding comparisons, but the minute they get harder, but then they start to get easier. Richard Galanti : Yes, look, I think that's hopefully how the storybook goes. It's always going to be something but no, look, we Jokes aside, we feel pretty good about structurally what we've been able to accomplish. And part of that is market share with higher sales levels. And we've not stopped the -- what I'll call the buyer creativity of working with suppliers to figure out how to continue to drive greater value. I can think of 50 examples, but at the end of the day, we're continuing to drive value in lots of ways and whether it's changing packaging, or using our volume, moving certain production to different parts of the world. And to take -- to again to make that moat even a little bigger. So I agree with you that so far, the story that you suggested is playing out, and hopefully it'll continue to play out. Simeon Gutman : Fair enough. My second question is more on SG&A and the business's leverage point. We used to chat about, Costco, always doing mid single digit comps and that's good enough to cover the SG&A dollar growth. I think this quarter, the business did about 6.5% dollar growth adjusted. And you're going to have some of these wage investments that don't annualize Well, maybe not to the middle or to closer to the end of the year. So I'm trying to get at what a normal post COVID SG&A rate may look like. And then, does that mean it's sort of that mid single-digit comp rate that leverages those expenses, I think is related to the probably the best estimate and I say guesstimate not estimate on where do you start? Where's the inflection point of leveraging SG&A probably still is in that mid single-digit range. Beyond that, who the heck knows. I mean, we've been able notwithstanding some of these increases. We've been a, particularly in wages, we've been able to in strong comps have helped help these numbers. But I think we feel pretty good about having the sales volumes that continue to be able to leverage those expenses. So as soon as we find out, we'll let you know. But again, we're feeling pretty good about things at this juncture. And at some point, I would assume comps have to come back to hopefully better than pure average, but something back to where they had been pre-COVID, but on a higher base, and even that helps you a little bit. Simeon Gutman : Okay, great. Thanks. Happy holidays, everyone. Richard Galanti : You too. Operator : For the next question, we have Christopher Horvers from JP Morgan. Christopher, your line is open. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good evening, everybody. So, I wanted to ask a little bit about your thoughts on holiday pull forward. Obviously, you saw an acceleration in trend on a 2-year basis in October, and then November things obviously, still amazing comp and gaining share. But trends decelerated and it was sort of against what was a weaker, I think, end of the month last year. So, can you talk about, like, what do you think is driving that? How do you think about the rest of the holiday season? And as you think about a consumer that's going to lap a bunch of stimulus in the first half of next year, what are your initial thoughts on how that all could play out? Richard Galanti : Well, I think, again, as you just mentioned, November's comps were a shade under outside expectations, still very good, a couple percentage points different than what we had been enjoying the couple of months prior that. Probably the view is a little bit of that was pulling forward. But even within last month's number, the weeks varied, and overall, we're good. But just when it comes -- when it is reduced a little the next day, it's better than you expected. So I think the one thing that I feel good about is, is our in-stocks. Our senior merchant the other day had indicated in his view is that, his feeling is that we're better and stocked than anybody out there. And I think part of that is the fact of limited selection, that we are an item business, we could put something else in place or something. But we've done a pretty good job. I mean, I had a -- with a little bit of a chuckle at a call just yesterday from a reporter asking about how are we doing on cream cheese. And so I checked and [indiscernible] cream cheese shortage out there and the bagel shops are being challenged. We actually got it as the buyer said, it took a little extra work, but we've got all the cream cheese we need. So I think we've done a good job in merchandising. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And so, I guess as you think about last year, and the stimulus I mean, do you think that -- I mean actually I think the consumer, as you get closer to Christmas and New Year's, probably comes back if people are entertaining more, like you said in the baking side. But as you get into January and stimulus and stimulus in the spring, do you think your business lifted off a stimulus last year? Bob Nelson : It couldn't hurt, it probably helped a little bit. I know historically when there's been some stimulus items out there factors, our view is that we have not been impacted as much as other, but directionally we've been impacted the same. Look, if next year, there's a reduction in stimulus, lord knows what's going to happen with the stock market in general and how people feel about where they -- how they feel financially. That may change a little bit. But I feel -- we feel pretty good around here, that one of the things that we've shown over the years that both in good and bad times, we tend to do well, and good times, because people want to spend more and even in less good times people want to save more. And so I think from a merchandising stem and in tougher times, there's additional products and services that might be willing to sell us for the first time. So in our own perverse way, we sometimes benefit from good and bad and right now we're feeling pretty good about what the future looks like. Richard Galanti : Oh, by the way, the other thing that Bob just mentioned, that even if certain things head south in some way, shape or form like reduction or lack or elimination of certain stimulus items, supply chain at some point is going to get better. As good as our members are, we could do better if we had more supply of certain of those items. Even in some categories in non-food that are up 20% and 30% plus, the buyers view, we're still running out of stuff, or to do better if we had more. And that's not just us, I mean that's -- it's rains on everybody. But I think some improvement in supply chain will be an offset any other things that are detrimental to that thought. Christopher Horvers : Got it. Thanks very much and enjoy the run on cream cheese at the clubs this weekend. Take care. Bob Nelson : Historic. Operator : For our next question, we have Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Chuck, your line is open. Charles Grom : Hey, Richard and Bob team. Hope you guys are doing well, Question on leverage. If we back up the one-time charges in the quarter, it looks like you enjoyed over 100 basis points of improvement year-over-year and 65 basis points last quarter. And fully realizing the comps on a stock basis were better, but wondering if some investments or other costs may have rolled off. Just some thoughts on that front. Richard Galanti : I think more of it is just the leverage of sales growth, frankly. Again, taking out the specific COVID related charges that we talked about, and factors we didn't talk about in terms of separating in the press release was that dollar an hour increase we did in March, and the new one that had a small impact in Q1 because it started 6 weeks ago. But in that regard, there's nothing that stands out in my view. And my guess estimate, I'm looking at my guys here, do you -- it was strong -- strong sales would be the number one factor. Charles Grom : Okay. Okay, fair enough. And then just on the storefront, 14 opened thus far in '22. So you're more than halfway to the goal, which is great. I was just wondering bigger picture, has there been any more discussions to backfill some of your existing markets, your higher density areas where perhaps some stores, just can't handle any more productivity more -- any more throughput just because of the volumes? Richard Galanti : I think that's -- the answer is yes. And I think that'll be small methodical increases in that thought over the next several years. I mean, it used to be that we talked about when we had 400 warehouses and the average, I'm making those numbers up. So the average was 180. And now the I think we have an average several years later in the high 200s in the U.S at least. And we have a number of units in the 300 to 400 range. I mean, not the hundreds, but 10s of. And so we're looking for more infill. That we've been doing that and if it was 3 to 5 a year, or 3 to 7 a year, in the last 5 years, is it going to be 5 day a year. Could be I don't have that kind of detail in front of me. Charles Grom : Okay, great. And then my last one is just a follow-up on Chris's on November. I believe you guys did call out that there was some moderation in retail inflation, maybe 150 basis points or so. I\u2019m just wondering if you could provide any color on where that retail inflation came in. And I guess why that happened? Was it self inflicted, just wanted to get some color there. Richard Galanti : One thing that was a little lower was from the increases in food and sundries and some food sundries items in fresh. That had spiked even more, it's still up year-over-year, but it spiked a little, it came down a little bit from where it had been. And then we haven't quantified anything specific beyond that. Charles Grom : Okay. All right. Bob Nelson : And as you might expect, they're their suppliers out there. They're saying hey, come January, February, you'll see some more increases. And, again, this is not consistent with what you -- what I've read in general articles in the various business periodicals. Charles Grom : Okay. So just a lot of timing differences. Okay. Richard Galanti : Yes. Charles Grom : Great. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Operator : For the next question, we have John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. John, your line is open. John Heinbockel : So, Richard, how is KS [ph] performing and what happens or how do you think about it in an inflationary environment, in terms of how you take price versus like items on the national brand side. And this KS do better in an inflationary environment? Richard Galanti : Look, many of our KS items are of such large volumes. It's not unlike dealing with the comparable large volumes we do in a branded CPG item. And so we're out there, fighting with both of them to try to mitigate those cost increases. KS still grows at a little faster rate than others, but nothing discernible. I think we keep finding new items to do KS with and for a variety of different reasons. And so it continues to drive that brand. But no, I don't think there's a -- we don't see a big difference of how that's changing. John Heinbockel : Okay. Secondly, you're talking the 70% on Costco Logistics is 70% of your needs. You're at what capacity in logistics? Is it still 50%? Or is it crept above that? Richard Galanti : It's in the 50% range. Maybe it's slightly higher than that, based on our when we originally bought what's now Costco Logistics, a year and a half ago. We moved over a bunch of volume, we've grown it as well, grown our total base of need. And I think we're slightly above the 50% that we felt we had capacity for at the time. And we certainly have plenty of capacity over the next few years. Mind you, we're spending money on it. Part of our fulfillment and logistics as I think I mentioned on the last quarterly call, within CapEx we had spended $340 million or so on a multi acre million, 1.6 million square foot distribution facility in Southern California. That's for a variety of needs. Some of the -- much of what we bought Innovel acquisition in March or April of 2020, more than 10 million square feet of space around the country, much of its leased. Much of its fine, by the way, but we're not all that was geographically, particularly the big sites, 2 billion square foot sites were an area is where we're stronger relative to where Sears is stronger, or they had most of their business at the time. So we're still spending money on it and upgrading it. But we\u2019re -- again, from a merchandising standpoint, we're very excited about it. And it's helped us grow that business in a big way. And given our small market share of many of those items, particularly on the plant side, we feel there's a lot of growth potential for us. John Heinbockel : Okay, thank you. Operator : For the next question, we have Karen Short from Barclays. Karen, your line is open. Karen Short : Hey, thanks very much. I wanted to just talk about ticket a little bit. So U.S ticket at 3.5%? Can you kind of parse that out on per transaction versus AUP, but also tie that into the inflation numbers that you called out for the quarter and/or your expectations on inflation? Richard Galanti : Honestly, I can't. I don't have that detail in front of me. Generally speaking, you've got electronics that like TVs and what have you that are going down in price, maybe a little less this year, because there's less promotions because of shortages. I mean, in every budget meeting every 4 weeks were presented examples of items where we're taking down the price of high volume key items by changing the packaging by moving some aspect of manufacturing to another part of the world. And so I don't have the detail here in front of me for that. Sorry. Karen Short : Okay. And then I wanted to -- I don't think this has been asked for a while. But can you give an update maybe on what the average ticket is for executive members versus gold? And then, I know you gave, obviously, you've given the percent of sales, but frequency of executive versus gold, how maybe that's changed over the last, almost 2 years of the pandemic? Richard Galanti : I will -- somebody is just running out of the room to see if they can grab that sheet. And I'll answer it as soon as they get back if you want to ask another question or move on to the next one. But I'll [indiscernible] gets back. Karen Short : Well, my standard question would be just on your cash balance in terms of thoughts on special dividends? Richard Galanti : Oh, well, as soon as we know you'll know or the day after. The -- look our cash position is strong. One of the things I pointed out is our CapEx is also increasing in a conscious way, notwithstanding that our cash flow from operations is growing at a quite a stronger rate as well. It's something that we've done 4x in 8 years. We and the shareholders seem to like it when we do it, and so I'm not trying to be cute, but we haven't made that decision at this juncture. It's probably a win not if, but when it'll be -- when we do it. Karen Short : Okay. And then maybe just while you're waiting for that numbers on the executive, can you just maybe give us some color on what percent of freight is actually spot versus contract? I don't know if you've ever given that number. Richard Galanti : I don't have the exact number, but I'm willing to bet, it's 80% plus. I could be wrong, a little bit, but it contracted. Now recognizing with contracts, we might do 1, 2 and 3 year contracts. So we're still benefiting on 3-year stuff. And then if any little on 2-year stuff, and now gone beyond the benefit of the 1-year stuff, And so it's over two or three year period, but our assumption is, is it'll take less than that time to start to normalize somewhat. Karen Short : Okay, great. Richard Galanti : Is it happen today [indiscernible], yes. Karen Short : Right. Richard Galanti : But it's -- I think we again, we probably with other large users of freight and containers, have probably done a pretty good job of at least staggering, that not having to do a lot of spot stuff so far. Karen Short : Great. Yes. I mean, if you got those numbers on executive and golden ticket and frequency, that'd be great. Richard Galanti : Okay. What they came back with right now is we don't have -- I don't have quickly average ticket changes. But the total spend per executive member compared to a Gold star member is almost 3x. Karen Short : Okay. Thank you. Richard Galanti : Call it 2.5. Thank you. Karen Short : Okay. Thanks so much. Bye. Operator : For our next question, we have Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Greg, your line is open. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. I\u2019ve two questions, Richard. One is digging a little bit into the margins, the gross margins. You said gas and travel have helped, but then offset by e-commerce. Can you sort of explain where -- so that was gas penny profit was up even at the mixer. Is that \u2026 Bob Nelson : Margin percent was down but you got a 40%. 50% increase in price per gallon. Greg Melich : Got it. Richard Galanti : So you still might have more pennies per gallon, but the margin itself was down. Greg Melich : Got it. And then that was offset by e-commerce. Richard Galanti : [Indiscernible] e-commerce. Yes, and again, I would read a lot into any of that description. We're just trying to share with everyone directionally what helps it and hurts a little bit. e-commerce just given all the activity, we've gotten expenditures on fulfillment and expansion, and doing what we can over time when we're pulling tickets if we -- if something else happened. I don't view as a big issue from it. It's not whatever -- whether the margins up a little down a little, it's less about competition and more about what's the product mix that month or week. And what else is going on with this rapid expansion and investment in it? Greg Melich : Got it. And then maybe that's a tie back your discussion on the logistics. Big and bulky, if we look at the e-commerce is roughly 8% of sales, its big and bulky a quarter of that. Is that the kind of scale we're talking about? Richard Galanti : It's over a third. So we\u2019re third, great. Greg Melich : And then last but not least, the renewal rates continuing to tick up I guess, impressive how do we -- what -- it shouldn't have come off at some point. Just given that you have more first year members? Bob Nelson : [Indiscernible] get to 100? No, just kidding. Look, I think as I mentioned earlier in this and when I speaking, probably the single biggest thing that's helping it right now is, auto renew. As we get more people on a credit card both in the two big co-branded in U.S and Canada. That's a no brainer to help a little bit as we convert people to executive member. And as we, for every 100 new people signing up a slightly higher number of them sign up as executive members, they are more likely to renew. So those things help as well. The thing I mentioned about new warehouses and markets around the world tend to be while they have a very much lower renewal rate in their first year of renewal or a year or two, and then now continue to grow as more people have renewed the prior year. Those are starting -- generally those are starting at higher rates than they were. So all those things help a little bit. I'd like to think it's all the wonderful things we do and the value proposition and but certainly auto renew is probably a good help there. Greg Melich : And then last, because someone has to ask it just fee increase, I guess, back half next year is when we'll be 5 years since the last one. What are the thoughts on that? Just given that the members seem to be self selecting the fee hike already through the executive membership? Does that change your thought process as to when you might hike the fee? And our only thought is, is we are probably start getting questions about now. So when we [indiscernible] still a while away, and we certainly feel good, as I've said, in the past, renewal rates, strong renewal rates and loyalty help that process -- so that thought process and we'll see. But it's just a little bit of time to think about it. Greg Melich : Very well have a great holiday season, everyone. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : For our next question, we have Rupesh Betti from Oppenheimer. Rupesh, your line is open. Rupesh Betti : Good evening, thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to touch on Canada and other international. So we saw a strong and accelerating 2-year contract for both Canada and other international. Is there any more color you can provide in terms of maybe what you're seeing in those geographies? Bob Nelson : I'm getting a little help here. It's more -- it's probably most is roguery, it's probably most about what how COVID impacted different countries differently. timing wise. I remember a year ago, a year and a half ago, some of the foreign countries did better while we were being locked down, and then later, they got locked down. And so part of it is one of the reasons I think everybody is picked up on the 2-year stack concept. But I think that's as much as anything that that's the reason. Rupesh Betti : Okay, great. And then as you look at your ancillary businesses, is there a way you can find an update as to how they're trending now versus pre-pandemic? Richard Galanti : I don't have that detail with me. But generally speaking, tires have picked up as an example of an ancillary business. But the Costco auto program is down because there's a shortage of cars out there. Travel is up not where it was pre it was almost back to where it was pre-COVID. And then delta variant hit. And then it was coming back again and then Omicron hit. So it fluctuates pretty quickly. Omicron though, and I'm trying to think the other things. Food courts have come back. Not I don't think they're quite where they were, but they're almost there. Hearing aids have come back. But still, I think slightly below pre-pandemic. Articles doing great. Pharmacy is doing great, helped, frankly, by the shots. We like other retail pharmacies, providing plenty of vaccines. Rupesh Betti : Okay, great. Thank you for all the color. Richard Galanti : Okay. Operator : For our next question, we have Stephanie Wissink from Jefferies. Stephanie, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good afternoon. This is Blake on for Steph. First question will be higher level, you guys are a big proponent of the in-store shopping experience. It seems like store sales have been fairly strong as of late for retailers. So wondering, how have your -- how's your in-ore shopping compared versus e-com versus your expectations recently? And then maybe if you can share any e-com pilots you might have that you've been working on? I know you mentioned you did a pickup test, but you discontinue that. Anything maybe in the works that you can share. Richard Galanti : Well, both in-store and online have picked up. The pickup from things like Instacart for same day fresh skyrocketed during the lock downs in mid to summer, mid to late summer 2020 came down from those peaks, but it's still way above where it was pre-COVID. E-commerce is as you know, because we talk about every quarter is 8% or 9% of our sales on that company. There's $192 billion in sales for the year ended this last August. So that's a lot bigger than it was. 2 years ago, well I think in the last 3 or 4 quarters, the 2 year taxes 100% plus. But notwithstanding that, and part of that is the big and bulky that has helped that number, which we really weren't driving that kind of business in-store anyway. The fact that I think that as we've heard occasionally that notwithstanding some people don't like our mask requirements when we first put them in back in May of 2020, I think overall people felt if I've got to go out I'm going to go out to one place and [indiscernible] stuff. And with taller ceilings and wider aisles and all those things, I got to believe that psychologically that's helped a little bit. At the end of the day, we were all surprised by [indiscernible] March of 2020, we're surprised by the strength in non-foods categories, summer and fall of 2020, much less now -- much the same now. It was because people weren't travelling, and they weren't going to games and concerts, but they were buying things for their home. And we certainly had on top of all the food items, all the other things they could buy for their home. So that was a pleasant surprise to us and that's continued. In terms of other tests, not a whole lot. I mean, we did have that small test in New Mexico with buy online and pick up in store. [Indiscernible] as I mentioned on the call, we have over -- a year from now have over 200 of our U.S warehouses with lockers. In terms of buying online, pick up in store, we're not quite sure about that. We have very busy locations, there's not a lot of room for it. And it doesn't seem to be a lot of people clamoring [indiscernible] or half the people that come in and do that on a few things that we buy online and the lockers, they come in and shop while they're there. And so that's what we want. So beyond that, I don't think -- I think some of the things we're doing that I mentioned briefly about mobile and digital, some of these things everybody else have, we are sometimes late to the game on some of these things. But those are -- should be on that additive to what we do. Unidentified Analyst : That's super helpful. I was also wondering on your inventory positioning. How much are you getting ahead of, any seasonal items, or any challenges you may foresee for Q2 and Q3 for the spring and summer? Richard Galanti : I don't know exactly. I know that consciously they -- the buyers when they presented the budget meetings or talking about those issues, we are bringing in things early. We certainly have -- you think about it, what we call our depot, our view of distribution system in the U.S was something like 10 million square feet. And we essentially slightly more than double that with the Innovel acquisition, aside from other things that helps us with a little storage if we needed or bringing in things early. Recognizing we start with we are somewhat seasonal, but historically volleys brought things in early anyway. So we've -- whatever it may be, we certainly have the cash, as somebody mentioned earlier, to have some extra billion dollars invested in inventory, even if it hangs around for a little bit. But I think overall, some of our items are still a little later than they would be pre-COVID. But better than they would be if we were not doing as good a job as I think we are doing on forward buying. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. If I could sneak one last one in. I might have missed it, but I think you said for the net new openings this year, you said 19. I thought the last quarter you were aiming more towards 25. Is there anything to call out? Richard Galanti : When I said it was 19 more in the last three quarters of the year, fiscal year, plus the [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : For our next question, we have Paul Lejuez from Citi. Paul, your line is open. Brandon Cheatham : Hey, everyone, this is Brandon Cheatham for Paul. I was wondering if we could talk about the increase in CapEx. I think last we spoke we thought CapEx would have a [indiscernible] front of it. Now it sounds like it's -- it has a four in front of it. I'm just wondering, is there a change in the strategy there? And specifically on the e-com investments, do you feel like you're playing some catch up there or laying the groundwork for growth, just anything that you can share with that? Richard Galanti : Sure. I think previous as relates to this year, we had talked about, I think 3.8 to 4.2 quote unquote, now we're saying about four. These numbers are up from the mid threes over the last couple of year, low to mid threes over the last couple of years. In fact, last year's 3.6 included a $340 million or $345 million asset purchase that I mentioned earlier in the Southwest, in Southern California, which is basically a 1.5 million plus square foot facility with lots of acreage to help with our fulfillment as well as our import stuff. And so I think there's, if you said what are the big things take you from the low threes to the low fours over a few years a period, it's more international expansions, which tends to be a little more expensive for location, more expansion, we -- in fiscal '20, we were down to 13 net new units because some delays with COVID. I think we were 20 and 21 and we're going to be 27 net new units this fiscal year. plus five relos, which is -- six relos planned. We might miss that a little bit. But at the end of the day, so there's more warehouses. Clearly more in the whole fulfillment concept, starting with the $1 billion acquisition a year ago of what's now Costco Logistics, starting with adding additional square footage to that, as well as the international things. And even on the distribution side, or what we call our cross stock depots, spending money overseas now in some of these countries to do some of that in a better way. Actually building a mini depot in Hawaii, where we have five locations? Seven, I'm sorry. Seven locations, but huge volume locations. And with a -- so we\u2019ve gotten to the volume and efficiency there that these are good investments. So it's a lot of those things. Mind you, we still spend all in close to a $1 billion a year here in IT. Brandon Cheatham : Got it. And it's how we should kind of think about it going forward long-term? Richard Galanti : That's -- by the way, that's not all CapEx, that's expenses, go ahead I'm sorry. Brandon Cheatham : And the 4 billion range is what we should think about CapEx for the long-term. Richard Galanti : I don't know for the long-term, I think four sounds about right for the next year or two. And if things continue to grow well -- go well and grow well, maybe goes up from there a little bit. But we're not looking to spend it if we don't think we have good things to spend it on just because our cash flow has been exceeding net income plus -- our cash flow has been exceeding regular dividend plus capital expenditures, and the like. Brandon Cheatham : Got it. And you also mentioned that you're able to change our products, when you're faced with shortages. I was wondering if you could quantify that versus kind of a normal quarter. And if you are switching out more than usual, what impact does that have on consumer behavior there, anything on the logistic side as well? Richard Galanti : I think it's -- I don't have the exact number, but my guess is it's a small low to mid single-digit percentage. What it means though is when back -- going back all the way back to spring of 2020 and there were -- people were hoarding goods. We were going out to additional suppliers to see what we can get recognizing from their perspective, it creates a new relationships, which will honor. You only forward not just for the three months that we [indiscernible]. And so I think there were opportunities to just expand product brands by necessity into some things, and with I think the -- going into last summer and fall with that advent of all the things for the home, both patio furniture and [indiscernible] and barbecue grills and indoor furniture and electronics and gadgets for the kitchen, we took advantage of that and brought in additional items. And so it's more of that than anything. And the treasure hunt, yes. So it's still a small piece, but I think it's -- when I sometimes -- when I go into some retailers, I'm not going to go into any names, but you'll see a shelf half empty or some spaces. First of all, once you put something in there and but at the end of the day, I think our buyers have done a very good job of keeping the warehouses full. Brandon Cheatham : Okay. Thanks, and good luck for holiday. Operator : For our next question, we have Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Edward, your line is open. Edward Kelly : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Happy holidays. Richard, I wanted to ask you gross margin [technical difficulty] considered. Any additional thoughts that you can share current quarter [technical difficulty] reason we should expect some incremental [technical difficulty] somewhat similar. Richard Galanti : You're breaking up entirely during that call. So I heard about every other word, if you want to repeat yourself. Edward Kelly : Yes, sorry. So I wanted to ask you about the gross margin. As you said, pretty good all things considered, any additional thoughts you can share on the current quarter? Comparisons in the core looks similar I think. Just wondering if there's any reason we should expect any incremental pressure. Richard Galanti : From a competitive standpoint, I mean, there's lots of -- everybody is competitive. Again, I think structurally our model allows us to [indiscernible] that. We talked about more pennies per gallon of profit that allows us to do some other things. I think we've got a -- I think we have a lot of levers to pull here. And we feel pretty good that we are able to hold the prices on key items. And to -- I don't really think that we consider the challenge of achieving a margin. We're pretty good at figuring out how to get there, while still being the company we are in terms of competitiveness. So no big changes of what we see out there. Edward Kelly : Okay. Richard Galanti : Just there's a lot of changes every month, and some things go up and some things go down. But overall, we feel pretty good about it. Edward Kelly : All right. And then just [indiscernible] for a little bit more big picture just around customer data. I was hoping maybe you could just provide an update on things like personalization. And then media is something that we hear a lot of people talk about, maybe just any thoughts on what you're doing with that opportunity as well. Richard Galanti : I think there's still low hanging fruit on the tree here. We've talked about it a little bit, we've done a little bit more targeting than we have ever done, but very little, there is more to come. It was just a year and a half ago, that we hired someone at a relatively senior level in terms of data analytics. But that's not the only thing they're working on. And they're -- that group that he's put together. But so I think those are things that will come over time in the next few years. That's pretty much what I can tell you about that. Edward Kelly : Okay, thank you. Richard Galanti : Okay. I'm going to take two more questions, [indiscernible]. Operator : And for the next question, we have Laura Champine from Loop Capital. Laura, your line is open. Laura Champine : Thanks, Richard. [Indiscernible], it's a follow-on. I mean, you'd mentioned that renewal rates are still headed higher in part because of likely because of the auto renew. What percentage of your membership is on auto renew at this point? Richard Galanti : It's about 50 in the U.S and Canada, which would imply and that's where we have the co-brand cards. And U.S and Canada is about 80% of our company. So the 50 be-comes a 40 if you, rough numbers. Laura Champine : Got it. Richard Galanti : Oh, I\u2019m sorry, you can do it on any card, not just co-brand. But in the U.S and Canada it's about 50. Laura Champine : Understood. Thank you so much. Operator : And for our last question, we have Kelly Bania from BMO Capital, Kelly, your line is open. Kelly Bania : Oh, thanks for squeezing me in here. Just wanted to talk Richard about the -- just the inflationary environment. And you've talked a little bit in the past couple quarters about how your price gaps have widened. Do you think this kind of magnitude of inflation is just good for Costco's business? I mean, have you seen anything like this in the past where it could possibly just drive even more volume into your doors? Richard Galanti : I mean, from an argument that things are more costly. On the one hand, maybe it reduces demand overall, on the sense that we're the extreme value proposition that helps us. So who the heck knows. I think I was reading this morning and the paper was -- this is the highest inflation in so many years. Wasn't that long ago, though, 10 plus years ago that regular inflation was 2% or 3% a year. And of course, it's going to be a little more right for a year. But at the end of the day, I think it helps us a little, because of the value proposition that we have. Kelly Bania : That makes sense. And a lot has been asked here, but just wanted to also just check on self checkout and where you are with that. And if there's any color, you can help us understand on the savings or the impact on the cost structure when you put in some self checkout and the potential for that initiative going forward. Richard Galanti : We pretty much have it now in most locations. And I'm speaking of the U.S. and Canada. And I know even across the street in many locations, we've expanded it from originally, two lanes of three or six to three lanes of three or even four lanes of three. So in a four lane area, you could have 12 people checking out. And so my guess is still going to grow a little as we expand existing units to offer a little bit more of it. And it's been a positive. Kelly Bania : Okay, thank you. Richard Galanti : Well, thank you everyone and have a good holiday season and we're around to answer additional questions. Have a good day.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Jerome, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.  In today's press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal '22, the 12 weeks ended this past February 13, as well as February retail results for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, February 27.  Net income for the quarter came in at $1,299 million or $2.92 per diluted share. Last year's second quarter net income came in at $951 million or $2.14 per diluted share. That latter number included a $246 million pretax or $0.41 per share costs, incurred primarily from COVID-19 premium wages.  Net income for the 24 weeks was $2.62 billion or $5.90 per share compared to $2.12 billion or $4.76 per diluted share last year in the first half. Net sales for the quarter increased 16.1% to $50.94 billion, up from $43.89 billion last year in the second quarter. Comparable sales in the second quarter for fiscal '22, on a reported basis, U.S. sales increase during the 12-week period was 15.8%, excluding gas inflation, 11.3%; Canada, 16% reported, 12.4% ex-gas inflation and FX; other International, 6.2%; and plus 9% ex-gas inflation and FX for the total company reported number of 14.4% on a same-store comparable basis and up 11.1%, excluding gas inflation effects. E-commerce, on a reported basis, up 12.5% and FX, up 12.6%.  In terms of our second quarter comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 9.3% worldwide and up 8.3% year-over-year in the quarter in the United States. Our average transaction or ticket was up 4.6% worldwide and up 6.9% in the U.S. during the second quarter. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 60 basis points, while gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 390 basis points. I will review our February sales results later in the call.  Going down our second quarter fiscal 2022 income statement. Membership fee income reported came in at $967 million, up $86 million or up 9.8% from a year earlier, $881 million. There was about a $6.5 million impact -- negative impact due to FX. So on an ex FX basis, if you will, the $86 million increase would have been up $92 million or 10.4%.  In terms of renewal rates, they continue to increase. At second quarter-end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate stood at 92.0%, up 0.4 percentage point from the 12-week earlier Q1 end. And worldwide rate, it came in at 89.6%, up 0.6% from where it stood 12 weeks earlier at Q1 end. Our renewal rates are continuing to benefit from more members' auto renewing as well as increased penetration of executive members who on average renew at a higher rate than nonexecutive members, and higher first year renewal rates for our new members. In terms of the number of members at second quarter-end, member households and total cardholders. Total households was $63.4 million, up 900,000 from the $62.5 million just 12 weeks earlier. And total cardholders at Q2 end, $114.8 million, up $1.7 million from the $113.1 million figure 12 weeks ago.  At second quarter-end, paid executive memberships stood at $27.1 million, an increase of $644,000 during the 12-week period since Q1 end. Executive members, by the way, represent now 42.7% of our total membership base and 70.9% of our total sales.  Moving down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the second quarter was lower year-over-year by 32 basis points, but up 5 basis points, excluding gas inflation. As I always do, I'll ask you to judge on a few numbers, two columns. The first column is reported, the second column would be excluding gas inflation. First line item, merchandise - core merchandise on a reported basis was down 75% -- 75 basis points year-over-year and ex gas inflation, down 43 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses reported plus 40 basis points and ex gas inflation, plus 49 basis points, 2% reward, plus 3 and minus 1 basis points; LIFO, minus 14 and minus 14 basis points; other plus 14 and plus 14 basis points. So totally, on a reported basis, again, year-over-year, minus 32 basis points and excluding gas inflation, plus 5 basis points. Now in terms of the core merchandise component being lower by 75% year-over-year reported and 43 -- minus 43 basis points ex gas inflation. Recall last year in Q2 that the core reported was plus 71 basis points in ex gas plus 63, so still improved to where we were two years ago, prepandemic and ex gas. In terms of the core margin on its own sales, in Q2, our core-on-core margin, if you will, was lower by 28 basis points year-over-year. Approximately 2/3 of this coming from fresh foods and a little from foods and sundries and nonfoods as well.  Fresh continues to lap exceptional labor productivity and low product spoilage that occurred from the outside sales a year ago in the second quarter. Ancillary and other business gross margin was higher by 40 basis points and by 49 ex gas in the quarter. Gas travel, business centers and pharmacy were all better year-over-year, offset by e-comm and optical. LIFO, we had a 14 basis point hit year-over-year to LIFO, or $71 million LIFO charge during the quarter, both with and without gas inflation. Recall that our Q1 LIFO charge year-over-year was $14 million or in the first quarter was $14 million or a 3 basis point delta versus the prior year.  It's been the last three fiscal quarters that we've actually pointed out LIFO as we saw a little bit of inflation going back to December or Q4 of fiscal '21, a little more in Q1 of this fiscal year. And as with everything you read in the news, quite a bit more in Q2. Our 2% reward was higher on a reported basis by 3% and minus 1%, excluding gas inflation, a reflection of increased penetration of the 2% reward executive members and other was plus 14 basis points year-over-year. This is related to the COVID-related costs from a year ago, about $60 million. That's the portion of COVID-related wages that go into cost of sales that like related to manufacturing businesses as well as their meat and bakery departments. Overall, a pretty good showing on the gross margin, given the ongoing and increasing inflationary pressures. Moving to expenses, to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the second quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 94 basis points, and better by 63 basis points, excluding gas inflation, Again, jotting down two columns of numbers reported and the second one, ex gas inflation. Operations, plus 36 basis points and plus 9. Here, a plus is good. It means it's lower year-over-year. Central, plus 13, plus 10; stock compensation, plus 3 and plus 2; other, plus 42 and plus 42, for a total of plus 94 and plus 63. So better or lower by 94 basis points reported and better or lower by 63 basis points ex gas inflation. Now again, looking at the first line item, operations. The core operations component, better again by 36, but as well better by 9 or lower by 9 basis points, excluding the impact of gas inflation. Keep in mind that this improvement occurred despite both the permanent dollar an hour wage increase that began in March of 2021 is now anniversary-ing and the additional starting wage increases from our 2 basic hourly scale service assisted and services by an additional $0.50 an hour, that occurred in October of 2021.  Central, better by 13 basis points or 10 ex gas inflation. It's pretty straightforward operating leverage on strong sales figures. Stock comp, plus 2 and plus 2, again, a reflection of good sales. And other, this plus 42 basis points, this was the $2 COVID wages of $186 million that goes into SG&A in Q2 a year ago. So again, on a year-over-year basis, that was that improvement.  In terms of preopening expenses in past conference calls, really since we went public, I think, we've covered that preopening expenses next on this discussion. Starting this fiscal year, going forward, preopening is now included in SG&A. The year-over-year change in SG&A related to preopening was flat year-over-year, no basis point delta year-over-year in the second quarter. All told, reported operating income in Q2 increased 35% on a reported basis, coming in at $1,812 million this year compared to $1,340 million a year ago in the second quarter.  Below the operating income line, interest expense was $36 million this year versus $40 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $6 million year-over-year, $25 million this year versus $19 million last year, primarily due to favorable FX. Overall, reported pretax income in the quarter was up 37%, coming in at $1.801 billion compared to $1.319 billion a year earlier. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q2 was slightly higher than it was in Q2 a year ago. It came in at 26.7% compared to 26.4% a year ago in the second quarter. Our effective tax rate is currently -- it continues to be projected to be in the 26% to 27% range for the fiscal year.  A few other items of note. Warehouse expansion. For the year, we now plan to have 32 new units and 32 units, including 4 relocations. So replacing existing units to larger and better located facilities. So net total of 28. I think a quarter ago, we actually said it was a net total of 27, so 1 more than that. However, remember, several of these are slotted to open in Q4, our fiscal Q4, 1 of them or 14 net new. So there's always a potential for 1 of those to shift into the next fiscal year.  The five openings in Q2 that we had, one each in Mexico or 40th in Mexico, our second in France, our second in China, our fourth in Spain and 1 additional unit in Florida, where we now have 29 locations. Regarding capital expenditures, our Q2 spend for CapEx was approximately $723 million, and our full year CapEx spend is still estimated to be approximately $4.0 billion.  Moving on to e-commerce. E-commerce sales in Q2 ex FX, as I mentioned earlier, increased 12.6% year-over-year. And that's, of course, on top of a second quarter fiscal '21 increase of 75% increase last year, benefiting, of course, from COVID. Stronger departments in e-commerce in terms of year-over-year percentage increases, jewelry, tires, special or kiosk items, patio and garden and home furnishings. Our largest online merchandise department majors, which consists of consumer electronics, appliances, TVs, et cetera, was up in the high single digits on very strong sales increases a year earlier. In terms of an update on Costco Logistics, that continues to drive big and bulky sales for the quarter. Deliveries were up year-over-year, 22%, and now about 85% of our U.S. e-comm less than truckload shipments from Costco Logistics, we're doing ourselves. Average during the quarter, we averaged more than 65,000 stops per week with Costco Logistics, which translates into a little over $3 million planned drops in Costco Logistics for the fiscal year.  In terms of e-comm and mobile apps, it continues to improve, much improved layout the ability to view warehouse receipts online, the ability to reschedule e-com deliveries in the U.S. and Canada as well as reschedule returns pickups. Later this month, we'll have our warehouse inventory along with the Instacart inventory online, and be able to see all the detail of our in-line in-store merchandise as well. In terms of our e-commerce platform, Costco Next, we added a few additional suppliers. So we now have 37 suppliers online and growing. Again, Costco Next has about 1,000 items on it, curated items at Costco Values. Please give it a -- check it out.  From a supply chain perspective, similar issues that we outlined, both 12 and 24 weeks ago on the past quarterly earnings calls, the factors pressuring supply chains and inflation include port delays, container shortages, COVID disruptions, shortages of various components and raw materials and ingredients and supplies, labor cost pressures, of course, as well as truck and driver shortages. Overall, we've done a pretty good job of giving the supply chain challenges. I think that's evidenced in our sales strength. They continue to be delayed to container arrivals, so we continue to advance order in many cases as we are able to. Virtually all departments are impacted, less product and packaging challenges, but still a few. Still some limitations on key items, but again, that's improving a little. Chip shortages are still 1 of the things that are impacting many items, some more than others. But again, we're managing temporal and driving sales.  One of the things that we've done that I mentioned last quarter, I mentioned we had chartered 3 small container vessels to help provide us with additional flexibility on shipping. We have now charged a total of 7 ocean vessels, up from those 3 -- for the next 3 years. And these are the transport 'containers between Asia and the U.S. and Canada. We've also leased containers for use in these ships. With these additions, about 1/4 of our annual trans-Pacific containers and shipment needs are being accommodated this way, which gives us additional supply chain flexibility.  Despite all the supply chain issues, we're staying in stock and continue to work to mitigate cost and price increases as best we can. From every day and every week, you're going to see in different items in different departments, certain things on allocation or short, but other things are filling its place. And again, some things are seeming to get a little better.  Moving to inflation. Inflation, of course, continues, as evidenced by our LIFO charge. The inflationary pressures that we and others continue to see include higher labor costs, higher freight costs as well as higher transportation demand. Along with the container shortages and port lays that I just mentioned. Increased demand in certain product categories, various shortages of everything from computer chips to oils chemicals to resins.  Higher commodity prices from foodservice oils to additives and motor oils to plastics to detergents to paper products as well on the fresh side, proteins and butter and eggs and things like that. Not very different than what you hear and read and see from others. But again, we think we've done a pretty good job of corralling it as best we can.  For first quarter, a quarter ago, I mentioned that we estimated, at that time, overall price inflation to have been in the 4.5% to 5% range for the second quarter and talking with senior merchants, estimated overall price inflation was in the 6% range. All of this said, again, I want to give another shout-out to the job that our merchants and our traffic department and operators have all been able to do to keep -- in order to keep the products that we need pivot when and where necessary, keep our warehouses full like keeping prices as low as we can for our members and continue to show great value versus our competitors.  Now turning to our February sales results, the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 27, compared to the same 4-week period a year ago. As reported in our release, net sales for the month of February came in at $16.29 billion, an increase of 15.9% from $14.05 billion a year earlier. Recall from January sales results that Lunar New Year, Chinese New Year occurred on February 1. That's 11 days earlier this past -- this year than last. This shift negatively impacted February's Other International by about 4 percentage points? And total company by about 0.5? Percentage point. Comparable sales for the 4 weeks on a reported basis, U.S. was 17.4%, ex gas and FX 12.9%; Canada reported 11.7%, ex gas and FX 8.8; Other international, minus 0.9% and ex gas and FX, a 1.3% to the positive. Total company, 14% and 10.6%, and e-comm within that number is 10.2% reported and 10.4% ex gas and FX.  Our comp traffic and frequency for February was up 8% worldwide and 8.2% in the United States. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar negatively impacted total and comp sales as follows : Canada by approximately 0.2%, Other International by approximately 4.5% and total company by approximately 0.7%. Gas price inflation positively impacted total reported comps by about 4% and average worldwide selling price per gallon was up year-over-year by 37%.  Worldwide, the average transaction for February was up 5.5%. Our U.S. regions with the strongest sales were Texas, the Southeast and the Northeast. Other international and local currencies saw the strongest results in Australia, Mexico and the U.K.  Moving to merchandise highlights for the month of February. Food and synergies was -- came in at a positive high single digits, fresh foods in the mid-single digits and nonfoods and deposit of high single digits. Ancillary businesses sales were up mid-40s and with gas being certainly a driver of that as well as food court and hearing aids were the top performers.  With that, I want to mention just a couple of recent executive changes. A month ago, we reported that Ron Vachris became President of Costco. Ron started his career 39 years ago at Price Company and Price Club at the young age of 17. Most of his career was in operations through 2015. Then he spent a little over a year in real estate traveling the world and working on both worldwide and domestic expansion. And since that time, in 2016 has been in merchandising with certainly responsibly, not only for in-line merchandising, but online merchandising as well as very involved with logistics and transportation. As well, just this week, internally, we reported that taking Ron's previous spot is Head of Merchandising is Claudine Adamo. Claudine has been with us for 30 years. She began in an hourly position in our Kirkland warehouse in 1992, 30 years ago. But a year later, he came into buying and has been buying ever since and most recently was Senior VP of nonfood sales -- of nonfoods merchandising. And again, he'll be taking over -- looking overall of merchandising. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our March sales results for the 5 weeks ending April 3, on Sunday, April 3, on Wednesday, April 6 after the markets close.  With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back to Jerome. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael Lasser : Good afternoon. Richard, thanks a lot for taking my question. First one is on the fee increase for the potential for a fee increase. if there is no increase this year, should the market interpret that as some reflection of how Costco - either? I think power, especially in light of companies like Amazon and Netflix raising their fees this year? Or should we interpret a sign as the interval with Costco [indiscernible] Richard Galanti : Well, certainly, I don't think you should interpret anything related to why or when. Historically, we always look at things like do we feel we can -- we look at ourselves in the mirror, do we feel that we've continued to increase the value of the membership. Certainly, we look at renewal rates we look less at what others do, frankly, but certainly is out there what others are doing. And what I do note is that I looked at the last three increases over the last 15 years, and on average, they were done about every 5.5 -- a little over every 5.5 years, about five years and seven months. And five years from the anniversary of the June of '17 would be this June. So I think the question will continue to be asked until we do or don't do something. But at the end of the day, we certainly feel very good about our member loyalty our success in getting members to move to executive member, which are the most loyal. And so you guys will know when we tell you, and at some point, it will happen, but stay tuned. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is on the core-on-core gross margin. Over the last couple of quarters, you've given back about 1/3 of the core-on-core gross margin gains at Costco during the hardest times like over probably the last couple of years. Is this the right way to think about what's sustainable from here? You may give back 1/3 [indiscernible]. Alternatively, would you expect your growth? Richard Galanti : Yes. Yes. Look, recognizing -- I'd like to think it was that easy that we could plan it and get there. Sometimes we get there, but 10 different variables go in 10 different directions than we had planned. There's lots of moving parts to it. The fact of the matter is we certainly have confidence in our competitive position and our confidence to get some margin as we go forth.  The fact of the matter is, our margins -- our gross margins are still even on core-on-core higher than they were two years ago. We had outsized margins two years ago, most particularly in fresh. When you had 20% and 30% increases in fresh, you darn near eliminated spoilage and \u2013 where are the 2s. Labor - you improved dramatically labor productivity in fresh. And you darn near eliminated all your spoilage. Some of that's not sustainable. So -- but even with some of the giveback, if you will, on a two-year stack, if you will, we've -- we're still showing higher year-over-year numbers on core-on-core.  The other thing is as we've said, and we don't sit around and just pound our chest on it. Despite these inflationary pressures, we've tried to hold where we can. Now needless to say you can't do that in near in its entirety. -- but we've probably been a little later than others in terms of raising some things in our view. We've worked with our suppliers to eat a little of it and we eat a little of it. And I think that these margins, particularly given the sales strength and the operating leverage, allow us to be ever more competitive and drive our business.  So when asked the question, as many of you know, over the years, who's our toughest competitor? It's us. And I don't really look at this as being a reflection of what's going on there. We're ever competitive. We're always checking our competition, and we feel that, that competitive - our competitive position is as strong as ever. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Richard, I'd like to follow up on the core-on-core question just asked differently. About, I could say, a year ago, supply chain costs were rising, input costs are rising, and it felt like you were not ahead of it. And in the last two quarters, it seems like you're now more ahead of it. You feel better. You called out the two-year trend in the core on core. So does it feel like we are past the worst and that you're able to either move pricing or have some visibility on supply chain?  And then related to the perishable piece, it sounds like you're going to keep some efficiencies. So there is a reason to believe that some of this, you will keep going forward? I don't know if that's fair or not. Richard Galanti : Yes certainly, on the fresh and the fact that we're at higher sales levels, that allows for higher labor productivity and hopefully a little lower D&D or spoilage. I don't disagree with what you say, but there's -- never know what's going to happen tomorrow. I know that for 35 years, when things get better, we figure out how to give a little more of it back. And certainly, right now, with all the inflation, first and foremost, is getting merchandise on the shelves and then mitigating those various cost components as much as you can, which is not a lot. And again, but hopefully being as, if not a little more competitive than others. Simeon Gutman : And maybe a follow-up, I'd love to take on the price gaps out there. It feels like every company we cover in the mass space, supermarket space, they're all pleased with price gaps. And yet, I'm not sure -- I don't know if that's right or wrong, and we're seeing gross margins actually start to go up in some places. So it seems like companies, your competition, they're taking price, that would imply that the gaps actually should be widening and making you more valuable. Curious, I know you guys have folks running around stores a lot. Curious what's your take on it? Richard Galanti : Well, we like when they feel more comfortable, frankly. Look, our most direct competitor is Sam's. We -- and I'm sure they do to do comp shops every week in every \u2013 darn near every location. We feel good about those gaps. It's not that they've widened or shrunk that overall, they're a tough competitor, and so are we.  As it rates to other traditional, yes, you've seen -- I think we've called out strength in gas business. I think overall, what I read externally about gross margins in retail gas by the supermarkets and others is up. And there's a little bit more -- that gives us breathing room as well. But we want to be ever more competitive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jack Grom from Gordon Haskett. Charles Grom : Richard. Over the past few months, you guys have had success raising retails. And I'm wondering if that trend has continued? Or if you're starting to see some limits or demand destruction in any parts of the club. Richard Galanti : Not no, and we haven't. I think certainly, the more inflation creates some demand pressure. I'd like to think some of that inflation or wanting to shop across and save more frankly. But we haven't seen that. Charles Grom : Okay. Okay. Great. And then just another near-term question. Historically, I'm wondering if with gas prices where they are and where they're likely to go. I heard today, California is close to $5. Historically, has there really been a tipping point? And how it impacts traffic for you guys? I understand how it impacts the margin structure of your business, but historically, is there a tipping point for you? Richard Galanti : We haven't seen that. The only time in my recollection is a number of years ago, when prices got to $4, $5, Alan, and like then and now, we see our gallons improve relatively speaking because we're still the cheapest game. At some point, if it goes to 5 people stop driving a little bit, it's hard to state. I'd like to think that the hybrid models of working has helped a little bit there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi. Brandon Cheatham : This is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. I was wondering, are you seeing any change in consumer behavior such as trade down or maybe trade to private label brands anything of that nature? Richard Galanti : It's interesting. On the one hand, the only thing I can think of is in fresh when there's been big fluctuations in prices or big increase in prices on beef relative to chicken or something, you'll see some trade down within the protein family. Other than that, a couple of anomalies that are perverse in the sense that it's almost just the opposite. We've seen strength in jewelry and in big-ticket furniture items and the like. And more conversions to executive membership, which, again, there's more value long term to that customer, but it's adding $60 to their fee. SP-7 Got it. Brandon Cheatham : And just a point of clarification on price inflation. Has that moderated the past couple of months as I think some of your monthly updates have indicated? Or are you still seeing that accelerate? Richard Galanti : Has not moderated. It continues to go up. Brandon Cheatham : Got it. Richard Galanti : Now it's going up perhaps at a little less so. The bigger slope was probably 4 to 2 months ago, and it's gone up from there. I think if I recall, there was a little low -- talking to the buyers a little low in the last couple of months of the year. But many suppliers are already talking back 2 months prior to that to come January, we'll be coming back and talking to you again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Securities. Scot Ciccarelli : So Richard, you guys are running with nearly double the cash balance that you historically would have run with kind of prepandemic. Obviously, there's still a lot of uncertainty in the market I guess the question is because we've seen this pattern for probably 8-plus quarters now to continue to run with much higher cash levels than what you historically have. Or should we start thinking about the potential return of capital to shareholders like you've done periodically? Richard Galanti : Well, at some point, we'll figure out what to do. And mind you, our Q2 balance sheet, Q 2 and balance sheet is probably the highest point from a seasonal standpoint because you've built a lot of sales and you still have some of the bills to pay from the Christmas time, not a lot, but some. And frankly, knock on wood, our operating cash flow has certainly exceeded what we had expected 2 years ago. So yes, there is a little more. At some point, certainly, one of the arrows in our quiver is a special dividend along with the regular dividend increase that we've done every year, as well as some stock buybacks.  But first and foremost is CapEx. CapEx this year of $4-ish plus million is up from the $3 million, $3.5 million over the last couple of years and up from numbers lower than that, the 2 to 4 years prior to that. So that's, first and foremost, what we want to spend money on. But we've done 4 specials and as one of the Board members said as we are a little quirky and it seems to have worked for us. So it's certainly an arrow in a quiver, but we haven't made any decision at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Karen Short : I just wanted to ask the membership fee question a little differently. So in the past, you've talked about raising the membership fee in the context that you obviously have an inflow of dollars to then reinvest in price. So I guess the question is, maybe with the assumption that consumer is going to continue to feel a little more and more stretched as the year progresses, how does that factor into your thought process? And then also tying that in with the fact that there was obviously the increase in membership at Amazon. Richard Galanti : I think we -- that doesn't hurt, but at the -- honestly, at the end of the day, first and foremost, the factors that doesn't give us any concerns is the fact that our sales are strong. Our renewal rates and loyalty are at all-time highs. So that's all positive. And yes, when we do it, we use it to be even more competitive. So on the one hand, you might argue that because of inflation would this allow us to mitigate some of that. We're already doing that, by the way, without a fee increase. But we've done it 7 times in 35 years, and sometime between summer and 6 or 9 months down the road, is it likely? It's possible, but we'll have to wait and see. But we don't really consider what with Amazon or what we were asked the question the other way with some of our direct warehouse club competitors that theirs is -- they have not changed their in a number of years. And that does not concern us either. We look at what we're doing, how it affects our members -- and we look at ourselves in the Americas have we improved the value of the membership. And we've always felt that we've done that in a more dramatic fashion in these increases. And then we take those increases and use it to become even more competitive. So I cannot give you an answer other than we feel good about if and when we want to do it, we'll be able to Karen Short : Okay. And then my second question is just on the net income margin, or I guess you could talk about pretax margin. Obviously, that has come up quite a bit over the last several years. And I think the question on a lot of people's mind is just is there more of a willingness to flow through margin on that line? And I know, again, you don't run your business that way. You run it for [indiscernible] and volume and leverage on strong comps, but just wondering how you would frame that? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, certainly in this quarter as well, the bottom line margin improvement was the sum of great expense improvement and some margin detriment, I'm taking out all the anomalies of each. And that's the way we want to do it. The old saying is we want to lower prices and raise margins. Same thing is we want to improve the bottom line while not raising prices. And I'm not talking about necessarily specific inflation right now. I think I recall a few of these -- of you on the call might remember this when we had our made first and last all hands all meeting out here with about 300 people.  And at the time, we had a 2.8% pretax return on sales, pretax. And our founder was up there saying that we're a great company and great companies deserve to make good money. And over the next several years, we wanted to go from 2.8 to a number. I won't get everybody excited, but a bigger number. And at the end of the day, it went up and down, but it has improved. I think that -- we got a lot of great things going on. We're not embarrassed to make money for our shareholders as well, but we're going to do it within the confines of being ever more competitive from a pricing and value standpoint to our members. Operator : Your next question goes from the line of Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Christopher Horvers : I guess my first question is, do you look at the U.S. sort of core comp on a 2- and 3-year basis? Really, since the summer, there's been a bit more volatility to the 2 and 3 year trends even over the past few months, do you read into that? How much do you think that was maybe just like a holiday shift, maybe some Omicron impact in January. Curious how you're thinking about that. Richard Galanti : It would be the all-inclusive yes. It's all of the above. I remember when we had particularly strong early in the Christmas holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas holiday season. We had strength. Part of that was bringing in some things early. Part of it was this increased demand that COVID has created for goods for the home and the shortages of those same goods. And so once they hit the shelves, you sold quickly.  And then, of course, it was a little -- it was still positive, but a little less than that trend at the end of the calendar year. And without doing a lot of work, it seemed like that was the reason. Then you've got storms that affect the things. You've got shifts and things like Chinese and Lunar New Year. We really don't spend a lot of time doing that. We try to understand why overall something -- some level of sales either generally reduced increase, we don't worry about it as much. And -- but I don't think we spend a lot of time thinking about that. We're -- as we've been reminded from the day of our founding, we're a top line company and it's all about driving sales and value. And it's going to be as good as we can get it. And -- so we don't read a lot into what you asked. Christopher Horvers : Got it. It's a good segue. I guess your executive trends, the renewal rates, the comps, the traffic you're one of the few big retailers with really strong traffic. But at the same time, is there a point where just the culture becomes uncomfortable with passing through price? I mean the vendors have talked about more price increases that have come starting January 1. It seems like there's more coming in September. I could think of Jim sort of being paranoid and worried about do we just push too far and do we not want to risk that and invest more in price before even seeing any deterioration in the sales trends? Richard Galanti : I would say we're more aggressive when things are good, and -- we're aggressive when things are good and bad. I remember somebody years ago asked the question, given that sales for whatever reason, had been weak for a month or 2. And that was more the reason to be even more strong on pricing. And I think actually had related to a pending membership fee increase based on this kind of 5-plus year anniversary. And the view was, no, our members are loyal and we're going to use it to drive more sales. So no, I don't -- I think we're still boarded that same DNA of trying to constantly drive more value and not worry about how strong or weak we are today, just keep driving more value and if we keep focusing on that, nobody can catch us. Christopher Horvers : And just one quick one -- sorry, say that again? Richard Galanti : It's harder to catch us at least. Christopher Horvers : Yes. And then just a quick question on LIFO. If price increases have continued into this year, does that LIFO number should stay at this level? And as we lap through it, do we actually get that back? Richard Galanti : Well, in theory, you don't get it back. If -- as I said earlier, if inflation is continuing, you should see some additional LIFO charges, maybe not as big, but who knows. And at some point, at the beginning, as you start a new fiscal year, you've had whatever LIFO charge you'll have for this past year. And those -- that's kind of the new set point for costs for each item.  And then to the extent if there's additional inflation relative to that starting point, you'll have some additional IPO next year. If things came down a little bit, let's say things -- I'm making these numbers up in the extreme. But things were up in 1 year, 20% and the next year, they were down 10%. You had a big LIFO charge this year, and you actually have some LIFO credit in the following year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from DA Davidson. Michael Baker : Okay. I guess I'll stay on the inflation question, but ask 2 different inflation questions. One, if prices do come down, eventually, they will. Historically, what do you see in terms of your ability to maintain the comp prices, in other words, not to come down and then to gain some margin in that sense.  And then a second inflation-related question. Historically, when you see outsized inflation now it's been a long time since we've seen inflation like this, but you've been around for a long time. When you see inflation, do you get more customers coming in to Costco to save money? You alluded to that earlier, you said that's what you hope happens. But I guess I'm sure you've looked at it historically, what have you seen? Richard Galanti : On the Atlanta question, past history has indicated, yes, not in a big way, but the answer is yes, directionally. As it relates to if prices come down, if our costs come down, we want to be the first to lower the price, period. Michael Baker : Okay. That makes sense. One last one, if I could. Similar to that, do you get more customers on in an inflationary environment. Do you see more customers wanting to sign up to take advantage of your value in a tougher economic situation? In other words, in 2022, no stimulus does appear as if the economy might not be or at least the consumer economy might not be as strong as last year. How does that impact your memberships or renewal rates? Richard Galanti : I think if you asked us two years ago, how would the next two years be in terms of new member sign-ups, we would be positive. But we probably have achieved greater than those expected -- than our own expectations, by a little. And so arguably that it was not just the stimulus, but notwithstanding the stimulus, there wasn't a lot of positive feelings out there in terms of the consumer and we did just fine.  So one of the good things that we've been blessed with that we are the extreme value proposition, and it generally bodes well for us in good and bad economic times. And so I think we don't pay a lot of attention to it other than really being focused on driving price and value of our products and services and taking care of the customer and then the rest seems to work. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So I had a question just on the labor front. I was just curious what you guys are seeing from a labor availability standpoint? And then what your comfort is with your wage levels in the marketplace, just given we continue to see others raise their wages? Richard Galanti : Well, we continue to raise them as others have, and we will continue to do that. The biggest single area of challenge is, one, we're headquartered in Seattle, which has become an increasingly expensive market. And within that, IT, where you not only have 3 big-hits, but the next 3 tech behemoths all have 10,000 to 20,000 employees in this town as well. So we've had to raise wages there and didn't happen overnight in the last 2 weeks. It's happened continually over the last couple of years. And we will also lose a few people because we're not 100% work from home. We have a -- we think, a good fair hybrid work model. But for some -- a few, they want that. Overall, though, if you look at our total compensation and benefits package, 90% of our employees are hourly in the warehouse. And we -- while maybe there's a city or 2 where we've got to occasionally start it 1 step above the entry level, we've continued to raise the wages, as I mentioned in the thing and we'll do it again. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Great. And then maybe 1 additional question. Just on the ancillary front, if you can just remind us where you are with your recovery versus pre-pandemic and some of the more challenged categories travel, food core, et cetera? Richard Galanti : Yes. Well, the biggest one is gas, and that's gone nothing but up. And again, as I mentioned earlier, the retail competitive price pressure is probably lessened over the last couple of years. TravelU mentioned is 1 that has been extreme ups and downs. There was a period during the mid-2020 year lockouts -- as COVID lockouts, where we had negative -- we had lost money in the business and had negative revenues because you're getting more cancellations and no new orders, and that fluctuate. It's come back. It fell a little bit with Delta. It came back after that. It fell a little bit with Omnicom, although now we seem to be upon the upward trend, and it is profitable, not as profitable as it was 2 years ago. but continue in that direction. Huge business and both vacation packages as well as auto renewal -- rental cars and the like.  So that's a business that's coming out nicely. It was businesses like where there's face-to-face touch, if you will, with -- in our hearing aid and optical shops. That was actually closed for a number of weeks in the mid-2020. But just for 10 or 15 weeks, I think, that's come back as well. Food courts have come back because we have shares in tables back out and we expanded the menu. So overall, a few of those ancillary business, they're not back to where they were, but they're getting there. And then, of course, the one business that dwarfs all the other is gas, just in its size and its increased profitability. So overall, ancillary is doing fine and some of the ones that were hurt the most are picking up. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Kelly Bania : Follow-up real quickly on the gas. Richard, you made the comment about gas margins going up kind of across the space. Can you help us understand a little bit about how Costco's gas margins are relative to 2019? Are they up, maybe just up a little less? And where are we with gallons versus 2019? Richard Galanti : I don't have that detail in front of me. Margins are up, prices are up, and it's a huge business. It's a little more than 10% of our sales. It's a $20-plus million business now. Recognizing there's been, as I mentioned earlier, a 30-plus percent increase in just the price per gallon. But it's definitely been up the last couple of years and it's less volatile than it was 5 and 10 years ago in terms of a big margin fluctuation. But I don't have the detail like 2 years ago. Kelly Bania : Okay. I'll just ask another one just on white space then, just in the U.S. Just curious if you can just give us an update on how you're looking at that today over the next couple of years, do you have to at all change your target demographics or target population density in terms of where you'll plan on opening up new clubs in the U.S., just the eventual number that you see, just an update there. Richard Galanti : Sure. I mean if you had asked me 5 years ago, how many -- 5 years hence or now how many -- what would it look like 5 years ago, we were opening about 25 a year, call it, 26 to make the math easy for a second. And maybe 70-30 U.S. and Canada, our most successful mature -- most mature markets. And then over the next 5 or 10 years, the 70-30 would probably go to 60-40 outside of the U.S. and Canada. And here we are 5 years into that incorrect answer, and we're pretty 65, 35 U.S. Canada for 2 reasons. Partly is our expectations of what we can do in the U.S. and Canada has increased, not just in the last 5 years, but in general, over many years; and it's taken a little longer the time lines internationally, although we've got more feet on the ground and more stuff looking. So if you ask me today, I look 5 years from now, we'll go from 65-35 or whatever excess today, probably down to 50-50 I think the good news with that answer from that perspective is, is that we feel we still have plenty of opportunities in the U.S. and Canada, and we've ramped up our activities to do more in these other countries where we've also been quite successful.  The -- if you said -- asked over the next 10 years, we're opening, I think, this year, 16 of our 28 are in the U.S. I could be off by 1 or 2. Our view is there's no reason to think for the next 10 years, we can't open 15-or-so a year in the U.S. Now mind you, 1 or 2 of those are growing to 2 or 3 will be the business centers. We now have 22 business centers in the U.S. and 5 in Canada. That's been a good adjunct to our business. But we're also -- and we're infilling I gave an example at an internal meeting yesterday, and I've given it before to you guys. In San Jose, about 4 or 5 years ago, we opened our fourth in the Greater San Jose market. At the time, the 3 units were doing about 250 each. Now the 4 units are averaging right at 300 each averaging. And on fewer members per location because you've got existing members driving less far, so there's a combination of infill. Now we're in 46 states, so there's not a lot of additional states. We're less penetrated versus our direct competitors in certain locations in the Midwest and Texas, South and parts of the Southeast, and we're still opening there as well. So it really is a combination of all those things. I think our view is the good news is that there's still -- we're far from saturating our most saturated markets. And we've upped the adding in terms of feet on the ground, the real estate feet on the ground, if you will, in terms of getting some more into the pipeline. Operator : Your next question as from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. John Heinbockel : Richard, first thing, philosophically, how do you guys think about closing the gap on the two membership tiers, right? Maybe encouraging some further conversion to executive. And I don't know if you've done any kind of work with your current executive members, what would they like in the membership that's not there today, right, that perhaps might just make it might help you take the monthly -- the annual fee higher. Richard Galanti : Yes. A lot, I don't know exactly what we ask. I need to ask our membership marketing people. I think we've frankly been very pleased of our success of getting more existing -- more new members -- more existing members to convert and frankly, more new members to sign up initially as an executive. Mind you, 8 or 10 years ago, in the U.S. where it started, we've had it for 15 years now, probably. You came in and we just signed job, we asked you what you wanted. We didn't do a lot in maybe 20 or 25, at most 25 of every 100 signed up as an executive member. Today, it's in the 50s, closing in -- close to 60, and that's with just trying a little bit and showing them the value of it.  So I think we've done a better job of doing that. We do a better job when we go into a new country, we're now in I think 5 of our -- 6 of our countries, which are the largest ones. You want to have at least 15 or so locations before you're looking at it to put an executive membership on it. So we've toyed with the idea of having something even higher than the executive, but we always go back to the fact that what we have works very well. And so I don't think there's anything currently on our plate to change that.  We're always -- we've also asked the question, at some point, right now at 72% or 73% of our sales over the executive member, what happens when it gets to 85 or 90, do you eliminate the lower membership. At some point, we might, but that's, again, not in the cards at any time in the near future. We kind of like to what we're doing, it's working fine. John Heinbockel : And secondly, where are you on the personalization journey? I know you hired somebody maybe 2 years ago to kind of spearhead that. Where are we in does that pick up steam in the next year or so? Richard Galanti : I think it picks up, Stephen, in the next year or so. The first order of business, when we brought in people on that data analytics side 2 years ago, a person, he has built a great team. And we're seeing small deliverables, first and foremost, not online, but with the merchants and to a smaller extent, with some of the operators. And there's been some real deliverables that have saved our buyers' time and those are in the process of being rolled out.  On the personalization and targeting, I think we've got a little better targeting and that -- and still have a journey on the personalization, but that will be coming. But I thank you for asking it when you said a year or two. We'll take two more questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Loop Capital. Laura Champine : I'll make it quick. To follow on to the unit growth questions asked earlier, but it sounds like you're positioning the business to launch more international stores. Is it -- does it make sense for me to interpret that as unit growth may accelerate next fiscal year and beyond from this looks like it's going to be about 3.5% this year. Richard Galanti : Well, look, our goal for the last several years, there was the unique year of COVID where we went down to 13 openings because there were several that construction had stopped for several months in the middle of 2020. But the reality is, if you go back 5 or 6 years, we were opening 25-ish, some of the years 21 or 22-ish. And the view even then was to get up to closer to 30, certainly 25% to 30%. I think this year is we're finally hitting that with the expectation of 28 in my call this morning and call it, 26 to 30, whatever it comes out to be. And we would certainly be comfortable at 30.  One of the things that is unique is we try to be relatively methodical about it, particularly in new international markets. Once you open the first one, if it's successful, you're taking some people from that one, to help and succeed in opening the second one.  One of the things is it's the biggest cost factor on warehouse P&L is labor and efficiency. And when you're running a high-volume unit, it's helpful when you've got more people coming over from a nearby unit. So we are pretty methodical about growing somewhat slowly in new markets. We went from 1 to 5 20 years ago, over a 5-year period in Japan. We've sped up a little in China, thinking that we've opened 2 now in 3 years, and with another several in process and a couple more. So we've increased it a little bit. But we feel pretty good about that. So I would still say our rounded pat answer right now is 25% to 30%, and we'd like it to be more to 30 than 25 right now. But we're not necessarily looking at that percentage. As we get bigger, God willing and year 6 through 10, we're going to be talking about 30% to 35%, but we'll have to wait and see. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Peter Benedict from Baird. Peter Benedict : So my questions have been asked. But just thinking about the supply chain situation and just curious if it's caused you guys to rethink or accelerate any of your kind of sourcing initiatives. I mean, you talked about the vessels and the containers, and that clearly seems to be in reaction to what's going on. But I'm thinking more along the lines of categories, these efforts you've been underway for a long time going vertical. Are there any that maybe have jumped to the front of the line because of what you've seen over the last year? Richard Galanti : Well, I think a couple of things we've got, not in a big way, but a couple of things we've done is there's probably a little bit more diversification of suppliers, particularly on huge $300 million to $1 billion SKUs. You need a little bit more there. We've brought in certain things -- nontraditional to its season during the winter bringing in bikes because we could have access to them, and we sold them. Yes, new countries of origin. So there's a few of those things, but not in a big way. Part of our success is huge buying power per item and having less than 4,000 SKUs to do our $200 billion is quite a bit different than having even 100,000 SKUs doing $150 billion to $500 billion, depending on who the retailer is. So we've made changes, and we are more open-minded to bringing in some things. But hopefully, this thing the supply chain works out over the next couple of years in a big way, in a better way. Peter Benedict : Sure. And then just lastly, the executive membership, 43% of the members and 7% of the sales. How -- where are those numbers? And maybe your more established markets where you've had it? And maybe how underpenetrated is it in some of the newer markets? Just trying to get a sense of what the pathway might be for some of these newer markets. Richard Galanti : Yes. Well, it's like renewal rates. Renewal rates, irrespective of what it becomes 10 years hence in a location than in the market, it starts off at a lower number and builds up to the higher number. Same thing with that executive transition. We're doing better today and even in first year new markets. I think in the last couple of years, where we added executive Japan and Korea. And -- what? Yes, I mean that 42% number is hovering in the low 50s, 50 or a little higher in more mature markets. and starts off lower in other markets, but higher than it started in the previous new market a few years ago, so it grows over time. Well, thank you very much. Everyone, have a good afternoon and evening, and I appreciate you getting on the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participant\u2019s are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today. Thank you. Please go ahead. Bob Nelson : Thank you, Erica, and good afternoon to everyone. This is Bob Nelson, Senior VP of Finance and Investor Relations here at Costco. Thank you for dialing in into today's conference call to review our third quarter fiscal year 2022 operating results. Before we begin, a couple of housekeeping items to take care of. First, as you now have surmised, Richard is not with us today. He is doing great and wishes he could be on the call. He is in Italy with his family on a rescheduled vacation that was canceled early in the pandemic. He wanted me to pass along his best to everyone and in his absence I will be filling in for him today. Secondly, and before we get into the details of today's earnings results, I need to read our safe harbor disclosure. Let's begin. These discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and our performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. Okay. With that out of the way, let's get to it. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the 12 weeks ended this past May 8th. Net income for the quarter was $1.353 billion, $3.04 per diluted share. The reported $3.04 included a one-time $77 million pre-tax charge, $0.13 per diluted share for incremental benefits awarded under the new employee agreement effective this past March 14th. Last year's third quarter net income was $1.22 billion, $2.75 per diluted share, which included $57 million pre-tax or $0.09 per diluted share for costs incurred primarily from COVID-19 premium wages. In terms of this year's $77 million pre-tax charge, this was in conjunction with our new employee agreement, again, effective this past March 14th and was primarily to adjust our benefit accrual to account for one additional day of vacation, which is awarded to each employee immediately. The continuing impacts of the wage and benefit enhancements are reflected in SG&A and margin for this quarter and will be in for -- as well as for subsequent quarters. Net income for the first 36 weeks of fiscal 2022 was $3.98 billion, $8.94 per diluted share, and that compares to $3.34 billion or $7.51 per diluted share last year. Now -- let's now review the metrics of our P&L. As always, starting with sales, net sales for the third quarter increased 16.3% to $51.61 billion and that compares to $44.38 billion reported last year in Q3. In terms of comparable sales for the third quarter, for the 12 weeks on a reported basis, the US was better or up by 16.6%, Canada better by 15.2%. Other international, up 5.7% and total company, again, up 14.9%. Our e-comm business in the third quarter reported better by 7.4% versus a year ago. For the 12 weeks, excluding the benefit of gas inflation and the headwinds of FX the US came in at up 10.7%, Canada better by 12.8%, other international up $9.1 million, and on a total company basis, ex gas inflation and FX headwinds better by 10.8%, and e-commerce just below 8% at 7.9% for the quarter. In terms of Q3 comp metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.8% worldwide and up 5.6% in the US. Our average transaction was up 7.6% worldwide and up 10.4% in the US during the quarter. And foreign currencies relative to the US dollar negatively impacted sales by just a little over 1% and our gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales in the quarter, just a little bit more than 5%. The best performing categories in Q3 were candy, sundries, tires, toys, jewelry, kiosks, home furnishings, apparel, bakery and deli. Underperforming departments were liquor, office, sporting goods and hardware, all of which were quite strong a year ago. In terms of other business sales, the best performers came in from gasoline, travel, food courts and our business centers. So overall, our sales grew nicely in the quarter. And for the most part, were pretty broad-based. Moving down the income statement to membership fee income reported in Q3, $984 million or 1.91 as a percentage of sales, compared to last year's $901 million or 2.03 as a percentage of sales. That's up $83 million year-over-year or a 9.2% increase. And excluding headwinds from FX of about $10.6 million, membership was up, 10.4% in the quarter. In terms of renewal rates, we hit an all-time -- we hit all-time highs. At Q3 end, our US and Canada renewal rate was 92.3%, up 0.3% from the 12 weeks earlier at Q2 end. And the worldwide rate came in at 90% for the first time in company history, and that's up 0.4% from what we reported at Q2 end. Renewal rates continue to benefit from the increased penetration of both auto renewals and more executive members. And in addition to that, higher first year member renewal rates than what we have historically seen. In terms of member counts, number of member households and cardholders at Q3 end, we ended Q3 with 64.4 million paid households and 116.6 million cardholders, both of those up over 6%, compared to a year ago. At Q3 end, our paid executive memberships were 27.9 million, and that's an increase of just about 800,000 during the 12 weeks since Q2 end. Executive members now represent over 43% of our member base and over 71% of our worldwide sales. Now before I move on, I want to take just a minute and address the question that we've been getting a lot recently regarding the timing of the potential membership fee increase. Historically, we've raised fees every five to six years with the last three increases coming on average at about the 5.5-year time frame, and our last increase coming in June of 2017. As we approach this 5.5-year mark, there will be more discussions with Craig, Ron and the executive team. But for today, we have nothing more specific to report in terms of timing. In addition, given the current macro environment, the historically high inflation and the burden it is having on our members and all consumers in general, we think increasing our membership fee today ahead of our typical timing is not the right time. We will let you know, however, when that changes. Okay. Moving on, along the P&L, let's take a look at gross margins. Our reported gross margins in the third quarter were lower year-over-year by 99 basis points. This year coming in at 10.19% as a percentage of sales, and that compares to last year\u2019s 11.18% that we reported a year ago, so the 99 basis points down year-over-year. And excluding the negative impact of gas inflation, we would have been down 53 basis points. So if you would for me and as normal, please jot down the following for our gross margin metrics. And again, as usual, two columns, the first column being reported gross margin, the second column being gross margin and without the impact of gas inflation. There are six rows, the first row being merchandised core; second, ancillary and other business; the third row, 2% rewards; followed by LIFO; other; and then total. So in terms of our core merchandise margins on a reported basis, they were down 87 basis points versus last year, down 46 basis points ex-gas, ancillary and other plus six reported and plus 18 ex-gas, 2% rewards plus eight and plus three; LIFO, minus 25 basis points on a reported basis and minus 27% ex gas inflation; and finally, other minus one with and without gas. So again, in total, down 99 reported, down 53 excluding the impact of gas inflation. A little color, more color on gross margins, starting with core merchandise. The core merchandise contribution to gross margin was lower by 46 basis points, ex gas inflation in the quarter. Sales mix negatively impacted the core, primarily from the lower sales penetration of total core sales relative to our gasoline sales, which were very strong in the quarter. In terms of the core margins on their own sales in Q3, our core-on-core margins were lower by 39 basis points. Approximately two-thirds of this coming from fresh foods. Fresh experienced a very difficult compare versus last year when the extraordinary volumes produced lower D&D and higher labor productivity a year ago. Also contributing to the fresh decline this quarter were higher raw material costs and higher labor costs due to our new wages. Ancillary and other business gross margin, again, higher by six reported higher by 18 basis points ex gas inflation. Gas, travel and business centers were better year-over-year, offset somewhat by e-com, pharmacy and optical. Again, 2% rewards higher by eight reported higher by three ex gas. LIFO, minus 25 and minus 27 ex gas as we recorded $130 million charge in the quarter for LIFO and other was minus 1 basis point, both with and ex gas inflation. This included items from both years. Last year, we had $14 million of COVID expenses, primarily premium wages within gross margin. This year, we had a onetime charge discussed at the beginning of the call, $20 million of the $77 million, of which related to gross margin. The net result of these two items, again, minus 1 basis point. And while we continue to mitigate the impact of price increases as best as we can, we remain comfortable in our ability to pass through higher costs while providing great value to our members. Moving to SG&A. We showed good results. Our reported SG&A in the third quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 84 basis points, coming in at 8.62% and that compares to last year's reported 9.46% SG&A figure. That's, again, 84 basis points lower or better and 44 basis points, excluding the impact of gas inflation. Again, if you jot down the following for our SG&A matrix, again, two columns, the first column being reported SG&A the second column, SG&A ex the impact of gas inflation. And we have five rows, the first row operations, second row central, third row stock compensation expense, third -- or fourth through other and then total is the fifth row. In terms of our operations on a reported basis, SG&A was better by 68 basis points and ex the benefit of gas inflation better by 35. Central better by 15 reported, better by 10 ex gas. Stock compensation better by two reported, better by one ex-gas and other minus one and minus twp ex gas. Again, all totaled 84 basis points lower or better and 44 excluding the benefit of gas inflation. In Q3 year-over-year, the core operations component of SG&A was better by 68%, again, 35 ex gas. Keep in mind, this result includes the starting wage increase we instituted this past October, as well as eight weeks of the new wage and benefit increases just implemented during Q3 on October 14 of this year. Central was better by 15 and better by 10 without gas. Stock comp plus two, plus one without gas and again, other minus one basis point, minus two without gas inflation. Similar to gross margin, this included items from both years. Last year, we had $44 million of COVID expenses. And this year, we had a one-time charge again discussed at the beginning of the call, $57 million of the $77 million, which related to SG&A. The net result of these two items, again, minus one reported, minus two ex gas inflation. So all told, reported operating income in Q3 of this year increased 8%, coming in at $1.791 billion. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $35 million this year versus $40 million last year. And interest income and other for the quarter was higher by 44 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to favorable FX. Overall, pre-tax profit \u2013 pre-tax income came in for the quarter at up 11%, coming in at $1.827 billion, and that compares to $1.65 billion, which we reported a year ago. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q3 was 24.9% that compares to 25.2% in Q3 last year. Overall, for the year, our effective tax rate is currently projected to be between 26% and 27%. A few other items of note, warehouse expansion. In Q3, we opened one net new warehouse plus two relocations. Q3 year-to-date, we have opened 17 warehouses, including three relocations, for a net of 14 new warehouses so far this fiscal year. For the remainder of the fiscal year and in Q4, we expect to open an additional 10 new warehouses, which will put us at 27 for the year, including three relocations and for a net of 24 net new warehouses for all of fiscal year 2022. The 24 new warehouses by market are 14 in the US, two in Canada and one each in Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Spain, France, China and our first opening in New Zealand, which will occur in August of this year. In terms of the new openings this year, this is four fewer than what we projected in Q2. Two of the four were impacted by supply chain issues related to electrical equipment. And the other two have been delayed due to third-party site development issues. All four of these buildings are now scheduled to open by the end of calendar November this fall. Incidentally, there are three in the US and one in Australia that were delayed. The one net new opening in Q3 was a business center located in San Marcos, California. And the first of the 10 scheduled to open in Q4 opened this past week in Riverton, Utah, bringing our worldwide total to 830 Costco's as of today and around the world. Regarding CapEx, the Q3, 2022 spend was approximately $854 million. Our full year CapEx spend is estimated for the year to be just shy of about $4 billion. In terms of our e-comm business, comm sales in Q3, ex-FX increased 7.9%. This is on top of the 38% increase a year ago. Stronger departments in the quarter were special order, patio and garden, jewelry and home furnishings. Our largest e-comm merchandise department managers, which includes consumer electronics, appliances, TVs, was up a little bit better than mid-single digits on a very strong sales increase a year earlier. And Costco grocery, including our third-party delivery, two-day dry, fresh and frozen continues to grow, up low double digits in the quarter. An update on Costco Logistics. Costco Logistics continues to drive big and bulky sales for us. We averaged more than 58,000 stops a week in the third quarter. For the full year, we estimate total deliveries will be up 23% and will exceed $3 million. With Logistics, we continue to transition from vendor drop ship to direct ship from our own inventory, particularly in big and bulky items. Overall, this lowers the cost of merchandise and improved delivery times and service levels for our members. Okay. A few -- now a few comments regarding inflation. First of all, it continues. Pressures from higher commodity prices, higher wages, higher transportation costs and supply chain disruptions all still in play. For Q1, we estimate price inflation was in the 4.5% to 5% range. For Q2, we had estimated 6%-ish, if you will. And for Q3 and talking to our merchants, estimated price inflation was in the 7%-ish range. However, we did see inflation in fresh foods come in slightly lower in Q3 versus Q2 a year ago as we began cycling high meat prices. We believe our solid sales increases and relatively consistent margins show that we have continued to strike the right balance in passing on higher costs. Switching over to inventory for a minute. Our total inventory in Q3 was up 26% year-over-year versus up 19% in Q2, a couple of high-level comments regarding inventory. A material component of the increase year-over-year is inflation rather than unit growth. We continue to expand open new locations, 20 new in the last 12 months. We are lapping some low stocks in certain departments as a result of last year's high demand. And we are purposely building inventory in our e-comm business, primarily in big and bulky categories as mentioned earlier in the call. Food and sundries and fresh is in very good shape. Our weak supply is comparable year-over-year. Nonfood inventories are up in certain categories. This is in part a result of being light in certain departments last year, specifically, seasonal lawn and garden, TVs, appliances and sporting goods. Otherwise, we are a little heavy in small appliances and domestics, primarily due to late arriving merchandise this year. In addition, we have a few hundred million dollars of extra inventory in both late arriving holiday merchandise from last season, which we're storing until this fall and some buy in merchandise to ensure proper inventory levels in the face of these ongoing supply chain issues. Speaking with Craig, Ron and Claudine Adamo, our new Head of Merchandising, we feel good about our current inventory levels. The additional inventory we're carrying is in the right departments, and they feel good about our ability to move it. A quick update on China. Our first opening in China located in Minhang, Shanghai was closed for the last six weeks of the third quarter. That closure had a negative impact in the quarter of approximately $35 million in sales. As of May 18, we're happy to report that building is back open, but operating under restrictions on the number of people that can be in the building at one time, among other cleaning and operating restrictions. Our second building in Suzhou, which opened in December of this last December, was largely -- has largely avoided the lockdowns and restrictions to this point. We're currently targeting an opening date of this December for our third Shanghai building in Pudong. The timing, although will somewhat depend on the area remaining open for the next several months and not being more negatively impacted by lockdowns Four additional China buildings are currently underway and planned. It was opening dates in the next two years. These would be our first China openings outside of Shanghai. I believe we have -- of those four, one is in fiscal 2023 and three in fiscal 2024. As a reminder, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending Sunday, May 29, this next week on Thursday, June 2, after market close. This is a day later than our traditional Wednesday release due to the Memorial Day holiday. Before wrapping up, a quick shout out to the 300,000 worldwide Costco employees around the globe, and the excellent work and proactive effort they give each day to navigate during these most challenging environment. Our merchants and operators are the best in the business, and their hard work is reflected in our strong operating results. Finally, I want to address some incorrect information floating around on social media and a few other media outlets claiming that we have increased the price of our $1.50 hot dog and soda combinations sold in our food courts. Let me just say the price when we introduced the hot dog/ soda combo in the mid-80s was $1.50. The price today is $1.50, and we have no plans to increase the price at this time. With that, I will turn it back over to Erika and open it up for Q&A. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Hey, Bob. How are you doing? Bob Nelson : Good. Simeon Gutman : Who's going to whisper the answers, if you're the one doing all of the... Bob Nelson : I got help. Simeon Gutman : Okay. I hear it. Can you tell on the core on core margin ex gas, it looks like underlying run rate got a little worse, which I don't think is a big surprise given what we're hearing out there. You mentioned in the core on core, the perishable year-over-year -- but is it safe that is it transport, or is it \u2013 there's some markdowns on erratic inventory coming in? Can you talk a little bit about what's happening there? Thanks. Bob Nelson : Yes. On the fresh side, we literally had no D&D last year. And we had very high labor productivity because of the pounds that we were going \u2013 that we were processing, if you will. So I think we've kept a lot of that leverage actually. We're way above pre-pandemic levels. It's just that was extraordinary last year. So \u2013 and I think we'll keep some of that. But it's not all that. And then a little bit of it is, like I said, raw material costs this year. I mean, those eventually make their way into our \u2013 the price of our goods. But as you know, we're not the first one to go up when we have higher costs. I think just recently, it may have been after the end of the quarter, we reluctantly, but we took up the price of our muffins and our croissants, I think $1 as the price of a lot of those raw materials have continued to escalate to two and three and four times what they were last year. So that's essentially what's going on there. Simeon Gutman : Got it. Maybe my follow-up is anything happening on trip consolidation, items per trip rising? Anything that, I'm sure this is a question you're ready for. Bob Nelson : Yeah. Honestly, we're not seeing a lot of change in our throughput in the buildings. I mean, we're seeing a lot of traffic. We're not seeing a lot of \u2013 we're not seeing trade down really. We're seeing a little bit of shift in where people are spending their money. Last year, there was more stuff for the home and that \u2013 and this year, it's more sales in tickets and restaurants and travel and tires and gas and things of that nature. But we're still holding our own in areas like apparel and furniture and jewelry, TVs, appliances. All those departments are showing good decent sales growth on top of pretty good numbers a year ago. I would say overall, there might be a very small amount in terms of the number of items in the basket this year. A little less than last year because there was more trip consolidation going on a year ago, I think, during COVID. But overall, I think we feel pretty good about what we're seeing and how our members are shopping. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks Bob. Take care. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom : Okay. Thanks a lot. Good job, Bob, today. Just curious, Craig's view on balancing the desire to show value, particularly lately as the macro backdrop continues to get more uncertain, while also passing on some price increases like you articulated, inflation up anywhere between 5% to 7%. But we know, in some cases, the pressures are much higher. So, just curious where Craig is on that balance? Bob Nelson : Well, look, I think we always want to be the best value in the marketplace. And to the extent that we continue to show that, I think it's easier for us to pass on higher pricing, or higher freight costs, or raw material cost, assuming that we show that value in the marketplace. And that's what it's all about really. And I think we feel good about it. I mean, our most recent shops against who we watch most closely have not changed. And we're every bit as competitive as we've been, notwithstanding the fact we have taken some prices up in certain areas in food, in sundries and in fresh foods. Chuck Grom : Okay. Great. And then on the core on core, you talked about two-third being fresh. Just wonder if you could just give us some color on some of the discretionary categories? Bob Nelson : Well, I think the balance was slightly more in nonfoods than in foods in terms of the remaining third of the lower margins. I'm not sure I have specifics right now on certain specific categories. I mean, again, it's not really a category, we're an item business, and so it's all about certain items where we might move or not move. Chuck Grom : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot Bob. Bob Nelson : Thanks Chuck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Megan Alexander : Hi. Thanks very much. This is Megan Alexander on for Chris. Maybe a follow-up to Simeon's question. Are you seeing any pressure from rising fuel and diesel with regards to transportation in that core-on-core? And if so, it seems like they accelerated pretty quickly at the end of April. Are you holding back any of the price increases on those costs, such that it's impacting core-on-core maybe more than normal? Bob Nelson : No, I don't believe so, Megan. I mean, I think overall, there's higher transportation costs across the whole supply chain, whether it's ocean freight or trucking or the price of fuel, et cetera, et cetera. I think eventually, those costs make their way into your sale price. Again, it's not like anything else. We tend to drag a little bit compared to others, but I don't think there's a material change since the end of April in terms of how we're managing that. Megan Alexander : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on LIFO. Since price increases have continued, it seems. Does that pressure continue to accelerate going forward? And then do we ever get that back as we lap, or does it depend on what the cost environment looks like? Bob Nelson : Yeah. We I certainly can't be predictive and tell you exactly where it's going. We've, obviously, seen more inflation as years progressed. If we stay at this level, there will continue to be some impacts to our P&L. If we start to see deflation, if we were in an inflationary environment next year, yeah, we would get some of that back. But we've got a ways to go. I think everybody thinks we're still in a cycle of more inflation versus it stopping. Now to be fair, this is the first time when we get into Q4 that we'll actually start cycling some at the beginning of this last year. And I think we had a small LIFO charge in Q4 a year ago. So I'm not predicting, but we saw a little bit of decline in our fresh food inflation in this past quarter. Will we see some in other areas as we enter Q4? Maybe, but that could be offset by higher costs in other areas in the supply chain. So -- and then, of course, that higher level of inflation started hitting us in Q1 and Q2 of the beginning of this year. So I really can't predict where it's going to go. But assuming we get more inflation, we'll have more LIFO charges. To the extent that reverses at some point, we'll get some credits. Megan Alexander : Got it. Thank you very much. Bob Nelson : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Scot Ciccarelli : Hey, Bob, how are you? Bob Nelson : Hi. Good. Scot Ciccarelli : Good. I guess, more of a business strategy question, if you will. You guys had some pretty good SG&A leverage, which helped offset the merch margin compression that you saw, I guess the question is, would you tried to pass on more price increases to protect your gross margin if you didn't think you'd have as much SG&A leverage as you were able to generate? Bob Nelson : That's a hard one to answer. Look, it's all -- look, we would never raise prices if we could get SG&A leverage in every single quarter from now until eternity. I mean, our goal would be to lower prices indefinitely and lower SG&A. It's all a balancing act. Sure. The same can be said on gross margins. I mean, everybody's read what's going on out there in the industry. Our sales in gas were very strong. Our gross margins were strong. And to the extent we're able to lever that into other areas of the business by holding prices? That's what we do. That's retail. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. John Heinbockel : Hey, Bob, I want to start with -- because we're uncharted territory here with inflation in recent times. To what degree do you guys -- and I don't think you do much of this, but test we're going to take pricing up in certain places, see what the consumer reaction is and then go more broadly. And have you seen any item by item, any elasticity, where you'd say, okay, we're not going to roll it out or not roll out the price increase or roll it back? Bob Nelson : Yes. John, honestly, we don't really test markets or we won't take a market like Seattle and test taking a price up beyond our comfort level. It all comes down to value proposition and if we feel like we can take a price up and pass on some of the costs that we're incurring in our goods and the value proposition is still there, we'll go there. We're not testing all these items across the space. John Heinbockel : Okay. Bob Nelson : I mean it is unprecedented times. I will tell you that because of our limited SKU counts and the small number of SKUs that each buyer actually manages, they have a pretty good understanding of where their competitive situation is in the marketplace, and they have a pretty good feel about what kind of business they can do at what price. And I think that helps us in terms of managing that. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then maybe secondly, gas gallons, right? So what has that been up? And I guess, historically, right, higher gas prices have translated into share gains for you. Are you starting to see that accelerate and drive some incremental traffic to clubs? Bob Nelson : Well, that's a good question. Obviously, our value proposition in the marketplace is best-in-class, and it's actually accelerated versus where it was a year ago. I think the industry demand in gallons for gas is in the 1% to 2% range. And what I can tell you is we are much better than that in the high teens, the low 20s in terms of where we've been trending. I will say, we're certainly getting a lot of shops in the building when people buy gas. But given the extraordinarily high level, we're also getting a lot more members come by and top off their tank just because the value proposition in some cases is over $1 a gallon. And those members will come by and buy five or six gallons and then be on their way. So it's difficult to measure because of the -- just a huge amount of volume we're getting through our stations right now. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : Hi. Thanks very much. So two questions. Bob, obviously, you addressed the membership component that everyone has on their mind. But I guess what I'm curious to hear from you is I think you've wavered in one another direction like based on the last four months. And so I'm curious to hear why you are kind of steadfast now that you would not raise membership fee, not that I necessarily think you should, but obviously, you've taken the stance. So that's my first question. Bob Nelson : Well, I don't think we've really wavered. I think once we get a year out or year and a half out from that five and a half year cycle, we, frankly, just start to get a lot of questions about it. And the commentary in the prepared remarks is really more about just saying at this time, we don't think it's right for us. We're not saying that, we're not going to do it. We're just saying it's not right for us right now. And I think that's the same answer we had three months ago when we talked about it on the second quarter call. So I don't think anything's really changed other than we're just not at the five and a half year cycle yet. Does that make sense? Karen Short : Yeah, that makes sense. And then you made two comments just in terms of \u2013 I think you said that you were a little heavy in small clients holiday inventory, but you feel good about your ability to clear the inventory. So I just wanted to clarify what exactly you mean on that in terms of preparing potentially for a slowdown with the consumer and/or if you're thinking or maybe if you're not thinking there is? And where are you at on that broadly? Bob Nelson : Well, I can't tell you whether I think there's going to be more pull back in a month or two months or three months. I mean, again, we feel really good about our ability to drive traffic and drive our members in and frankly, the ability to drive the top line. What I spoke to Ron yesterday about this, look, he thinks that we got a couple of extra weeks of supply in a couple of areas, and he thinks we can move through the inventory without really a lot of harbor or problem. On the seasonal stuff, a lot of that is just Christmas stuff that came in late \u2013 we've got it in deep freeze, and we're going to put it out this fall. And we're probably going to put it out at pretty good values because the price of all that stuff is going up. So we feel pretty good about being able to move that. And then the other comment I made is just more inventory that we think makes sense to have like masks and things like that, but where if there's some kind of hiccup in \u2013 in COD, we\u2019re well prepared. So I don\u2019t want to say strategic, but its \u2013 its a little bit more inventory than we might typically carry in a kind of non-environment like we're in now. Karen Short : Okay. Sorry to sneak one last one in. In terms of the fuel, obviously, that's a huge draw for you to your stores. Is there any update on the conversion into the store during your open hours in terms of people filling up the tanks and then actually going into the store conversion because I think that's historically been 70-ish percent during open hours? Bob Nelson : No, no, no. That number has been like 50%. I'm not sure where 70% came from. That number has come down slightly. And again, because of what I mentioned earlier, we have a lot more members coming by and topping off their tank. But the overall number of shops from people buying gas is probably up. It's just the percentage is down because we have way more people going through the stations. So the penetration is down a little bit, but the number of relative shops is up probably. Karen Short : Okay. I thought it was 70% during open hours and 50 overall, but maybe I was wrong. So, thank you. Bob Nelson : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : Hi guys, good afternoon. I was hoping that maybe you could share some thoughts on the outlook for the gross margin in fiscal Q4. As we think about some of the pieces, year-over-year, the core compare kind of is easier, but it's not really on a two-year basis. It seems like you're probably still going to have LIFO. I don't think fuel margins are off to a very good start at all, but I -- maybe that's just because gas prices are rising and obviously, it's a long quarter. I'm just curious as to like the expectation that we should have around the current quarter? Bob Nelson : Yeah, Ed, I wish I could be more transparent about -- we don't know what our budgets are on everything, but we really don't guide in terms of where gross margins are going to be. I think it continues to be a challenging environment. I think we feel good about our ability to pass through certain costs. In other areas, we don't feel as good about it, and we want to hold prices. So I think it's -- I can't tell you where exactly it's going to be. I think it's -- if I had to kind of -- it will be -- it looked much like what you're looking at this quarter. Maybe a little less, maybe a little more. But other than that, we really just don't -- we don't guide. Edward Kelly : Yeah. Okay. That's helpful. All right. Well, the other thing that I wanted to ask about, and you touched on it is just how you're navigating product cost inflation and pass through the customers? And I know historically, you would lag competition. I think maybe those like that -- the length of that lag has maybe been reduced to some extent. I don't know if that's true, just color there. And then what have you been able to do from a vendor standpoint because you don't sell a lot of SKUs, right? So you do have some real scale advantage within those products. So I'm just curious as to how those negotiations are going as well? Bob Nelson : Well, look, like we've always said, our first goal is to mitigate any price increase. And our first goal is to partner with our vendor and figure out if there's a way to mitigate it for both of us. And that's the strategy. It's certainly more difficult times because there's more pressures coming from different areas. It's not just raw material cost, it's labor. It's -- there's more factors involved in it. But look, as you alluded to, we have -- we do a lot of volume in a relatively small number of the SKUs were very important to our suppliers in terms of the volume we do in some of these. And so they work with us. And I think at the end of the day, again, it's about showing the best value proposition in every item that we have on the shelf. And to the extent we're able to pass on some of those costs, and we still show a great value in that item, and that's great. In some instances, maybe we're not able to do that as effectively. But overall, I feel pretty good about our merchants being able to navigate through this. It's -- we've had a lot to navigate through the last couple of quarters. And I think I feel good about our ability to continue to do it as we look out into Q4 and then into the next fiscal year. Edward Kelly : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Peter Benedict : Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Bob, nice job. A question on private label. Kirkland penetration, just maybe where that sits relative to maybe a year ago? And are you seeing any particular areas where you're getting stronger traction or growth rates are picking up there? Just curious how the consumer is behaving around private label. Bob Nelson : Yes. I -- we actually took a look at that, and we were up a little bit in terms of penetration, probably 30 or 40 basis points. So we're still doing a lot of business there. But again, we're not -- as I mentioned earlier, when I was talking about the consumer, we're not seeing, I don't think a lot of trade down or trade out into -- from branded into our private label. So we continue to grow it, but I think in a way that makes sense for our business. And it's -- our consumers really aren't changing how they are shopping with us. I think we're up 0.4, I think, somewhere around 26 and change number in terms of penetration on a global basis? Peter Benedict : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then -- just -- I think you mentioned the higher year one renewal rate. I'm just curious maybe how long you've been seeing that? Is that a US dynamic? Is it an international dynamic? Is it happening everywhere, or maybe frame the numbers a little bit just to how much better it's been. Bob Nelson : Yes, sure. We have historically been, depending on the country in the area, somewhere in the kind of low 50s to low -- sorry, high 50s to maybe 60, low 60s. And those numbers now are depending on the country in the high 60s to low 70s. So we've gradually seen over the last two years since the pandemic started about a 10% bump in our first year renewal -- our first year members, if you will, which we view as very favorable because we obviously signed up a lot of new members that hadn't tried us. Before the pandemic, they tried us, had a good experience, and we're seeing better retention rates out of those members. Peter Benedict : Yes. Well, certainly better than it going to the opposite direction. So good job. Thanks very much. Bob Nelson : Thanks. Thanks, Peter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Brandon Cheatham : Hey. This is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. I just wanted to ask about supply chain bottlenecks. Any particular categories that have improved any that have gotten worse. I think some of your competitors have mentioned general merge and furniture as some categories that have been challenging. Just wondering, if you all are seeing that as well. Bob Nelson : Yes. I'm just -- I'm sitting here with Ron and he's indicating to me that we're pretty much across the board, improving everywhere slightly from where we were. It's not really in any one particular category. It's -- I think part of that is there's 40 or 50 ships in LA now instead of 100 or 120, and the fact that we've been able to utilize our own ships to kind of help get product over here. I think it's just improved a little bit across the board in all -- in everything that we're purchasing. Brandon Cheatham : Thanks. And I think in the past, you've mentioned that if you did have shortages, you would be able to kind of switch out a vendor or utilize an existing member -- vendor for new product. Has that kind of slowed because the supply chain has improved? Bob Nelson : Well, look, we certainly are able to pivot more easily because we have less category business and more item business. So to the extent we're having difficulty in a particular item or have a hard time showing value in a particular item. We are able to pivot over into something else and put it in the warehouse. I don't -- I think that's just part of our DNA. What we do here every day, whether it's in the environment where we're operating in now or in a normal environment. So I think it's just a competitive advantage based on our \u2013 the structure of our business. Brandon Cheatham : Yeah. Appreciate it. Thanks. And good luck. Bob Nelson : Yeah. Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Erica Eiler : Good afternoon. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our question. So I guess, first, you touched on gas prices and driving traffic to clubs, I was just curious, given the gas price dynamic out there right now, do you think that's driving more memberships at all to clubs as perhaps consumers seek out more value in this environment? Bob Nelson : Sure. Sure, yeah. Sure. I think every member that signs up has a different reason, but sure, absolutely, particularly given the extreme value proposition in that \u2013 in gas right now. Erica Eiler : Okay. And then just shifting gears kind of back to discretionary. You touched on seeing consumers spend in other categories, which is what we're hearing from everyone out there right now. I'm just curious, based on what you're seeing to date, has anything surprised you in terms of the shift by category that you're seeing right now that perhaps you hadn't planned for? Bob Nelson : Not really. I mean, some of the areas I mentioned like sporting goods, well, all the gyms are opening up again and a lot of \u2013 within sporting goods, it's really exercise equipment that \u2013 we sold a lot a year ago. And this year, people are back at the gyms. Office is down a little bit. And again, people were setting up working from home a year ago. So it's no surprise to us that, that department is a little bit softer than a year ago. So not really, I think the categories that we're seeing be a little bit softer than we expect or categories that we expected to be soft. It's not a big surprise. Erica Eiler : Okay. Great. Thank you. Bob Nelson : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Kelly Bania : Well, thanks and well done, Bob. Just another question, as you think about that 7% inflation that you mentioned, can you maybe give us a little color on how that looks on the food and consumables side versus the discretionary side of the business. And as well, is there any difference in your ability or willingness to pass on some of the inflation on either side of the aisle there? Bob Nelson : I would say in terms of our \u2013 we're certainly seeing higher inflation in certain non-food areas, although mix is bringing that down. You're going to sell fewer say, I'm making this up, but patio sets that are up, say, 10%, then you are, say, a piece of apparel that might be up less so. It's going to be less of an impact on a smaller priced item. I think overall, the inflation that we're seeing is relatively the same. Again, we're an item business. So we're certainly seeing it higher than that in some items and lower than that in other areas of the business. And I think, again, I need to keep using this term, but it's all about the value proposition. And our willingness to take pricing along or take pricing up depends on what our position is in the marketplace. And to the extent, we continue to show great value, it's a little easier to do that. Kelly Bania : Okay. And maybe just to follow-up in terms of just big ticket in general. Can you just maybe talk about how that's trending? And do you think about maybe planning big ticket just a little bit more conservatively, or just help us understand the internal thought process about just big ticket in the current environment? Bob Nelson : Yeah. Well, again, not to keep using this term, but we're an item business, and I think we're seeing great strength in furniture right now. We're seeing great strength in patio. We didn't have a good inventory supplies a year ago. We have more inventory now, and so we're able to move that product. Things like exercise equipment isn't as selling as much because -- or barbecues, for example. Everybody bought a barbecue last year, because everybody was home and cooking from home. Those certain items like that are not selling as well this year. I think the good thing for us is we're so broad-based in terms of the merchandise that we sell that we don't really -- I guess, we don't really look at it as big ticket. Appliances is another example. Appliances are very strong this year. Now again, we had a little bit of a supply constraint last year, more issues with chips that's getting better. It's not solved. But we're in better stock this year, and we're certainly selling more appliances than we did a year ago. And those are the biggest of ticket item. So what? What about it? Oh, my guys are saying travel. Not really a big ticket, but an experience. And with everybody pent up for two years and not traveling, yeah, that business has taken off like mad. So there's a lot of discussion and talk about a recession coming, but if you look in our buildings and you look at -- if you've been on an airplane lately, you'd never notice it. Kelly Bania : Perfect. Thank you. Bob Nelson : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital. Laura Champine : Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk specifically about what you're seeing in renewal rates in China? I know that at first, you had such great member growth there. But I'm interested in how well you've retained those customers, just given what they've been through over the past few years? Bob Nelson : Yeah. Laura, I don't have those in front of me, actually. If you want to ping me offline, we can maybe give you a little bit more color. I do know that they're slightly lower than we've seen in some markets because we signed up so many members in those first two warehouses. And so I know the retention rates are a little bit lower as a percentage, but part of that is when we opened our first building there, it was the only building, and now that we have two buildings with a third coming on the Shanghai market. It's going to change the dynamics a little bit. Laura Champine : Got it. And then just a detail on that one-time charge. Did you add a vacation day just basically because June 18th [ph] was made a holiday, or is there something else going on there? Bob Nelson : No, it was just for each and every employee to use as they fit. It's essentially an additional floating holiday that each employee can use for a specific date that's important to them. Laura Champine : Got it. Thanks. Bob Nelson : Why don't we take one or two more and then David, Josh and myself will be available for some off-line questions. Operator : Okay. And your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. Bob, can you give us a little more insight into the ancillary business margin going up? Is that travel coming back? What's clearly driving that? Bob Nelson : Well, certainly, gas was the biggest driver in there. And I think we mentioned that travel was also one of the beneficiaries. Greg Melich : And was -- and so penny profit and gas, we should accept that, that was actually up year-over-year. Bob Nelson : Yes. It was up year-over-year. But keep in mind, the price of gas was up 40% year-over-year so. Greg Melich : The margin, yes. Bob Nelson : Yes, yes. Greg Melich : Got it. And then a housekeeping on the day vacation, the charge, the $77 million -- is that an accrual for the year, or is that now in the base and we should see that each of the next four quarters? Bob Nelson : It's both. It's the $77 million was essentially to get on the book, the cost of that vacation for each employee at that time on March 14, if you will. And then the ongoing cost of that is in our regular SG&A and benefit cost each quarter, correct. Greg Melich : Got it. So that\u2026 Bob Nelson : Those costs for Q3 -- or I should say, the eight weeks in Q3, we're just in the regular SG&A numbers. Greg Melich : Got it. So now -- so presumably that was eight weeks of Q3, and we can just look at the weekly and sort of use that running forward? Bob Nelson : Well, we didn't give you what it was by week. That's what it was for the year. Greg Melich : Oh, that's what it was for the -- so the $77 million was for the year? Bob Nelson : Correct. There were additional cost quarter relating to the eight weeks for that benefit\u2026 Greg Melich : Got it. Okay. Bob Nelson : I mean, I guess... Greg Melich : All right. That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot. Bob Nelson : Yes, thanks, Greg. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Wissink with Jefferies. Blake Anderson : It's Blake on for Steph. Thanks for squeezing us in. I wanted to see if you could give any color on new member growth. I know you talked about gas was a benefit to attracting members and you didn't see a lot of trade down for existing members, but I didn't know if you could talk about maybe any new members joining the club for savings on food or non-food specifically. Bob Nelson : Well, we don't really ask each member when they sign up, why they're signing up. I'm hoping that there's a different value proposition for each and every member that entices them to be a member and sign up. The one thing I can add on to that is we are getting more strength in terms of the number of members that sign up digitally and that's really grown throughout the pandemic and become a bigger percentage of our growth as well. And I think some of that has to do with some of our online offerings that hit -- particularly in say, grocery. If you don't live within 10 or 15 miles of a club. But in the pandemic, you tried this, you moved a little bit further away, you had a good experience. You signed up digitally and you stay digitally and you might use this half digitally and half in the warehouse. So I think it's a different reason for everybody, really. It just depends on your preferences. Blake Anderson : Okay. And then lastly, on renewal rate, that was strong in the quarter. Just wondering how that was versus your expectations and also the MFI growth versus your expectations as well? Thank you. Bob Nelson : Okay. My guys are telling me -- I didn't know, but I think it was pretty much in line with what our expectations were. I mean we continue -- when you kind of take a look at what's driving that, we continue to convert more base members to the executive member program who tend to renew at a higher rate and have more loyalty with us. That's contributing to that. We see that every week. So we know that's going to help the renewal rates. And so I think based on \u2013 and of course, the first year renewal rates that are improving, we know that's going to help the number as well and signing up more members. So all that, I think, is contributing to those improved metrics, if you will. Blake Anderson : Thanks, Bob. That's helpful. Bob Nelson : In auto bill, yeah. Bob Nelson : Okay. If there's no more questions, we'll call it a wrap. I appreciate everybody dialing in today. And again, David and Josh and myself are available, if you guys have any follow-ups. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to CFO, Richard Galanti. Please go ahead. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Lateef, and good afternoon to everyone. I\u2019ll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today\u2019s press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the 16 weeks ended this past August 28th. Net income for the quarter was $1.868 billion or $4.20 per diluted share compared to $1.67 billion or $3.76 per diluted share a year ago. Last year\u2019s fourth quarter was negatively impacted by an asset write-off of $84 million pretax or $0.14 per diluted share. Net income for the fiscal year totaled $5.84 billion or $13.14 a share compared to $5.01 billion or $11.27 per diluted share the prior fiscal year. Net sales for the fourth quarter increased 15.2% to $70.76 billion as compared to $61.44 billion reported last year in the fourth quarter. On a comparable sales basis from the fourth quarter, U.S. for the 16-week period on a reported basis had comp sales of 15.8%. When you exclude gas inflation and FX -- gas inflation, it\u2019d be 9.6%; Canada, 13.4% reported; 13.7% ex gas and FX; Other International, 2.9% reported and 11.3% ex gas and FX. So all told, total company was reported as 13.7%, and excluding gas and FX, plus 10.4%. Separately, e-commerce, 7.1% reported and again, excluding FX, 8.4%. In terms of the Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 7.2% worldwide and up 5.2% in the U.S. Our average transaction or ticket was up 6.0% worldwide and up 10.0% in the U. S. during the fourth quarter. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by a little over 2%, and gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 5.5%. The best-performing core categories in the quarter were candy, frozen, kiosks, tire, lawn and garden, jewelry, toys, bakery and deli. In terms of ancillary businesses, the best performers were gas and food courts. And in other businesses, travel and business centers performed best relative to the prior fiscal fourth quarter results. Going down the income statement to membership fee income on a reported basis. Membership fee income came in at $1.327 billion or 1.88%. That was up $93 million or 7.5% on a reported basis, again, with weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. That number, excluding the impact of FX, would have been $29.8 million higher, and the 7.5% reported increase would have been a 10% increase. In terms of renewal rates, we again hit all-time highs. At Q4 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate came in at 92.6%, which is three-tenths of a percentage point higher from 16 weeks earlier at Q3 end when we were at 92.3%. And our worldwide renewal rate came in at the end of the fiscal year at 90.4%, up four-tenths of a percentage point from Q3 end when it was 90.0%. In terms of the number of member households and cardholders, at Q4 end, we ended the fourth quarter with 65.8 million paid household members and 118.9 million cardholders, both up 6.5% from a year earlier. And that 6.5% increase in number of members and cardholders is on about -- just under a 3% increase in the number of locations. During the year, we opened 23 locations on a base that began the year with 815 warehouses. At Q4 end, our paid executive memberships totaled 29.1 million, an increase of 1.2 million or 74, 000 per week during the 16 weeks since third quarter end. Executive members now represent over 44% of our members and just under 72% of our worldwide sales. In terms of membership fees and a possible increase, there are no specific plans regarding a fee increase at this time. We\u2019re pleased with our growth in both, top line sales and membership households over the last several quarters, and member loyalty is reflected in increasing member renewal rates. We\u2019ll let you know when something is about to happen. Moving on to fourth quarter gross margins. For the quarter, gross margin on a reported basis came in at 10.18% compared -- down 74 basis points from last year\u2019s reported gross margin of 10.92%. Now the 74% -- the 74 basis-point year-over-year reduction is on a reported basis. Excluding gas inflation, it was minus 22 basis points. And as we normally do, we actually jot down a few numbers, and then we\u2019ll elaborate a little bit more on margin. So, the two columns would be reported year-over-year change and the second one would be ex gas inflation, net year-over-year change. So, the core merchandise margin on a reported basis, minus 67 basis points year-over-year; ex gas inflation, minus 23 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, the second line item, plus 20 and plus 34; our 2% reward, 0 and minus 5; LIFO, minus 27 and minus 28; and all told, total minus 74 reported, as I mentioned, and minus 22 on -- excluding gas inflation basis. Starting with the core. Core merchandise\u2019s contribution to gross margin was lower by 67 basis points year-over-year and by 23 ex gas inflation. The sales mix negatively impacted the core, primarily from the lower sales penetration of total core sales relative to our increasing and outsized gasoline sales. In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in Q4, our core and core margins were lower by 26 basis points. That\u2019s pretty much in line with each of the last three quarters when it ranged from minus 39 basis points year-over-year in Q3, minus 28 in Q2 and minus 18 in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. So again, for the quarter, it was minus 26 core-on-core. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin was higher by 20 basis points and higher by 34 basis points ex gas inflation in the quarter. Gas, of course, as well as business centers and travel were better year-over-year, offset somewhat by e-com, pharmacy, food court and optical, but overall, a positive year-over-year change. Our 2% reward, as I mentioned, on an ex gas inflation basis was higher or down 5 -- lower or down 5 basis points, implying higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. In terms of LIFO -- LIFO, as you know, with inflation has been increasing. It was 27 basis points, down year-over-year -- or higher year-over-year. LIFO charge this year on an ex gas inflation basis, 28 basis points higher, and that represented a $223 million charge in the quarter. Recall that our LIFO charges were relatively small in the first part of the year at $14 million; last quarter, in the third quarter, $130 million; and then as I mentioned here, $223 million for the quarter. Moving to SG&A. We showed good results. Reported SG&A came in at 8.53% compared to last year\u2019s 9.22% or an improvement of 69 basis points. But again, ex gas inflation, the improvement was still good at 26 basis points lower year-over-year. Again, jotting down a few numbers here, jotting down the numbers on a core operations basis, on a reported basis, that was plus 50 basis points or positive reduction of 50 improvement; ex gas inflation, plus 12 basis points; central, plus 2 and minus 3; stock compensation, plus 2 and plus 1; preopening expense, plus 1 and plus 2; other, plus 14 and plus 14. That gets you down to again on a reported basis, year-over-year SG&A was improved by [69] (ph) basis points; and ex gas inflation by 26 basis points. In terms of the quarter year-over-year, the core operations was, again, better by 12, excluding the impact of gas inflation. Keep in mind, these results include the starting wage increases we instituted in October of 2021, so in the first quarter of this fiscal year -- this past fiscal year, as well as new wage and benefits increases implemented during the third quarter in March of this year as well as the impact of 8 weeks in this quarter as we increase the top-of-scale increase that went into effect July 4th. So, a few increases that we\u2019ve done this year. And still, we feel pretty good SG&A improvement given our sales strength. Central was lower by 2 basis points and higher by 3 ex gas inflation. Nothing big to talk about there. Again, stock compensation I mentioned. Preopening, I\u2019ve just -- we\u2019ve noted that since we now include preopening on the income statement as part of SG&A instead of a separate line item. And other, again, the 14 basis points, recall that that included that last year\u2019s write-off in the quarter, totaling $84 million. All told, reported operating income in the fourth quarter increased 10%, coming in at $2.497 billion. A little of that benefit was that asset write-off last year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $48 million this year versus $52 million last year, relatively similar. Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $1 million year-over-year, coming in at $67 million this year versus $68 million last year. Interest income was actually higher, but that was offset by unfavorable FX impact, which pretty much offset each other to be roughly flat year-over-year. Overall, reported pretax income was up 10%, coming in at $2.516 billion this year, up from $2.291 billion a year earlier. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.4% compared to 26.1% in Q4 last year. The fiscal \u201823 effective tax rate, we estimate, is currently projected to be approximately 26%. Net -- one thing I\u2019ll mention, we haven\u2019t mentioned in the past. Net income attributable to Costco, that line item was up 12%. Recall that on June 30th this past year, we acquired the 45% minority interest from our JV partner in Taiwan. So, we now own all of Costco Taiwan. As a result, net income attributable to non-controlling interest was better by $14 million in the quarter. The non-controlling interest line will become zero going forward, essentially, a small amount, but pretty much zero. A few other items of note in terms of warehouse expansion. In the fourth quarter, we opened 9 net new warehouses. So for the full year, we opened 26 warehouses, but that included 3 relocations, so a net increase during the year of 23 locations. In the fourth quarter of the 9 we opened, 5 were in the U.S., 2 were in Canada and 1 each in Korea and Japan. In fiscal \u201823, we expect to open 29 new warehouses, including 4 relos, so for a net of 25 new warehouses. These 25 planned net new openings are made up of 15 in the U.S. and 10 in Other International, including our first locations in each of New Zealand and Sweden, and our third and fourth locations in China. Regarding capital expenditures, our fourth quarter Q4 spending CapEx was approximately $1.26 billion. And for the full year, CapEx expenditures was $3.9 billion. Our estimate for the upcoming year fiscal \u201823 CapEx to be approximately the same in the $3.8 billion to $4 billion range. In terms of e-commerce business, e-com sales in the fourth quarter ex FX increased 8.4%. Stronger departments in terms of year-over-year percentage increases were tires, lawn, patio and garden, prescription pharmacy and health and beauty aids. The largest e-com merchandise department in dollars, what we call majors, which includes everything from computers to appliances to TVs to audio, et cetera, was up in the high single digits. And Costco Grocery, including our third-party delivery, two-day dry, fresh and frozen, continue to grow. They were up 20% in the quarter. An update on Costco Logistics. With Costco Logistics, we continue to transition from vendor drop ship to direct ship from our own inventory, particularly in big and bulky items. Overall, this lowers the cost of the merchandise and improves delivery times on service levels to our members, and I\u2019ll share with you some statistics to that in a minute. Prior to this acquisition in the U.S., we were completing a few years ago about 2 million big and bulky deliveries and installations per year. In fiscal \u201822, we completed 4.3 million big and bulky deliveries and installation. Previously, all of those 2 million deliveries and installations were made by third parties. In fiscal \u201822, about 70% or a little over 3 million of the 4.3 million were done by us. In the fourth quarter, in fact, that percentage of deliveries and installations done by -- performed by us was 81%. Pre-acquisition, the estimated average days to deliver was above 15 days, and we were working with over 100 delivery partners. Today, our average delivery time for big and bulky is just under 5 days, and we\u2019re continuing to work to improve that. And we were down to 8 delivery -- primary delivery partners. A few comments regarding inflation. We\u2019ve seen minor improvement in a few areas. But all in, pressures from higher commodity prices, higher wages and higher transportation costs and supply chain disruptions. They\u2019re still present, but we are seeing just a little light at the end of the tunnel. And if you recall in the third quarter, we indicated that price inflation overall was about 7% plus for us. For the fourth quarter and talking with our merchants, the estimated price inflation overall was about 8%, a little higher on the food and sundries side, a little lower on fresh foods, and both higher and lower on the nonfood side. We\u2019re seeing commodities -- some commodities prices coming down, such as gas, steel, beef, relative to a year ago, even some small cost changes in plastics. We\u2019re seeing some relief on container pricing. Wages are still the higher thing when we talk to our suppliers. And as we all know, wages still seem to be the one thing that\u2019s still relatively higher. But overall, some beginnings of some light at the end of that tunnel. And of course, that could change each week. In all, despite current inflation levels, we believe we continue to remain competitive versus our others and able to raise prices as cost increases, hopefully, of course, a little less than others with whom we compete. Many of you have asked about private label with the recent inflationary environment and what\u2019s happening, are people trading down? And of course, our first response, of course, is they\u2019re not trading down. They\u2019re trading up or certainly trading the same. In terms of Kirkland Signature merchandise penetration, and excluding gas and other businesses that carry the Kirkland name. Kirkland Signature merchandise is up just under 1% in terms of penetration compared to a year ago. Our KS merchandise penetration is about 28% for the year. This is similar to historical trends where it\u2019s increasing slowly and steadily over time. So no big dramatic change from the past there. In terms of supply chain. Generally, supply chain has improved a little, including on-time deliveries. We started seeing container prices coming down. First place you see it, of course, is in the spot market and then you\u2019ll start to see it hopefully in some other contracts as they continue. No longer any big capacity issues or container shortages. Domestically, port delays have improved. And while the rail strike that was in the news a few weeks ago was thankfully averted. In anticipation of strike, there were some rail ramp closures and delays in restarting that. But the view from our buyers is that this should be eliminated for the most part towards the end of this week. Switching over to inventory levels. Our total inventory at Q4 end was up year-over-year, just -- was up just under 26% year-over-year. At the end of the third quarter, it was up just over 26%. Of the 26% increase, an estimated 10 to 11 percentage points of it is inflation. That\u2019s that 8% number. And new warehouse growth, that\u2019s that 3% number in terms of unit growth over the last year, but still up year-over-year. Additionally, we\u2019re lapping some low stocks in certain departments as a result of last year\u2019s high demand, specifically in nonfood areas where last year, we were about 90% of our targeted inventory levels. Food and sundries and fresh are in good shape, we feel. Our weak supply is comparable year-over-year. In terms of nonfood inventories, it\u2019s up in certain categories. Again, this is in part a result of being light in certain departments last year, as mentioned earlier. The good news so far, initial seasonal sales seem to be going well, as evidenced in our monthly sales reports. And all told, we would expect the 26% year-over-year increase to start to head down as it has in just the past few weeks a little bit. Lastly, as a reminder, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, October 2nd, this next week on Wednesday -- in two weeks, on Wednesday, October 5th, after the market closes. With that, I will open it up to questions and answers with Lateef. Thanks. Simeon Gutman : Good afternoon, everyone. Richard, I want to ask a couple of questions about membership fees. So first of all, if -- you said you were comfortable with sales. So, I\u2019m questioning if your tentative -- you\u2019re worried about the sales rate if you raise it. And then, is it fair if you don\u2019t raise it? It means you\u2019re also comfortable with the rate of EBIT growth in the business because that\u2019s been a tool for the business over time? And I know you don\u2019t guide, but I\u2019m obviously trying to get you to answer that. Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, nice try. No, look, at the end of the day, we\u2019ve always been told and we\u2019ve told you guys that we\u2019re a top line company. We\u2019re looking to always drive sales. Certainly, as we\u2019ve increased member fees historically about every 5, 5.5 years, we\u2019ve turned around and used it to drive more value. And whenever we do it, we\u2019ll do that. I think at the end of the day, it\u2019s -- and I also want to point out, of course, if you look at the last 3 increases, on average, they were 5 years and 7 months apart. If you look at June of \u201817, plus 5 years and 7 months, you\u2019re talking roughly January \u201823. Now, I\u2019m not suggesting it\u2019s January \u201823. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not there yet anyway. And our view is, is we are confident in our ability to do so and at some point, we will. But it\u2019s a question of when, not if. And given the headline of inflation and concerns about recession, we feel quite comfortable driving sales and earnings the way we are right now. And we still have that arrow in our quiver as we go forward. Simeon Gutman : And then, maybe the follow-up, same topic, still. The way -- your new fiscal year, you\u2019ve obviously planned a year. Do you cut back or you curtail spending or investments in any way that runs through the P&L if you\u2019re not planning to do it or if you are planning to do it? Richard Galanti : Not at all. I mean, it\u2019s steady as she goes in terms of CapEx and what we want to do, and what we want to do with pricing and competitive pricing. And we\u2019re not the only company out there, but as we\u2019ve seen some slight declines in reported gross margin not only this quarter, but in the last several quarters, part of that was just the upsized improvement in margin during the first year of COVID. But we are not -- as you know, we\u2019re not shy about doing what we have to do to drive the top line, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So, Richard, I guess just going back to your expense commentary. There was a sequential pickup in your expense growth versus Q3. Besides the wage increases, was there anything else that was unique to the quarter that you\u2019d call out? Richard Galanti : Well, other than it was -- it was 16 weeks versus 12 weeks, but are you talking about on a year-over-year basis? Rupesh Parikh : Yes. Year-over-year. Yes. I think it\u2019s\u2026 Richard Galanti : I think the outsized thing is just that. I mean, are utilities costs up? Sure. But the outsized thing would be the wage increases. But I\u2019m sure IT is up -- IT is always up a little more as everybody is doing more technology-wise. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Great. And then just on the health of the consumer, just given many concerns out there, anything to know, like any change in consumer behavior or even in your majors category, are you guys seeing any changes versus maybe your expectations there? Richard Galanti : Well, I think I mentioned -- or we\u2019ve mentioned when we talked to some of you over the various months was there -- when beef prices skyrocketed, now they\u2019re coming down versus a year ago, but when they skyrocket, you see a change. Irrespective of the state of the economy, you see some changes from beef to poultry and those examples. Somebody made -- one of the buyers had made a comment a few months ago that they saw some increased penetration of canned chicken and tuna for that reason. But at the end of the day, we haven\u2019t seen any big changes in that. Part of it is hard to see because we -- during these two years of COVID, we enjoyed such strength in big-ticket items. And if -- like consumer electronics, if it\u2019s up a little versus up a lot the last two years, incrementally, we know in each of those cases, our numbers relative to industries comparisons are still -- we\u2019re still beating the rest of the industry in terms of sales growth. Is the sales growth is slower than it was last year? Yes. It still has a positive plus in front of it, and it\u2019s still better than the industry as a whole. Operator : Our next question comes from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom : Richard, on core-on-core three-year -- on a three-year basis, it looks like you guys showed a nice improvement from the last quarter. Can you unpack that for us a little bit across the four major categories? Richard Galanti : Well, I don\u2019t have all that detail in front of me. But generally speaking, the thing that was outsized in the biggest way in the first year or so of COVID was fresh. As you\u2019ll recall, with fresh, you had virtually no spoilage, and you had much higher labor productivity. So, you had huge -- you had 3-digit improvements in margins there. So, that\u2019s the comparison. And we\u2019ve talked about that in the last several quarters on a year-over-year basis compared to those two years, it\u2019s come down as a percent, still up from where it was pre-COVID. Other than that, there\u2019s all kinds of things that impact other departments. At the extreme, you have a small business, but in terms of our income statement, travel. Travel is almost a brokerage business where it\u2019s all margin -- a lot of it is margin. And that went way down, and now it\u2019s improving from where -- it\u2019s gone way down. So that helps you a little bit. But there\u2019s a lot of moving parts to that. I think fresh was the biggest outlier. Then, during supply chain things and everything else, there were impacts in certain departments or allocations, things like that. There was less -- I\u2019m just shooting from the hip here. There was less promotional activity in consumer electronics because of shortages of chips or electronics. And so, there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes. But overall, I would say fresh was the one that was most meaningful in that regard. Chuck Grom : And then on the LIFO charge, 28 basis points, I think you said; last quarter, it was 25. I guess, I was surprised that it wasn\u2019t higher given how much prices have moved up over the past 3 to 4 months. Can you just maybe just give us a refresh on the accounting for that? And what happens in the coming quarters as we start to lap the big charges from this year? Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, two things. Again, if you look sequentially in Q1, it was sub-$20 million; in Q2, it was sub-$40 million -- $30 million something, then $100 million something, then $200 million something. Part of that is, is -- the way we account for it is, at the end of the Q1, when we saw what the trend was, you then estimate what you believe it\u2019s going to be for the year, and pro rate a quarter of that or 12 weeks of that to that quarter. And that as it continues to increase, you [proration] (ph) adjusted on a year-to-date basis. So, that skews that a little bit. That\u2019s the way we\u2019ve done it historically in prior inflationary times. The other comment you asked about is it seemed like it\u2019d be even higher in Q4. The fact is, is we, too, thought halfway through the quarter, it would be higher than this. Part of that was if I bifurcated Q4 into the first 8 weeks and the second 8 weeks, the first 8 weeks showed a level of increase that would have required a larger LIFO charge. It seemed to, in some cases, flatten out a little bit during the last several weeks of the quarter, which meant that it came down from what our expectation was. So again, I think that is consistent with I mentioned about we\u2019re seeing a little light at the end of the tunnel. I\u2019m not just -- and there\u2019s little [Technical Difficulty] some of the buyers about a couple of items going down in price. And you can rest assured that our partners are calling the suppliers. As you said, the price went up because of steel prices. Well, steel prices are down. What gives? And so we\u2019ll continue to do that. But it\u2019s a slow road. And -- but we are, again, seeing a little bit of improvement at least in the second half of the fourth quarter. And we\u2019ll see where it goes from here. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Brandon Cheatham : [Indiscernible] Cheatham on for Paul. Thanks for taking our question . I want to dig in on the inventory piece a little bit, up about 26%. How much of that is you categorize as general merch? You had some pretty big competitors that have been trying to clear some of their general merch, as I\u2019m sure everyone knows. So, as you kind of reach holiday, can you give us a sense of where you are for general merch inventory? Any plans to kind of further discount there to try and get leaner? Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, first of all, without being too specific, there\u2019s a decent chunk in there that I would call deep freeze from last year. My example I\u2019ve used when talking to people is the Christmas trees that retail for $150 to $400. And they came in after Christmas or essentially after Christmas. And the good news is, is that they don\u2019t really change in style. And they\u2019re now -- and if you go to Costco, you\u2019re going to see it on the floor. And the -- if you add in the cost of holding them and a little cost of interest, I think they\u2019re still a little cheaper than the ones we added to the inventory this year. So in a perverse way, that one didn\u2019t hurt us that example other than we don\u2019t like to have extra inventory. And so, there are some seasonal things that came in late. Probably a bigger piece of the delta is us building up inventory, particularly on big and bulky and fulfillment -- both e-com fulfillment and big and bulky. The last part is early holiday. We did consciously bring in some stuff. Part of it was not knowing what was happening with supply chain and how many weeks of delay at each item was. We bought stuff in consciously a little early. And then as I mentioned, supply chain has improved a little. That\u2019s helped you. So again, there\u2019s things that have helped it and hurt it -- increased it or reduced it. The other thing that\u2019s increased a little bit, even some things like seasonal things like air conditioning and fans, which was -- we had a very strong season, but there were some delays in getting that stuff in. That will be a small impact from a seasonal standpoint going forward. But net-net, I think that while the 26% number was relatively same at year-over-year Q3 end -- Q3 year-over-year and at Q4 end, again, in talking with Ron and Claudine and the merchants, and again, seeing what we\u2019ve seen just in the last 2 or 3 weeks, it\u2019s going in the right direction, and nobody likes it. I think that one other difference is that -- compared to some of the other bigger retailers, our inventory is more specific. Like if we get a lot of -- if we have a bunch of air conditioners or a bunch of furniture, it\u2019s -- we may have to hold on to it, but it\u2019s not a whole variety of different things. And so, we -- while we have had some additional markdowns, nothing huge -- no big outsized numbers relative to what we would normally expect. So, a little bit increase, but nothing material. Brandon Cheatham : Got you. And so, you\u2019re bringing holiday up a little earlier than you otherwise would. And some of that more seasonal air conditioners and fans you mentioned, you might hold those over to spring time? Is that right? Richard Galanti : We will. Yes. That\u2019s easy. And the good news, again, call it, lucky, 2.5 years ago when we acquired Innovel, which is we call Costco Logistics, we added 10 -- or 20 million square feet between the MDOs and DCs. But added 10 million of big space, the 1 million square foot space to the roughly 10 million or 12 million of depot space we have. So, we were -- that was fortuitous in that regard. . Operator : Our next question comes from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Hi. Thanks. Kelly Bania from BMO. Richard, just wanted to touch on executive penetration. Line item continues to impress. I think it\u2019s the biggest quarterly jump in the model that I can see. But I guess my question is as you look at that kind of cohort of Gold Star customers today, is there anything different about that customer profile, demographics or otherwise that makes you can\u2019t -- makes you think you can\u2019t have the same success in converting those customers up to executive over time? Richard Galanti : Well, I think -- we think we will. I mean what used to be asked -- the question that used to be asked about millennials or Gen X and then millennials and the Gen Z, we tend to see the same type of trends that are age and, arguably, income-dependent. Also, during these last several years, we\u2019ve continued to get better at talking you into signing up -- selling you on the value of that executive member upfront. So, we\u2019ve seen increased penetration there, too. The other thing, of course, that helps is when we add it to a new country, I think in the past 2 years, we added it to Japan and Korea. And so, we have it, of course, in the U.S., Mexico, Canada and the UK. And so, we\u2019ve already gotten the big countries, if you will, in terms of number of locations. And I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be another country, too, we add it to over time as those countries grow. So no, I think we\u2019ve done a better job of doing it, starting with. Years ago, you came in and we asked you what you wanted and if you said Gold Star, that\u2019s what you got. Now we actually try to share with you what\u2019s the value of it, and we\u2019ve done a better job with that. Kelly Bania : And just to maybe follow up on the container pricing. I think you mentioned maybe some relief starting there. I guess the question is just, have you learned anything about your business over the past few years, really kind of focusing on discretionary imports and the strategy, the charter ships that you might keep longer term, or do you expect to kind of go back to kind of everything you were doing pre-pandemic from that perspective? Richard Galanti : I think the biggest thing we\u2019ve learned is that really from the source of origin of these items. If you go back to even when tariffs were placed in, whatever, \u201816 or \u201817 or whenever that was on China, and there were certain items that were moved from manufacturers in China, those same manufacturers who may have had facilities in other neighboring countries. Where we could and where they could, that was moved to get around some of those tariffs. And so, you learn through that process. We certainly learned through the last couple of years the challenges with containers, not to say that we can change some of it. But I think we try to -- to the extent you can, you try to spread it out a little more. You try to not depend on one port. And certainly, we\u2019ve learned all those things. And we learned that we can continue to make mistakes along the way, too. Operator : Our next question comes from Oliver Chen of Cowen. Oliver Chen : The industry is seeing so much inventory and the wrong kind of inventory. What are your thoughts on the promotions that you\u2019re seeing? And how you\u2019re thinking about pricing? And any thoughts on the nature of your portfolio? You always offer such sharp prices. On inflation at the end of the tunnel, second, Richard, maybe you could elaborate on that. That sounds very nice. And lastly, on... Richard Galanti : Hold on. Let\u2019s do one question at a time, so I don\u2019t forget. Yes. Supply becomes more plentiful. There\u2019s more promotions. I remember last year or the last couple of years, again, given shortages in electronics, we saw -- we and the industry saw a lot less promotional activity being afforded retailers from the manufacturers on TVs. There was no need to do that. And we\u2019re starting to see some of those promotional activities come back. Other than that, also, one of the things that we like is our multi-vendor mailer, both the existing one as well as other promotional things, we do like that online and direct. And those had to be changed in some ways because of shortages or allocations of inventory. A lot of times in those types of MVMs, you\u2019ve got a lot of high items like promotional things like TVs as well as huge high sales volume items like paper goods and things like that. And you\u2019re looking at the paper goods as well. There were shortage of those along the way. So, we\u2019ve learned how to change those and maximize them in the ways -- in the best ways we can and figure out how to use those monies -- work with the vendors as well, the suppliers to figure out how to use that money in the best way. And we -- that\u2019s again an iterative evolving process. Second question? Oliver Chen : Yes. On inflation, just light at the end of the tunnel and some green shoots there that you\u2019re seeing? Richard Galanti : Yes. Well, again, anecdotally, when we talked to the buyers, they\u2019re starting to see a few examples, whether it\u2019s something like outdoor, patio, furniture or barbecue grill where steel prices are coming down, and we\u2019re reminded by Craig and Ron or the buyers reminded at the budget meeting when prices were going up, make sure you understand why they\u2019re going up. Is it -- what piece of it is raw material costs? What piece of it is freight costs? And when these things come down, you better be on the phone with them calling them saying, when are going to get a reduction? And so I think in part because of our limited selection -- our limited number of SKUs and a huge volume, I think our buyers know pretty darn well a lot of the cost components of these things. And that, I think, bodes well for us. But again, at the end of the day, we are seeing -- I think it is a little light at the end of the tunnel. Certainly, container rates have come down. Container shortages have improved. The port delays have improved, all that things go into it. And as raw material prices come down -- and FX generally helps you and hurts you. When we report a foreign company\u2019s earnings in U.S. dollars, and the currency has gone down 10%, it\u2019s 10% less earnings that we report. But at the same token, since we\u2019re using U.S. dollars in a lot of things, not just in the U.S. to buy different supplies and raw materials from other places, that helps you a little bit. And again, I think it\u2019s -- could something happen tomorrow to change this? Sure. But at least we\u2019re seeing the things going -- starting to go in the right direction. Hopefully, that bodes better for not just us, but everyone. Oliver Chen : Okay. And lastly, now it\u2019s time to talk about Generation A, analysts. What about the data science team, Richard? I know you hired that team. And what kind of progress or things we should look for there as well as any highlights you want to give us for your digital strategies on the horizon? Richard Galanti : You know what, I -- in my old age, I forgot to get any detail on that, but I\u2019ll do that on the next quarter. But generally speaking, it\u2019s been a couple of years since we brought in a VP of Data Analytics, and he has built a sizable team. And a lot of things they\u2019re working on is to have better visibility. As simple as we are, we still need visibility into things that we have done historically, just not on the sales side, but on the operating our business side, greatly reducing -- the intent is to greatly reduce the buyer\u2019s time and doing their own spreadsheets, if you will, and simplifying that. And so, we\u2019re doing a lot of activities like that. And in terms of the data analytics to drive more business, that\u2019s still to come. We think we\u2019re doing okay right now with -- but the first effort of this area is on improving the data that both our data -- our operators, our buyers, our traffic people get. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Two questions. First on gas and then the credit card. On the gas, I guess, I\u2019m curious, it looked like it\u2019s -- well, we know it\u2019s a negative mix shift, really helped ancillary. That was the one thing where gas profit or penny profit was up. Can you just remind us of that dynamic that as gasoline prices fall, how high penny profit can go during that period? And also remind us the traffic-driving relationship to gasoline. Richard Galanti : Well, the old story was is when prices -- given that we turn our inventory about every day on average and the average in the U.S. gas stations is like every 8 or 9 days. So, on average, we\u2019re buying -- the other guys buying it four days [Technical Difficulty] four days earlier. So, when prices are going up each day, when spot prices are going up stay, it\u2019s costing us a little more because we bought it today at the highest price versus 4 days ago. I\u2019m being very simple here. And when it\u2019s going down, just the other happens that we make more money when it goes down. I think part of that story has been thrown away because it seems that not only us, but the supermarket retailers and other discount retailers that operate large numbers of gas stations, they\u2019ve been able to use it to -- as prices went up or went -- even went down a little bit, they didn\u2019t go down as fast as perhaps they could have been, which gives us, in our view, an ability to make a little more and still be the most competitive, in fact, in our view, gotten a little wider. So I think overall gasoline as a retail business has gotten more profitable in the last couple, three years. And it\u2019s -- that profitability has been even exacerbated a little bit by what\u2019s going on with inflation and the headline news that prices are skyrocketing. And even when you see gas -- while the gas prices have come down at the pump, it seemed like that lagged -- crude oil coming down. Why isn\u2019t it coming down faster? And so we still are very much, in our view, the most competitive out there. And arguably, we\u2019ve been able to use that to be -- continue to be more competitive elsewhere as well. Greg Melich : And is it still 50% roughly that you think go to the club when they get gas? Richard Galanti : Well, historically, a little over 50 of every people -- yes. Historically, a little over 50 of every 100 people that filled up with gas came in to shop. That actually right when gas peaked right after the Ukraine-Russia thing, for a couple of weeks there, it went down to like 20%, 25% because people are topping off their tanks for fear that there was going to be a gasoline shortage. If you\u2019re as old as me, you remember the mid-70s. But memory utilization also went up. What we\u2019re seeing now is that a little slightly over 50 or slightly under 50. Greg Melich : Got it. So that\u2019s a normal... Richard Galanti : But more members are using it. Yes. Greg Melich : Got it. And then my last is on the credit card. Just update us on anything you can on the credit card penetration, the behaving of the portfolio, the sort of lift percentage of tender on the card, sort of the lift you get outside of the club with it, just given it seems to be a key part of the renewal rate, I would imagine, continuing to enhance... Richard Galanti : Sure. Auto renewal -- it\u2019s not just on the Citi Visa co-brand card. It\u2019s on any Visa card here and on a Mastercard that we worked out a deal with a bank and Mastercard in Canada. So on co-brand, not only the fact that we do it exclusive, which, arguably, gives us purchasing power to lower the merchant fee and to drive the reward to the member. There\u2019s typically co-brand cards, there\u2019s revenue share. So, every time that card is used outside, we share in that revenue. While we pay for some of the rewards, that\u2019s more than offset -- that\u2019s offset by the revenue sharing. So, it continues to be -- fiscal \u201822 is a great year for the card in terms of increasing penetration and increasing rewards to our members and very -- in our view, a very favorable effective merchant fee to us, which we don\u2019t disclose. Greg Melich : And the auto renewal is up to what percentage? Richard Galanti : Auto renewal, I don\u2019t... Unidentified Company Representative : Mid to high-50s in the U.S.. Richard Galanti : In the -- U.S. number, mid to high-50s signed up for auto renewal. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Benedict of Baird. Peter Benedict : You kind of ended your prepared remarks, you said kind of seasonal going well. Maybe you can elaborate on that. Are you talking about fall seasonally, you\u2019re talking Halloween? Just what were you trying to express with that? Richard Galanti : Well, part of what I\u2019m trying to express is, is that while inventories were up 26% year-over-year, we\u2019re starting to feel good that they\u2019re going in the right direction with the efforts that we put forth. And part of the -- by the strength is, once we also indicated -- I mentioned in the call or somebody did that seasonal -- we brought in, in some cases, seasonal early just because the nature of the delivery dates, so we want to make sure we add it in. What we\u2019ve seen so far is Halloween is doing well, and Christmas is doing well. And so we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen in the last few weeks. Peter Benedict : Okay. Perfect. And then just kind of maybe a bigger picture, maybe historical question. Just talk to us about how your business has kind of performed in past recessions. And maybe what do you see from your members as you think back? What are the early indications when we\u2019re going into a tougher environment? Is it the business member that starts to slow? Is it traffic? Is it certain categories? I don\u2019t know. Just curious kind of your perspective as we\u2019re in this unique time in the economy. Richard Galanti : Look, I don\u2019t remember all of them, but I remember the \u201808, \u201809 one was that at the end of that year, which went from a recession to the Great Recession. It lasted for 4 or 5 years. And that -- as we entered it, and it was pretty quick when it happened. We saw some, like, a slowdown in seasonal things, which were, like, barbecue grills and patio furniture and things like that. Big ticket -- those kind of big-ticket items slowed. And if I go back to my notes, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve talked about we had an extra -- x million dollars of markdowns, just -- to get through that stuff, so we didn\u2019t have it lingering after the first of the calendar year. Other than that, generally speaking, one of the nice things about our model is, is we\u2019ve done well in good times and bad times. And in good times, of course, people have money to spend. And in bad times, people want to save. And in a perverse way, while none of us ever wish COVID on anybody, from a bottom line standpoint, while it impacted some businesses negatively, it\u2019s impacted many more of our businesses positively, and we\u2019ve seen to keep some of that market share. Restaurants are reopening. People -- as what I read that people are still eating more at home than they did pre-COVID. But even within that, we felt that we built some additional market share during that. So I think overall, we did find -- and I think the good news is, even in bad times, we don\u2019t view ourselves as having to be as conservative as perhaps others might be. We don\u2019t take big reductions in buying -- and open to buys or anything in that regard. If I do remember back in \u201809, \u201810 or \u201808, \u201809 with the barbecue grills and patio furniture, midway through the new year, and it was clear it was going to continue to be a recession, whether it was Craig or Jim, prior to Craig or both, the reminder to the buyers was don\u2019t bring down price points. We\u2019ve driven value at greater value and greater price points, if we want to be a little conservative, fine, but don\u2019t think it\u2019s not going to do, go forward based on the assumption that we\u2019re providing the best value out there. Peter Benedict : Right. No, no. That\u2019s helpful. I think -- as I recall, maybe your renewal rates actually went up during that Great Recession as well. So definitely\u2026 Richard Galanti : Yes, they certainly have now -- auto renewal is certainly a piece of that. Peter Benedict : Yes. Exactly. Last question just on traffic, Richard. I think, 5% or so on the quarter. I think August maybe was maybe a shade below 3% in the U.S. Just how do you guys think about that? I mean, is there a traffic level that you guys don\u2019t like to see it go below, obviously, more traffic better than less? But just kind of curious how you think about that. Richard Galanti : Yes. Part of the challenge of -- in the last couple of years is every time something happens, some of it hits the fan. And it was like the Omicron surge or the Delta surge, and you\u2019ll see things change dramatically in a short period of time. Look, at the end of the day, whenever we see any possibility of something weak, we figure out how to drive sales. And you usually drive sales by greater values, hot items. And that goes back to the comment I made earlier about the multi-vendor mailers. That\u2019s the one thing I think we\u2019re good at, is figuring out how to drive people into the door with hot items, and that\u2019s helped us as well. David here just shared with me. One of the other interesting things, we see more Monday through Thursday shopping than on the weekends -- vice versa. We see less Monday through Thursday and more on the weekends because people are going back to work. But -- so during the week, we go, what\u2019s going on? And then by the end of the week, we go, phew. Operator : Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. John Heinbockel : Do you guys have any sense of demographics by Gold Star versus executive? And the thought being, when you think about the structure going forward, could you leave Gold Star where it is, take executive up and maybe at an executive plus, right, that either has more than 2% or some other features, right, so you\u2019re catering to people through the income spectrum? Richard Galanti : Yes. I think we try to -- as you know, John, I think we try to keep things simple. We talk about all kinds of things, but we always come back home and say, let\u2019s do this and keep it simple. One of the issue -- one of the other issues about doing a higher level of membership than the executive is the sales taxability in some states that is currently non-sales taxable, but at a certain level, states say it\u2019s sales taxable, not just the increment, but the whole membership fee. So that\u2019s something we take into account also. At this juncture, I think we still went towards simple. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then secondly, when you think about -- I think somebody asked right about inflation going forward. A lot of what we hear is that it\u2019ll be sticky, right? Higher for longer. As it comes down, what -- how do you think vendors are likely to respond? We\u2019re not going to see list price decreases, right? We\u2019re probably going to see more trade money step up. So, when you think about your participation in that and your ability to take advantage of that, how do you guys think about that? Richard Galanti : Well, again, I think, again, in terms of the stickiness, wages are still the culprit. I think, again, we\u2019re in as good a position, if not better than anybody, given that our buying power per item is off the-charts high compared to anybody else and our buyers focus on the detailed components of it. So, there will be stickiness. Read articles every day or on television or in the periodicals, the journal about some CBG companies that just raised their prices, and they\u2019re sticky. Well, we\u2019ll try to unstick them, but I\u2019m sure some of it will stick and some of it won\u2019t. But I think, again, we\u2019re in the best position when you think about we\u2019ve got lots of $50 million and $100 million and $200 million and even higher items and even a handful of billion-dollar SKUs. So we think we are pretty good at figuring that out with our suppliers, not only just to say, hey, the price went down on this commodity or this supply cost component, but also on figuring out how to make things more efficient. I think, we all -- one of the things somebody asked earlier about what have we learned on the freight and trade side, container side, port side, I think we\u2019ve learned through manufacturing as good as we think we are. There are things that I hear at the budget meetings all the time about how on $100 million, $200 million, $500 million SKUs, how they\u2019re taking costs. So -- which right now meant that the price increase was lower than it would have been. But now they took cost out by changing the production line or eliminating some of the insight packaging. And that\u2019s part of ESG as well as you know how to lower the cost. And again, I don\u2019t know if anybody does it as well as we do, given that we\u2019re focused on such bigger volumes of an item. Operator : Our next question comes from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America Securities. Robby Ohmes : Maybe a follow-up on John\u2019s question. So the kind of signs of relief and inflation you\u2019re seeing, can you give an example as -- in the kind of food and sundry side of the business? Are you seeing some relief on the food inflation side? Richard Galanti : Yes. I\u2019m getting some help here. Certain commodities, like corn, are coming down. I mentioned -- resin is coming down a little bit. So all these things are impacting a little bit. But in some cases, the supplier are committed at the higher priced -- we work with our suppliers. And the more transparent they are with us, which we feel they are very transparent, we work together on that. In some cases, even when commodity price has gone down fast, if they\u2019ve committed to the next three months at a higher price because they -- we all were fearful it was going even higher, we work with them on that. But -- so I think, again, it\u2019s, at this juncture, anecdotal, and I can\u2019t give you any specific examples. Robby Ohmes : Got you. And then just a quick follow-up. I think you mentioned optical was down. I apologize. Has optical been weaker for a while, or what -- or did something change there? Richard Galanti : I think the big thing there was a promotion we did a year ago in the quarter. Okay. So we did a big promotion a year ago. And this year, we did -- we do a big promotion on lots of things all the time. But we did a big promotion this year on -- at a slightly later date. And so, we\u2019re now seeing it. Yes. So it\u2019s more timing than anything on that example. Operator : Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli of Truist Securities. Scot Ciccarelli : So, Costco tends to put a line in the sand on pricing with some items. Obviously, the hot dog and soda versus chicken offerings, for example, despite today\u2019s inflationary pressures. But your margins are actually holding in pretty well. So I guess, the question is, are there other areas where you\u2019re being even more aggressive than normal on the pricing side? And then, the flip side of that is, what categories are you guys using to maybe harvest some extra margin to offset the presumed margin squeeze from holding the line of sand on pricing? Richard Galanti : Lightning just struck me. No. We don\u2019t -- we really don\u2019t look at it that way. I think, the thing I mentioned earlier about there are some businesses that are doing well with margin like gas business on a smaller way -- in the travel business, those things help us be more aggressive in other areas, or as you mentioned, hold the price on the hot dog and the soda a little longer, forever. And -- but at the end of the day, no, I don\u2019t think we necessarily look to find places where we can harvest margin. But we are -- there are different areas. Again, the fresh foods business -- the strength in sales for a two-year period where over two years, you had 30% and 40% -- 20-plus-percent increase each year. The abnormity of the improvement in the bottom line, even now as we\u2019re getting some of that back now, still net-net, were better than we were two years ago. So all those things help that process. Scot Ciccarelli : But, on a go-forward basis, if you\u2019re really not looking to take any extra margins some other categories, should we presume that margins may actually start to drop on a year-over-year basis? Richard Galanti : Well, we don\u2019t provide guidance, but we look at the bottom -- the top line first and how does that impact the bottom line. And historically, years ago was we want to raise margins by lowering prices, but keeping a little of it. That was the old saying, you\u2019re in an inflationary environment, and that changes a little bit. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s all about driving volume. If we can incrementally get another percentage point of comp sales, that does more than any kind of harvesting we would ever want to do, which we don\u2019t do. Richard Galanti : Okay. I think that\u2019s it on our end. Thank you very much, everyone. We\u2019re all here to answer some additional questions, and talk to you soon. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And please be advised that this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And now at this time, I'll turn the call over to Costco's CFO, Richard Galanti. Richard, please go ahead. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Bo, and good afternoon to, everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal '23, the 12 weeks ended this past November 20. Reported net income for the quarter was $1.364 billion or $3.07 per diluted share. That compared to $1.324 billion or $2.98 a share last year. This year's results included a charge of $93 million pre-tax or $0.15 per share, primarily related to downsizing our charter shipping activities and a tax benefit of $53 million or $0.12 per diluted share related to stock-based compensation. Last year's results included an asset write-off of $118 million pre-tax or $0.20 per diluted share and a tax benefit of $91 million or $0.21 a share related to stock-based compensation. Additionally, the strength of the U.S. dollar resulted in our foreign company earnings translating into fewer U.S. dollars. With 25% to 30% of our earnings generally -- generated outside of the United States, this negatively impacted earnings by about $0.12 per share. In terms of sales, net sales for the first quarter increased 8.1% or $53.44 billion versus $49.42 billion reported last year. On a comparable sales basis during the first quarter, reported U.S. sales increased over the 12 weeks 9.3%; and excluding gas inflation and FX, 6.5%; Canada, 2.4%; reported 8.3% increase, ex gas inflation and FX. Other International reported minus 3.1%; excluding gas inflation, FX, plus 9.1%. So you have all told, 6.6% reported for the company, and ex gas inflation and FX of 7.1%. E-commerce, by the way, was reported of minus 3.7% and a minus 2%, excluding FX. In terms of first quarter comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 3.9% worldwide and up 2.2% in the U.S. Our average transaction size was up 2.6% worldwide and 6.9% U.S. during the first quarter. And foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by a little over 3%, while gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 2.5%. Moving down the income statement. Membership fee income reported in the quarter, our membership fee income came in right at $1 billion. That's $54 million or 5.7% higher than last year's reported number of $946 million. Again, the relative weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, excluding the impact of FX, we're assuming flat FX year-over-year, that $54 million number would have been increased by $32 million, and the membership on an adjusted basis would have been a little over 9% year-over-year on flat FX. In terms of renewal rates, at first quarter-end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates were 92.5% compared to 92.4% a quarter ago. And worldwide rate came in both at this quarter-end and the previous quarter-end, the same level at 90.4%. We ended first quarter with 66.9 million paying household members and 120.9 million cardholders, both up 7% versus last year, and recognize we added about 22 units over the course of that last year. So that was about just under 3% of that increase. At Q1 end, paid executive memberships were right at 30 million, an increase of 904,000 during the 12 weeks or 75,000 a week during the first quarter. Executive members now represent 45% of our paid membership and just under 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement to gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the first quarter was lower year-over-year by 45 basis points and lower by 21 basis points, excluding gas inflation. And as I'll explain in a minute, the 93% pre-tax charge, excluding that 93% -- $93 million charge we took in the quarter, gross margin ex gas inflation would have been only down 3 basis points. As I always ask you, jot down the following numbers, two columns and six line items. The first column is reported during the first quarter, a year-over-year delta change in basis points, and the second column, excluding gas inflation. On a core merchandise basis, we reported in the first quarter, minus 52 basis points; and ex gas inflation, minus 31 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 23% on a reported basis and plus 30%; 2% reward, minus 2 and minus 5; LIFO plus 3 and plus 3; Other, that's the $93 million charge, minus 17 and minus 18. So all told, again, a reported basis was 45, ex gas inflation, 21. So starting with the core. Core merchandise\u2019s contribution to gross margin on a reported basis was lower by 52 basis points year-over-year and lower by 31 basis points ex gas inflation. In terms of the core margin on their own sales, in the first quarter, our core or core gross margin, if you will, was also lower by 31 basis points, with food and sundries being up a little bit, offset by non-foods and fresh foods being down. Fresh foods was down, as you know, for the last couple of years, it's been particularly strong, and it's come down a little bit. In addition, we are looking to hold prices on some of those price points despite inflated costs in some of the fresh food categories. Ancillary and other business gross margins were higher by 23 and higher by 30 basis points ex gas inflation in the quarter, with gas, business centers and travel up year-over-year, offset in part by e-comm, food courts and optical. Our 2% reward, minus 2 basis points; reported, minus 5%, excluding gas inflation, implying higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO, plus 3 basis points. We had a very small LIFO charge this year, but lapped a $14 million charge in Q1 last year. You recall last year, during the four quarters, we had LIFO charges in excess of $400 million pre-tax with a small amount that $14 million in the first quarter over $100 million in Q3 and over $200 million in Q4. So we'll see what inflation does this year. Hopefully, it will continue to -- its current trends in the right direction. Other, the minus 17 and 18 basis points reported in ex gas inflation. This is the $93 million charge, as mentioned in the earnings release, mostly related to downsizing our charter shipping activities. Over a year after COVID began, you will recall that the supply chain challenges related to shortages of the containers and shipping delays greatly intensified with container, freight and shipping rate skyrocketing. It was in Q4 of 2021 on our earnings call that we mentioned our initial leasing of 3 ships and several thousand containers to help mitigate these challenges. Later, we added 4 additional vessels and additional needed containers with commitments made for up to three years. Our objectives at the time were twofold : first, to increase the ability for more timely shipping and arrival of overseas merchandise. This allowed us to better stay in stock and drive sales; and second, to reduce some of the skyrocketing shipping and associated container costs. We achieved those objectives for a period of time. Over the course of a year, 1.5 years, we controlled the shipping and delivery of nearly 50,000 containers, many that would have been greatly delayed and at an estimated savings as compared to the then current shipping container costs of somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000 per container. That, of course, fluctuated. Now with a dramatic improvement in shipping times and much lower shipping and container costs, it made sense to downsize our commitment and lower prices for our members Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the first quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 35 basis points, coming in at a 920 compared to a year ago 955. And that plus 35 basis point improvement would be plus 13 basis point improvement, excluding gas inflation. Again, writing down six line items and two columns. First column being reported, second ex gas inflation. During the first quarter, our core operations was lower or better by 8 basis points, plus 8 then; without gas inflation, minus 9; central zero and minus 3; stock compensation, plus 3 and plus 1; preopening zero and zero; Other, plus 24 and plus 24; for a total first column reported year-over-year reported SG&A plus 35 or lower by 35 basis points and ex gas inflation lower by 13. Now going through those numbers, the core operations component of SG&A was again lower by 8 basis points reported, but higher by 9, excluding impact of gas inflation. These results include three sets of wage increases that were done in the past year plus as well as a little lower sales results in Q1 as compared to the prior quarter. Still increases, but a little lower than the prior quarter. Central was flat or zero and higher by 3, ex gas inflation. Stock comp, again, a little lower number in stock comp as a percent, so it came down, improved a little bit. Preopening, no impact. And the other, the 24 basis points you recall last year in Q1, this consisted of an asset write-off totaling $118 million pre-tax, which impacted the SG&A line last year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $34 million this year, down $5 million or down from $39 million last year. And interest income and other for the quarter was higher by 11 year-over-year, $53 million versus $42 million a year ago. Interest income was higher year-over-year, offset by unfavorable FX. Overall, reported pre-tax income in the quarter was up 4%, coming in at $1.77 billion, compared to $1.696 billion a year ago. And excluding the charges described earlier in both years, pre-tax income was up around 3%. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q1 was 23.0% compared to 20.7% Q1 last year, so a little higher this year. Both years' tax rates benefited from the tax treatment of stock-based compensation, as mentioned earlier. The fiscal '23 effective tax rate, excluding these discrete items -- this discrete item, is currently projected to be between 26% and 27%. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, we plan to open a net of 24 units this year, 27 openings, including 3 relocations, so net of 24. In the first quarter, the net of that 24 included 7. We planned 3 more in Q2, 4 in Q3 and 10 in Q4. In the first quarter, we opened, as I mentioned, 7 net new warehouses, 4 were in the U.S. and one each was in Korea, our first in New Zealand and our first in Sweden. Additionally, last week, we opened another building in the U.S. And just yesterday, we opened our 14th location in Australia, our second on the country's West Coast in or near Perth. In fiscal '23, again, 27 total new openings, including 3 locations for a net of 24. Of the net 24, it's made up of 15 in the U.S. and 9 in Other International, including our third and fourth locations in China. Regarding CapEx. In the first quarter, CapEx was approximately $1.06 billion. And our estimate for the entire fiscal year is CapEx of somewhere in the $3.8 billion to $4.0 billion range. Moving to e-commerce. E-commerce, as we mentioned in the press release, on a reported basis was -- for the quarter, year-over-year sales were minus 3.7 and minus 2 ex FX. Including sales -- what we don't include in this number is our sales through like same-day delivery for fresh foods with our partners like Instacart, which we don't include those, and they are fulfilled in our warehouse. Our e-comm comps, ex FX, would have been if we included it in the positive low single digits. Stronger departments in terms of year-over-year percentage increases were tickets and gift cards, tires, candy and health and beauty aids. The largest e-comm merchandise department majors, which includes consumer electronics and appliances, which represents over 40 -- close to 40% to 50% of our -- over 40% of our e-com volume was down in the high single digits. Subsequent to quarter end, we did have our two biggest e-comm selling days in our company history, both on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Now a few comments regarding inflation. Recall, we've seen some minor improvements in a few areas. Hopefully, continuing the comment I made last quarter's earnings call, a little light at the end of the tunnel, but it's still little. Recall last quarter in fourth quarter, we estimated that year-over-year price inflation was about 8%. In the first quarter, we estimate the equivalent year-over-year inflation number in the range of 6% to 7%. Food and sundries is still up more than non-foods, but overall, a little better level than a quarter ago for the company. And commodity costs are mostly coming down, whether it's corn flour, sugar and butter or even some things like steel. A few things are up, but overall, we're seeing a little bit of a trend, but we'll keep you posted. Switching over to inventory levels. Recall that our total inventory in both -- at the end of Q3 and at the end of Q4 on a year-over-year basis were up 26% year-over-year. I'm happy to report that good progress was made during the first quarter of this fiscal year. Our increase as of Q1 end dropped to a 10% year-over-year increase, largely driven by an estimated 6% to 7% inflation and about just under 2% year-over-year unit growth. So inventories, while we still have some pockets of a little over inventory, overall, we feel pretty good about it. As a reminder, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, January 1 on Thursday, January 5, after the market closes. With that, I will open it up to Q&A and turn it back over to Bo. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question this afternoon from Simeon Gutman at Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Richard, I want to start with the short-term question. November, the slowdown in the stacks. Is there anything tip of the iceberg there, macro merchandising? Is there something obvious? I mean you were living in pretty rarefied air, but curious if there's anything notable. Richard Galanti : No, I think the biggest thing, as I've said a couple of times in a quiet way, it rains on all of us during these tougher times, particularly with bigger ticket discretionary items. We're comparing against some huge increases a year ago, frankly, over the last two or three years, as you know. And that's where we've seen some of the slowdown. As I mentioned, e-comm consumer electronics and appliances, as I mentioned, was down high singles. I think in line was also down some amount. So that's where a big chunk of it is. When we look at food and sundries, that actually tends to be relatively strong for us. So overall, I think it's impacting us a little bit with what's going on out there. I think it is a combination of compared to very strong stuff a year ago as well as the fact that big ticket discretionary has a little bit of weakness. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And maybe just a two-part follow-up. One is just related to that answer. Does those two couple of days, I don't know if you can judge enough from it, does it bring you back to some type of trend line? Or it sounds like your tone is there's still some pressure? And then the real follow-up is on gas gross profits. If you just think about the movement of the lap throughout this fiscal year, does it progressively get harder through the year in terms of the lap? And then can you highlight to us which quarter has the highest cents per gallon lap throughout the rest of the year? Richard Galanti : Yes. I have a couple of people in the room smiling. Of course, I can't tell you all that. But at the end of the day, first of all, if you look at our November reported numbers, the fact that those two dates -- those two high dates on e-com were in the last week. Keep in mind, e-comm is still a little under 10% of our total company, but that helped a little bit relative to e-comm in the last 4 weeks that we reported. But overall, look, we don't know what kind of trend it means. We feel pretty good about what we're doing in terms of driving sales. And as I mentioned, the food and sundries as we get past big-ticket discretionary purchases for the holidays, for Christmas and what have you, you'll have a higher penetration of some other things as well. As it relates to gas, for several quarters now, even beyond a year ago, we talked about the gas profitability for us and we believe our competitors -- other big chains of gas stations have made more in gas. And certainly, that's helped us use some of that to continue to hold prices where we can on some things. Who knows what the new normal is? What we know is that not only is gas more profitable than it has been in the past, and like I said the same thing a year ago, will that change at some point? Maybe. We don't know. So right now, it's good. And by the way, as we've mentioned a couple of times, we've seen strong gallon sales, and we're still taking market share. We -- when the U.S. gallon sales are generally close to flat, we're up in the 10% to 15% range in gallons. So we're driving people into the parking lot. And the fact that gallons of gas are profitable, that there's just a little bit more for us as well. So that's helped us. There's always things that are going to help us, and there's always going to be puts and takes. Operator : Thank you. We go next now to Chuck Grom at Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom : My question is on the LIFO charge. It looks like if it's a few basis points of a hit, that would back into about $30 million to $40 million. And I'm curious, I know you don't provide guidance, but knowing what you know now and if inflation holds at that, say, 6% level, would that be a good proxy for the charge, at least over the next couple of quarters? Richard Galanti : Well, I think, yes, LIFO was a slight pickup just because the dollar amount was less than the $14 million last year in the quarter. It's very slight. So if that continues, that would be good, and that would bode well. And you'd have -- I'm guessing you'd have a lot lower charge than $423 million, recognizing the big pickup was in Q3. The big hit was in Q3 and 4 when we saw the beginning of inflation rising. If inflation didn't go down, but it just stayed the same, in theory, you'd have no big charge. You have no additional charge. If it starts to go down from its peaks, that will have -- there'll be some LIFO income. Now mind you, some of that will be used for pricing as well. I mean, well, you know us. Chuck Grom : Yes. Okay. So what would you do to have the absolute dollar amount for the LIFO charge in the quarter for us? Richard Galanti : Yes. It was less than $1 million. Chuck Grom : Less than $1 million. Okay, great. And then on the ancillary line, you've had real good success there in back-to-back quarters and you outlined gas profitability, e-comm, food court. Is there one that's been more outsized over the past couple of quarters and that maybe we could think about over the next few quarters because it's been a nice improvement? Richard Galanti : Well, look, gas is just the sheer size of our gasoline business. It's been the biggest piece of that line for a few years. We have a -- it's a $30-plus billion -- on our $220-whatever-billion last year, we did in sales, I think a little over $30 billion was gas. So that's the big kahuna among all that stuff. Operator : We go next now to Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael Lasser : Richard, between the 31 basis point core-on-core gross margin discussion -- decrease for core on core gross margin, the discussion around giving up some shipping capacity to have a better price for your member, is the mindset of Costco right now as the economy enters a more difficult economic period, Costco is going to be stepping up price investments in order to gain market share? Richard Galanti : I think we continue just to remain competitive. You've known us long enough when asked who is our toughest competitor, we look in the mirror, and we say it's us. So I think that as we drive market share, part -- we believe that part of it at least is due to the fact that we've continued to be very competitive. And so I don't know if there's any change in that. We -- notwithstanding where our numbers come out, we're always trying to push more into lowering the prices or keeping the price increases going not as high as they could have been. I think fresh foods is a good example of that of late, where, again, we've held the price points on certain items despite inflated costs, mostly in the protein area and a little bit in the bakery area. Michael Lasser : And Richard, you've long talked about, the Costco model is driven, first and foremost, by sales, and the need to drive at least the mid-single-digit comp in order for the other parts of the P&L to work. So is the economy is entering a softer period where discretionary sales can be a little weaker and Costco's overall sales are going to be a little softer, should we be modelling and prognosticating just a lower overall earnings growth for Costco during this time as when we go to these factors? Richard Galanti : Well, good news is that's your job to model it. Look, at the end of the day, I think that the comment I made about big-ticket discretionary, while we sell big-ticket discretionary includes furniture, which we sell lawn and garden, patio, too, that's not right now at the holiday season necessarily. But that being said, there is a higher proportion of big ticket discretionary right now. And we're blessed in the sense that a big chunk of our business is fresh foods and food and sundries, which people have to eat. And as I mentioned, that has been strong throughout this. So I think overall, we'll probably still look at it in a positively relatively aggressive standpoint. Ultimately, when you talk about top line sales and if they're a little lower, what do we need? I think the question historically has always been asked, what do we need to have SG&A not go up as a percent of sales? And the view is -- and this is pre-inflation. The view is always you need something -- our best guess view is somewhere in the 4% to 5% comp range. If it falls below that, that will make SG&A a little bit of a challenge. That being said, we're pretty pragmatic, and we know how to use our margin as well. So I think overall, we'll continue to work entirely to drive top line sales and look at it for the long term. And we're not in any big way cutting back orders at this juncture, where we see some challenges with big-ticket discretionary? Does it come down a little? I think the keyword there is a little. And we\u2019re feeling very good about some of our business now despite what's going on out there. We're blessed that we think, again, I think as evidenced by gas and any food and sundries business, we're blessed by taking market share still. I think that's evidenced in our memberships and... Michael Lasser : Your answer was a lot better than my questions. Operator : We go next now to Rupesh Parikh at Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So just on the core-on-core decline of 31 basis points. I was hoping you provide more color just in terms of what's driving that decline in non-foods category? And then just related to the pressure on fresh foods. I know I think you've now lapped some of the last year, I think, fresh foods is also a headwind. So when do we lap some of the -- I guess, some of the efficiencies that you gained during the pandemic? Because I know you've given it back in recent quarters. So I'm trying to get a sense of when that pressure point could go away. Richard Galanti : I don't know exactly. I mean if we're three quarters of a year into it. I think if I recall, over the last two or three quarters, we've talked about like fresh being that way and probably exacerbated a little right now with the fact that we're trying to hold prices on some things that we think that, that's driving our sales. Beyond that -- I forgot the first part of the question now. Rupesh Parikh : Just on non-foods, any more color on... Richard Galanti : Oh, yes. I think that -- yes, fundamentally -- first of all, in terms of overall, it's fundamentally fresh and then some non- foods. Some of that has to do with some of the big ticket things. If you've been online and saw some things we did during not just the week of Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, but we did some -- anywhere from $100 to $500 off on, I think, $500 cash card, if you bought $3,000 or more of these items. And so we're getting rid of some of the reason that 26% year-over-year inventory increase went to 10% was we got rid of some of the stuff that we -- some things that we had deep freeze and some things that we had delayed shipping during the supply chain challenge. So we did take some more markdowns than normal as you would expect, to help get rid of that. And hopefully, that's not a pressure point going forward. Certainly, I don't think it will be as much. And again, there are so many moving parts to this equation. I wish it was as easy as each basis point we could explain. We try to give you the rounded numbers. But overall, again, I get back to we feel good about how we're doing competitively. And we certainly understand that big ticket discretionary things have shown a little weakness, in part, because of our strength from a year ago, and in part, it's got to be part of the economy. And the good news is we have a big chunks of our business that are fresh foods, food and sundries, health and beauty aids, gas, all those types of things. And even other things like that's small, but travel has come back really strong from a really weak place a couple of years ago. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then maybe just one additional question just on the membership fee hike. If we are in a weaker economic backdrop next year, does that at all impact how you guys are thinking about the timing of the membership fee hike? Richard Galanti : Well, it certainly goes into the thought process. We're still not even to the average of the last three increases in terms of timing between the last one and the next one. What we've said again, and I'll say again, is that our view is all the parameters, as it relates to member loyalty and value proposition that we've improved to our member we have no problem thinking about doing it and doing it ultimately. So it's a question of when, not if. But we feel that we're in a very strong competitive position right now. And if we have to wait a few months or several months, that's fine. And I'll be purposely coy on when that might be. Operator : We go next now to Paul Lejuez at Citi. Brandon Cheatham : It's Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. First one, I wanted to dig into the decision on holding the price on fresh. Are you seeing competitors do the same and that's why you reacted there? Or are you kind of trying to lead the charge there? And just curious like why make that decision since it seems like the consumer has been happy to take increased price, especially in fresh? Richard Galanti : The last thing you said there is exactly, I think, why we chose to do a little more there. We want to be the most competitive, and we can drive a lot of volume. And again, we're in it for the long term. And it's -- fresh is one of those unique areas where prices on many items do change almost weekly on some of those items. If not sooner, if not more quickly. And so our buyers are always looking at the, if you will, the supermarket ads as well as the other warehouse club ads, not literally ads, but what the pricing is, and we react to that. But we're also -- part of it is also consciously keeping the price on the chicken at $4.99, and keeping -- and those types of things, keeping the price on the hotdog. All those things go into that equation as well. But we know that, that can be a driver of business. Fresh, we got great stuff, and people do notice the price. In our view, people notice those prices differences. Brandon Cheatham : And just a quick follow-up. You have a large competitor that's been talking about increased members in the $100,000-plus income cohort. Obviously, it's not impacting your membership numbers, but I'm just wondering, do you see any impact on share of wallet or any thoughts there? Do you look at how many of your members might have additional memberships as well? Richard Galanti : Well, we don't -- what's that? No. Somebody in the room is telling me we were also up in terms of the average household incomes. So I think we're both seeing that. We know a lot of -- particularly of our executive -- our business members, in many cases, probably have both cards. They've always had both cards. And so no, we don't put our head in the sand as it relates to it, but we look at our numbers and how we're doing, and we've seen that the -- our penetration of higher income members has also benefited during this time. Operator : We'll go next now to Oliver Chen at Cowen. Richard Galanti : Before Oliver answers -- Oliver, before you ask a question, one other comment. One of the things that we have not done and don't plan to do is do a lot of promotional activities with our membership. And so that -- certainly, that will, in the short term, help drive membership, but we don't do a lot of that. Go ahead, Oliver. Oliver Chen : Regarding e-commerce and going forward, what are your thoughts? You're up against some tough compares, but as we model it on a longer-term basis, how should the growth rates evolve? And then as we think about non-food, you talked about it a lot, but do you expect the non-food percentage mix to change from the past? Or it will more normalize? And lastly, on the higher income consumer and gains there, would love for you to elaborate on what's happening? And if you're getting more luxury consumers in terms of higher income folks joining in the club? Richard Galanti : Sure. I wrote down non-food -- in terms of what's the new normal? Look, we don't know what the new normal is. I do know that we figure out how to drive total sales. I do know that over the last 2.5 years through COVID, people buying things for their home, whether it was indoor furniture, outdoor furniture, exercise equipment, electronics and appliances and it's even greater because of our acquisition in April of 2020 of the last mile, big and bulky delivery and installation arm from Sears, all that stuff has helped us dramatically. Look, a little bit is -- again, we don't know how much of it is just comparing against very strong numbers versus a little weakness. Our guess is a little above. We want to drive -- we always want to drive everything, but we want to drive more non-food things because you've got -- you don't need any extra space. If you're turning fresh foods at 50, 60 times a year or more, you're turning some non-food categories at 8 times a year. It's easy to go from 8 to 10 without any extra space in the building. So that's always been a goal of ours to drive both sides of the business, and we think we're pretty good at doing it. And this will be -- we'll find out what the answer is a year from now. On -- what was the other question? I'm sorry. Oliver Chen : On e-comm and the e-com long-term growth rate there. And then also the higher income membership. Richard Galanti : Sure. Okay. On e-comm, again, that is even more dramatic if you look at what e-com did. We essentially doubled e-comm over a 12-month period from about worldwide from about 8 billion to 16 billion in that probably three or four months into COVID and then going fast forward a year. So the last half of fiscal '20 and the first half of fiscal '21, we had pretty good numbers over the last year. That, of course, dramatically impacted in a good way from our acquisition of Innovel. And doing, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, pre that acquisition in the U.S., we did about a little over 2 million drops, and a drop is anything from dropping off a sofa to dropping off and installing a washer dryer or a refrigerator freezer and taking the old one away.  We've gone from a little over 2 million drops. In fiscal '22, we did a little over 4 million drops, 70% of which is on the site and this operation that we acquired. So we've had outsized growth on that. Helped also not only by the acquisition but COVID itself. So we're comparing against that now. We'll see where that goes. We think that e-commerce still long term. First of all, as you know, we still want you to get into the warehouse as well. That's what -- so long term, we still think right now, we want to grow the e-commerce. I would say our goal still is to grow it a little more than in line right now because so much of it has been benefited by big ticket items, which have shown some weakness that's impacting a little bit right now. So -- but long term, we want to still be even 9% or 10% of $240 billion or $250 billion business here is a big chunk of business. In terms of the last question, I'm sorry, I didn't write it down. Oliver Chen : Yes. I think of Costco is a luxury company, too. So what are your thoughts on getting the higher income consumers? And anything you're seeing with your existing consumers in terms of behavior because everybody is under a little bit of pressure as well? Richard Galanti : Well, again, someone in the room here showed me that I think the data that somebody had asked me about where Walmart had indicated, we're all looking at that same data. We too saw the metrics of a little bit higher percentage of higher income people coming in, notwithstanding the fact that we start with a higher percentage to start with. That's -- we try to trade you up. And you know the quality of our merchandise, and we'd much rather sell you a bigger ticket item with all the bells and whistles. So I think that -- it's the way we merchandise, and we're not looking to change that at this juncture. Operator : We go next now to Greg Melich of Evercore. Greg Melich : Richard, I'd just like to talk about how -- traffic seems to be growing closer to 2% now in the U.S. Is there anything specific going on there? Or we just need to get used to it as recycling lower gas prices and tough out the slower traffic? Richard Galanti : Perhaps. I mean we still think anything that's even in the low single digits is great. And we benefited clearly from -- over the course of the last year, we benefited, as I've seen in our membership sign-ups, more people coming in and the gas business driving that a little bit as well. And just during COVID, we had a higher than previously average tick up and new member sign-ups. And so that's probably subsiding a little bit at this juncture. But again, we feel good -- very good about where our renewal rates are and then the loyalty that our members have. And we're pretty good at keep trying to figure out ways to get them in. We're doing -- we do online e-mails that are in-line directed for hot items to come in only available in store. And so those are the things that we continue to do. Greg Melich : Got it. Could you update us on any private label extra gains that you're getting in this environment or trade down perhaps between proteins or anything like that worth calling out? Richard Galanti : We haven't seen -- last quarter, I mentioned a couple of things on the fresh side and the protein side that we actually saw strength in canned chicken and tuna, which was the comment that the buyers made saying that we're seeing -- to the extent that prices were skyrocketing and some fresh protein, we saw strength in canned protein. We don't see currently a lot of trade down on fresh. Prices have started to come down on some of those items as the underlying commodity costs have come down a little bit. KS penetration is up. Our critical senior is up. I don't have the exact number in front of me. I'm guessing it's about somewhere approaching 1 percentage point, but -- which is big when it's, I would say, over the last several years, it's probably been 0.5 percentage point. But -- so probably up a little more than normal, but -- and again, we had -- somebody asked us the question recently, are you seeing some trade down to private label? And we, of course, corrected them and said it's a trade up. Greg Melich : You also mentioned it's a housekeeping item, but I want to make sure I got the charge right. So you're basically running a check to reduce the size of a contract that was at a higher price. So when -- what's the payback period on that check? Do we see it over four quarters, two quarters, six quarters? Richard Galanti : Yes. It's a moving target, honestly. It's based on rates, frankly, and rates right now have come down dramatically. So that would be a year, it could be a little longer than a year or a little less than a year, depending on what happens tomorrow. Operator : We go next now to Peter Benedict of Baird. Peter Benedict : Hey, Richard. Just on new member sign-ups, you kind of mentioned it a little bit there in response to Greg's question. But just maybe talk about new member sign-up trends. Holistically, what you're seeing, anything U.S. versus maybe some of these international markets you've been entering. Just interested in your latest thoughts there. Richard Galanti : Well, I think the biggest thing continues to be we're better when study does sign up that they sign up in those countries where we offer executive membership, which is, I'm guessing, 85% of our company, more, maybe 90% of our company. It's just not in some of the smaller unit countries. And overall -- starting with the U.S., but overall in Canada, we do a better job of getting you to sign up as an executive member to start with. We also do a better job of getting you to sign up to auto renew with putting in your credit card. All those things help -- let's face it, all those things help, too. We know that an executive member buys more and shops more frequently in a year than a non-store member. We know that one of those members with a credit card, co-brand credit card shops even more frequently and spends more. And they do all 3, they're an executive member with a card versus being a regular member, that's the big kahuna here. And so I think that we've seen those trends go on over the last few years, frankly. And what's helped in the last year is the fact that, again, just our new member sign-ups has been higher than they had been historically over the last few years versus the last year -- last year or two. And I think we believe that's more because of COVID, and we were in a good place to shop. Peter Benedict : Sure. That makes sense. And as my last question, just an interest and -- interest income and other, obviously, has a few components to it. I'm curious if you can help us understand what the interest income was in the quarter. I think it was about $8 million last year. I'm sure that was up a lot this quarter. Just curious if you could give us a sense of what that number was in the first quarter? Richard Galanti : Is that in the Q? Okay. Yes, I can give it to you. Hold on a second. I didn't realize it's in the Q, which is not out yet. But what it is, is you've got a big increase in interest income and a big increase in FX downside. So of the 50 -- I think it was 53 is -- $54 million is interest income and the negative $1 million is other, which is a chunk of that's FX. And then this year, the $42 million -- I'm sorry, last year, it was $8 million of interest income and $34 million of other, the biggest piece of other being FX. So that added up to the $42 million. This year, the $53 million is $54 million of interest income and minus 1 of other. Operator : And we'll go next now to Kelly Bania of BMO. Kelly Bania : Richard, I just had one on elasticity and then another follow-up on the big ticket. But in terms of elasticity, any changes -- I'm not sure how you measure it or monitor it, but any changes in your members' response to your actions when you are taking some lower prices here? Richard Galanti : I think if you asked the buyers overall that there's a little less elasticity than there used to be on some of the things. Again, now that answer comes from the fact that my comments about big-ticket discretionary items. We've put more money behind it and that successfully cleaned up our inventory where we were over in some areas like furniture to some extent. But at the end of the day, I think in a year or two ago, we would have even guessed that could have been a little stronger. But then that gets back to the whole question is the economy -- the concerns in the economy impacting big-ticket discretionary items. So yes, I mean, there's clearly still elasticity. When we do temporary price discounts or even our MVM mailers, we still get good impact from it. Some things, the bigger the ticket, not as much as we used to get. Kelly Bania : That's helpful. And then just a follow-up again on the big ticket. What percent of your sales would you say are big ticket, maybe it ebbs and flows with the seasons, but just in general? And do you see that members are pretty broad-based in pulling back meaning across income levels, Executive, Gold Star, et cetera? Richard Galanti : Well, online, it's a little over 40. But online is only 9% of our sales. In store, I don't have it in front of me. 10 would be a good guess. And including that 10, furniture as well. So big -- and jewelry, big-ticket discretionary. Operator : And we'll go next now to Chris Horvers at JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : So following up a little bit there. On the TV side, is it -- how much of it is a units down issue versus deflation? And is there any differentiation that you're seeing between larger and smaller screen size purchases? Richard Galanti : Yes. Units are actually up. And there's normal deflation in TV electronics anyway. And -- but there is perhaps a little bit of smaller sizes are coming down a little bit. Not everyone wants an 85-inch television but -- which is where we over-index to bigger ticket stuff to start with. But we are seeing actual unit sales up. Christopher Horvers : So units are up with strength -- relative strength in smaller sizes? Richard Galanti : Yes. Yes. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And then a couple of sort of other bigger picture consumer questions. I guess, is there -- are you seeing maybe some mid- to low end, maybe not buying the 18 pack of Bounty? Like do you think you might be losing some category share as someone's trying to economize the ticket for your -- the lower half of your income perspective? And then can you also -- can you also talk about regionality? Obviously, there's some weakness in certain housing markets in certain cities, and then there's -- you have a big exposure to California. There's been more layoff news in the technology industry, and there's some population migration. So what are you seeing from a regionality perspective where you're seeing more weakness versus strength? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, we're seeing strength in sundries as part of what we call food and sundries, which is everything. Food and food and sundries is everything from canned beverages to crackers and cereal, and sundries, of course, paper goods and cleaning supplies and the like. And we're seeing strength in those areas. Those are -- those are actually strong, offset by some of the weakness I talked about on the non-food side. As it relates to regional, I don't -- we don't really see any big differences. I mean every month, you're going to see a region stronger or weaker. It has more to do in our view right now of late with weather than anything else. I can't give you anything definitive on what's -- is the region -- it's pretty -- they're all pretty close. Bob Nelson : Within 1.5 points or 2 points. Richard Galanti : Bob is saying here, they're within a couple of points of comp. Christopher Horvers : Got it. And then one cleanup question. Just on the inventory, you talked about pockets. It sounded like you cleaned up furniture and electronics, it sounds like. Is there any -- where are those pockets? How much is maybe holiday, decor or toys, other more at-risk categories in the month of December? Richard Galanti : The good news is our merchants are sitting here, holiday decor is fine. One example actually would be we have a small amount of air conditioners and fans, which was -- it was a hot summer, and we were very strong in it. There were delays some of the supply chain challenges, some of that stuff didn't come in until September. And needless to say, we're not going to put it out there and mark it down when nobody really is looking for an air conditioner unit in September. And so that's the example of a few things now. We still have some furniture. It's way down from where it had been. So very, very manageable. I think beyond that, there's nothing huge. And again, the big question right now would be the fact that from a standpoint of Christmas stuff, both the Christmas stuff as well as toys, we're in pretty good shape for that. We feel pretty good about that. Operator : We go next now to Scot Ciccarelli at Truist. Scot Ciccarelli : I guess I have another gross margin question. And I guess it's -- look, if consumables continue to outpace discretionary goods based on what we're seeing in the economy, should we expect gross margins to compress a bit just from mix? Or do you have enough levers given existing price gaps across most of your categories to match the flattish gross margins? Just how should we think about the mix impact? Richard Galanti : We'll let you know next quarter. I mean we have a lot of levers, as you've mentioned, as you suggested, to pull and push. We're also aggressive on pricing when we want to be like in the fresh foods area that I just mentioned. And we're blessed right now with -- in some categories like gas that is a better margin. So all that stuff, again, there's a variety of puts and takes. We feel overall, there's nothing unusual about this quarter. And frankly, if inflation is not rising again, even if it doesn't go down, but it doesn't rise again from its current levels, we're in pretty good stead of greatly improving the component of margin that relates to a LIFO charge, particularly in Q3 and 4 when we had a $100-plus million number and a $200-plus million number. But that's to be seen, and we need to wait and see. Scot Ciccarelli : So just as a follow-up on that, Richard, like fair to say that we're going to see lower freight rates starting to flow through the P&L and let's call it, less markdown pressure because the inventories are cleaned up a bit more than the last few quarters? Richard Galanti : That should help you a little bit. Sure. But as you might expect and one of the reasons we took this charge is we don't want to have to have the buyers worry about inputting higher costs into their -- if rates have come down and we contracted, we want to take some of that out. But that's still being worked through. That's not -- we have to continue to do that. Beyond that, as rates come down, you'll see our prices on items come down, too. Okay. Why don't we take two more questions? Operator : Certainly, Richard. Thank you. We'll go next now to Karen Short at Credit Suisse. Karen Short : Hope you all have happy holidays coming forward -- going forward. But I did want to clarify on two things. So in the past, when you have had slightly weakening traffic trends that has generally been a point to consider to actually push through higher membership rate increase. So I'm wondering, I know this is a very unusual time, but has that philosophy changed at all? Because obviously, your comps are changing or in -- or slowing? And then I would ask the same thing as it relates to the special dividend. We all know what your cash is and available cash is on the balance sheet in terms of timing with respect to announcing something like that along the lines of the fact that I think your Board meeting is mid-January? Richard Galanti : We have one every quarter. Look, we talked about both of those. In terms of the fee increase, I think over the last many years, we've probably done them at a time when things were particularly strong comp wise. The good news is during all times, renewal rates were strong and have gotten even stronger. We always look at ourselves in the mirror and feel that the value proposition has gotten better. That being said, we have done them -- I remember one time we were asked, it may have been back in '09, '10, during the Great Recession because I guess we did one probably in '11 or '12, which continued the Great Recession. And we'd be asked given the Great Recession, would you hold off on it? And our view was -- and comps were a little weaker back then, too, for at least a couple of quarters. And I think the comment I made was something to the effect, we'd probably do it anyway because we're going to use it to drive greater value in terms of pricing and everything in a big way. And so that really -- I think we've probably done it in times of lower comps or higher comps or good economy or tougher economy.  And I think with the headline in the -- I probably mentioned in the last quarter call or even the quarter before that, with the headline being recession question mark and inflation exclamation point, there's no rush. And first of all, even if we follow the pattern of the last three -- over the last 16 or so years, they averaged 5 years and 7 months. And I know now that 5 years and 7 months from June of '17 is January of '23. I know on the last call, I said, that doesn't mean it's going to be January '23. It will be -- it's a question of when, not if. But at this juncture, we'll just have to wait and see. And I'm not trying to be cute about it, but there's not a whole lot more I can tell you. There's no analytical framework we use other than we feel very good about our member loyalty and our strength. And if we wanted to do it yesterday, we could. If we want to do it six months from now, we can. So we'll wait and see. As it relates to the special dividend, as you know, we've said before, it's certainly an arrow in our quiver that has boded well for us, we believe. We think that's done well. We've done 4 of them. The last one was a couple of years ago, and we certainly do have cash. Mind you, when you look at our cash, about half of it's U.S. and not cash equivalents. And so certainly, we have the ability to do it at some point. I think we wanted to wait and see how things are continuing here. I think that, too, is probably a question of when, not if. But again, you'll be the second to know, after us. Operator : And we'll take our final question this evening from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America. Robert Ohmes : It will be a real quick one, Richard. Can you just remind us, you're back to 15 net stores in the U.S., but what has to happen to go back to kind of the years where you would open kind of a net 25 a year in the U.S. and maybe relieve some of the pressure on the over-productive clubs in the U.S. right now? Richard Galanti : Yes. I think it's been a few years. I mean when we opened the net of 27 or 28, maybe low 20s or 22 or 23 were there. But we've been at maybe 16 or 17 out of 23-ish in the last few years. If you ask Craig, who's not in the room, but if you ask him, if we're opening a net of 24 this year, I think I said, what's the goal five and 10 years from now, probably to get it closer to 30 net. And probably by 5 years from now, it's 50-50 U.S. elsewhere -- versus elsewhere. That's the same answer I, by the way, said 5 years ago in terms of the split. But we'd like to see add 5 to that 24 in the next few years to go up a little bit higher. Certainly we have a lot of activity going on. Richard Galanti : Okay. With that, everyone, I'll thank you. Have a good holiday, and we're around to answer questions. Operator : Thank you, Richard. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude Costco's fiscal Q1 2023 Conference Call. Thank you all so much for joining us. I wish you all a great evening. Goodbye. Richard Galanti : Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day. My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco Wholesale Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference call. [Operator Instructions] Richard Galanti, CFO, you may begin your conference. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Emma, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are being made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal '23, the 12 weeks ended this past February 12, as well as February retail sales for the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 26. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $1.466 billion or $3.30 per share compared to $1.299 billion or $2.92 per diluted share last year, an increase of 13%. In terms of sales, net sales for the second quarter increased 6.5% to $54.24 billion compared to $50.94 billion reported a year ago in the second quarter. Our comparable sales for the second quarter were as follows : in the U.S., 5.7% for the 12-week period, excluding gas inflation, 5.8%; Canada, 3.5% reported and 9.6% excluding gas inflation and FX; Other International, 3.8% reported and 9.5% ex gas inflation and FX; for Total Company, 5.2% reported and 6.8% excluding gas inflation and FX; e-commerce was minus 9.6% for the 12 weeks reported and minus 8.7% excluding FX. In terms of second quarter comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 5% worldwide and 3.7% in the United States. Our average transaction or ticket was up 0.2% worldwide and up 1.9% in the U.S. during Q2. Foreign currencies relative to the dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.8%, and gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales very slightly by approximately 0.2%. I'll review our February sales results later in the call. Next on the income statement is membership fee income. Reported in the second quarter, $1.027 billion of membership fee income or 1.89%. That's for this year's second quarter compared to $967 million a year earlier, so a $60 million increase in dollars or up 6.2%. Excluding the headwinds in FX, the $60 million increase would have been higher by additional $20 million. So on an FX-adjusted basis, membership fee income was up just over 8 percentage points. In terms of renewal rates, at second quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 92.6%, up 0.01% from Q1 end, and worldwide rate came in at 90.5%, also up 0.01% from the prior quarter, both represent all-time highs. Membership growth has remained strong. We ended the second quarter with 68.1 million paid household members and 123.0 million cardholders, both up more than 7% versus a year earlier. At Q2 end, we had 30.6 million paid executive memberships. This is an increase during the 12-week quarter of 630,000 members since Q1 end. Executive members now represent 45% of paid members and about 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement, next is our gross margin. On a reported basis, gross margin was higher year-over-year by 8 basis points, coming in at 10.72% as a percent of sales as compared to a year earlier second quarter at 10.64%. Now the 8 basis points up, and then excluding gas inflation, have been up 9 basis points. As I always ask you to draw a little chart with 2 columns, reported and excluding gas inflation, and then we'll go down the line items. Core merchandise was minus 6 basis points reported and also minus 6 ex gas inflation. Ancillary businesses were plus 2 and plus 3 basis points year-over-year; 2% reward, minus 2 and minus 2 basis points. LIFO, since we had a charge last year and nothing this fiscal quarter, it was plus 14 and plus 14. For total, again, reported, 8 basis points up year-over-year; and ex gas inflation, up 9 basis points. Starting with the core. Our core merchandise gross margin again was lower by 6 basis points year-over-year. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margin, if you will, it was lower year-over-year by 26 basis points. Most major departments in general were down, with fresh foods being down a little more than others. We're continuing to hold or drop prices where we can to drive traffic and improve our competitive advantage. Overall, core sales benefited from sales shifting from ancillary and other businesses to core. Ancillary and other businesses gross margins again were higher by 2 and 3 basis points ex gas in the quarter. Gas business centers and travel were better year-over-year, offset in part by e-com and pharmacy. 2% Reward lower by 2 basis points, that's reflective of the higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO, as I mentioned, was a year-over-year variance of plus 14 basis points. We had no LIFO charge this fiscal quarter compared to a $71 million charge in Q2 last year. Moving on to expenses, SG&A. Our reported SG&A for the second quarter was higher year-over-year by 13 basis points. This year, it was 9.11% compared to 8.98% in the second quarter of last fiscal year. Jotting down some numbers for the 2 columns, first column being reported; the second, ex gas inflation. Operations was down -- higher, I said, minus 2 basis points -- higher by 2 basis points, so minus 2 and minus 2; central, minus 9 and minus 9, so higher year-over-year in central by 9 basis points; stock compensation, minus 2 and minus 2; and then all told, that would be 13 basis points higher, both on a reported basis and ex gas inflation. The core operations component of SG&A, again, higher by 2 basis points and also higher by 2 ex inflation. This includes the wage and benefits increases implemented last March and last year's third fiscal quarter and an additional top-of-scale wage increase that went into effect July 4, which was in our fourth quarter of last year. Central, as I mentioned, was higher by 9 basis points year-over-year. About half of this increase is a charge related to a tax audit covering several prior years. Stock comp pretty much as expected, just a couple of basis points. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $34 million this year, $2 million lower than the $36 million figure in Q2 of last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $89 million year-over-year. This was driven by an increase in interest income due to both higher interest rates being earned and on higher cash balances. The increase in interest income was slightly offset by unfavorable FX. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the second quarter was 26.1%, down slightly from the 26.7% figure in Q2 last year. The effective rate for the year, excluding discrete items, continues to be projected in the 26% to 27% range. Overall, net income was up about 13%. In terms of a few other items of note, warehouse expansion. In the second quarter, we opened 3 net new warehouses, 2 in the U.S. and 1 in Australia. Additionally, next week, we'll open our third warehouse in China, with our fourth and fifth China new openings scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, so a total of 3 this fiscal year in China. In fiscal '23, we expect to open a total of 27 warehouses, including 3 relocations, so a net increase of 24 new warehouses. These 24 planned new openings are made up of 14 in the U.S. and 10 in Other International. The 10 in Other International includes the 3 in China, along with our first Costcos in each of New Zealand and Sweden, both of which were opened during the fiscal first quarter. Regarding capital expenditures, our second quarter fiscal '23 capital spend was approximately $900 million. Our estimate for the year remains in the range of $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion based on timing. In terms of e-commerce, as I mentioned, e-commerce sales in Q2, ex FX decreased 8.7%. This weakness was driven mostly by our online mix of sales. Big-ticket discretionary departments like majors, home furnishings, small electrics, jewelry, hardware, these were down 15% in the quarter and make up 58% of our e-com sales. These same departments, by the way, were down 11% in warehouse but only make up 8% of total warehouse in-line sales. Now a few comments regarding inflation. It continues to seem to improve somewhat. Recall, back in the fourth fiscal quarter, which ended last August, our estimated year-over-year price inflation was 8% for that prior fiscal year. During Q1, the estimate on a year-over-year basis came down to 6% to 7%. In Q2, we estimate that the equivalent year-over-year inflation number has come down to 5% to 6% range and even a little lower than that towards the end of the quarter, according to the buyers. We continue to see some improvements in many items. Commodity prices are starting to fall not back to pre-COVID levels and some examples but continue to provide some relief with things like chicken, bacon, butter, steel, resin, nuts. Switching over to our inventory levels. Again, both in Q3 and Q4 fiscal year-ends in fiscal '22, on a year-over-year basis, our inventories were up 26% year-over-year. And then in our first quarter of this year, they were up 10%, so good improvement there. As of this quarter end, our inventory year-over-year as of the end of Q2 was down 2% year-over-year. Regarding the 2% drop, we were a bit over-inventoried last year as a result of supply chain challenges, causing inventory to be backed up at the ports. And talking to the buyers a year ago, their estimate of just timing of getting things across the ocean was 70-plus days. Today, it's back down to 30-ish days. And so supply chain improvement across the board and rates, of course, coming down. Now turning now to our February sales, the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 26. As reported in our release, net sales for the month were $17.06 billion, an increase of 4.7% from $16.29 billion a year earlier in the month of February. Recall from January sales results that the Lunar New Year, Chinese New Year occurred on January 22 this year, 10 days earlier this year. The shift positively impacted February's Other International by about 2% and Total Company by about 0.25%. Additionally, February's results for both the U.S. and Total Company were negatively impacted by approximately 1%, we estimate, as a result of substantially worse weather this year over year. I believe most of that was on the traffic side rather than ticket side. Same-store sales, again in the release, on the U.S., as reported, 3.4%; ex gas, 3.5%; Canada reported, 1.2; ex gas and FX, 7.3%; Other International, 6.5% reported; ex gas and FX, plus 11.5%; Total Company, 3.5% reported; ex-gas and FX was 5.0%; in terms of e-com, minus 11.2% reported compared to a minus 10.3% without FX. That's actually an improvement from our January e-com results. Our comp traffic or frequency in February was up 4.9% worldwide and 3.1% in the U.S. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar negatively impacted total and comparable sales as follows : Canada, been impacted by 5.5 percentage points, Other International by approximately 5.7% and Total Company by approximately 1.5%. Gasoline prices were essentially flat year-over-year, ever so slightly inflationary, but essentially flat. Worldwide, the average transaction for February was down 1.3%, including the negative impact from FX that I just mentioned. In terms of regional and merchandising categories, general highlights for February that we normally do in this monthly sales call. The U.S. regions with the strongest comp sales were the Midwest, the Northeast and the Southeast. In terms of Other International, in local currencies, we saw the strongest results in Spain, U.K. and Mexico. Year-over-year inflation for food and sundries and fresh foods, while still elevated, were at their lowest levels in nearly a year, with food and sundries inflation dropping to the high single digits and fresh foods to the low to mid-single digits. Moving to merchandise highlights. The following comparable sales results by category for the month excludes the negative impact from foreign exchange. Food and sundries were positive low double digits. Cooler, food and sundries were the strongest. Fresh foods were up mid-single digits. Better-performing departments included bakery and meat. Non-foods were negative mid-single digits. Better-performing departments included tires, health and beauty aids and apparel. Majors, which were electronics and big-ticket electronics items, jewelry, housewares, domestics and small appliances and hardware were the worse performers, consistent with Q2 overall. Ancillary businesses sales were up mid-single digits. Food court, hearing aid and pharmacy were the top performers there. Finally, in terms of upcoming earnings and sales releases, we will announce our March sales results for the 5 weeks ending Sunday, April 2, on the following Wednesday, April 5, after market close. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back over to Emma for questions and answers. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : I guess, sizing up the consumer, I want to see how you view February in, I guess, the continuum of months. And then part of it, I think you said down mid-teens with some of those e-commerce categories. Thanks for that information. Is that stable? Is that worse? How do you kind of diagnose the whole consumer in the business? Richard Galanti : Well, I think as we talked about even the last 12 weeks ago, in the quarterly numbers, we've seen some weakness in what I'll call big-ticket discretionary items. I'm not an economist, but I think it's a combination of the economy and concerns out there as well as particularly strong numbers that we enjoyed not only a year ago but a year prior to that with COVID that we, of course, benefited in big ways with those big-ticket items. So all those things, I think, reflect that in those numbers. There's just a couple of weeks in a couple of regions where we started to set out some seasonal things for spring and summer. So far, so good, but it's literally small data points in small parts of the country where the weather has been a little better, which is not a lot of places. But anecdotally, some comments were made on things like even some water sports items and camping equipment. But it's a small data set. So we'll cross our fingers and hope to see. But overall, units are generally fine. I mean there's some things still with like, on the computer side, there's weakness overall, not just with us. I think I mentioned this on the first quarter call, we're seeing decent sales in units of televisions while the average selling price points have come down. I think it's just in the next couple of weeks where the new TVs for the upcoming season are coming out. But other than that, what we look at, of course, our average transactions or shopping frequency is up. Our new sign-ups are continuing to be strong, up 7% in terms of new sign-ups on less than 3% new openings. So those things bode well, but people certainly are spending their dollars where they feel they should be spending them. And so we'll see where it goes from here. Simeon Gutman : Okay. A follow-up on EBIT growth, I know you don't guide, but this business has averaged, I think, about high single or maybe around 10% over time. This year, it's a little below average because of some of the lapping and you are lapping some great fuel gross profit. Curious of the puts and the takes. So whatever number that you expect the EBIT dollars of this business to grow, are you confident in the levers that you have to get there? Richard Galanti : Well, look, we feel good about what we're doing in driving business in the right way and growing our business. As you and others have heard forever, we're a top line company. While I can't give guidance, certainly, we and everybody who has cash benefit from earning more money on their cash right now. As we saw in this quarter, there was a $70 million improvement in year-over-year comparison of gross margin simply because of LIFO. We can't predict what's going to happen, at least the trends yesterday were that we're starting to see some improvement in inflation. To the extent that continues, we're comparing to LIFO charges in excess of $100 million and $200 million in each of Q3 and Q4. So that's something that we look at as well. Gas is volatile, no pun intended, and it's been quite profitable in some quarters more than others. But we think that we've got the different levers and puts and takes, if you will, to do that. But ultimately, it's about driving sales. And certainly, we know we're getting the customer in. We're getting more of them in and they're, again, renewing at the highest rate ever. So we'll go through this as good, if not better, than others. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : So Richard, last time there was an economic downturn in the United States and globally, Costco performed pretty well, was able to comp positive during that time. This turnaround, it's a much bigger business, and it might exhibit more economic sensitivity. So a, is that how you're thinking about it? And b, what actions would Costco take to preserve its profitability in the event that it saw negative comps in the coming quarters? Richard Galanti : Well, we're going to do things that drive market share, first and foremost. We are certainly cognizant of the bottom line. And I think this quarter is a good example of that. But at the same token, we're going to do what we need to do to drive sales because long term, when we get our customer in and they buy stuff, they're going to come back and buy more stuff. And we've always done a good job of that. Again, this one is a little different, this economic downturn, with the rising interest rates and the headlines of recession and high interest rates. But that being said, I think we're fortunate in the sense that we've got a multitude, various types of businesses within our business from big ticket discretionary items to food and sundries and health and beauty aids and fresh foods, which is really driving the cart right now more so than it has in the past. So we'll continue to do what we do. I remember years ago, someone asked about if sales were slowing down, what would we do. And we said we'd drive more sales by being even hotter on prices. But generally, that's worked for us, and I see that equation continuing. Michael Lasser : And a follow-up question is, to your point, the inflationary number that you cited are lower than what others are experiencing. So presumably, your price gaps are widening, which makes sense and you're delivering more value for your member at a time where they arguably need it. And with that being said, how does the fact that you are delivering more value to your consumer and then maybe somewhat pressured play into your mindset around whether or not you would raise your fess? I believe this spring would be the 5-year anniversary of the last time you raised your fees and you typically do it around this time. Richard Galanti : Yes. Actually, June would be our sixth anniversary. As I mentioned in the previous calls, looking at the last, I think, 3, they averaged around 5 years and 7 months, which is about now or last month. And what we said over the last few quarters is that, in our view, it's a question of when, not if. And so we'll let you know. But keep in mind, that's one way that we become even more competitive. We take those monies and directly become even more competitive. I might add though, our locations do weekly comp shops of 100 to 150 key items, all directly competitive items, and then a variety of other against our direct competitors and other limited comp shops against other forms of traditional retail where the gap of competitiveness is much greater. But at the end of the day, our relative level of competitiveness, in our view, is as strong as it's ever been. And we do that weekly in locations. And every 4-week, monthly 2-day budget meeting, each of the regional operations' senior executives get up and show those numbers. And you can rest assure we're going to continue to do that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : So following up on the first question, I guess, relative to the last time that you spoke to us, do you think the consumers deteriorated at all? Anything that you're seeing on what they're buying, how price sensitive, private label, income demographic? What are your observations around the rate of change for the consumer? Richard Galanti : Not terribly different than a quarter ago or probably in David's January sales recording. So again, it all centers around big-ticket discretionary. And we look at that and we look at how it compared to a year ago and then 2 years ago. We had so much strength there not only with COVID and people buying big-ticket stuff, now the economy and the interest rates, so that's to be expected. Again, we kind of go phew, our strength in food and sundries and fresh foods and health and beauty aids and things like that help to counter some of that. One interesting comment that I think I haven't made in the past, we've been asked that during this concern about inflation and people trading down, have we seen any delta in the sales penetration of our own Kirkland Signature items. And of course, my first comment is that's a trade up or a trade equal, not a trade down. But at the end of the day, we have seen actually, in the last few months, a bigger delta than normal. I'd say over the last 10 years, we see 0.5% or a little less than 0.5% a year of increased penetration. For this quarter year-over-year, we're seen a little over 1.5 percentage point increase in sales penetration on the food side, foods being anything packaged or dry or wet, you name it. And so we have seen a little bit of an increase in that. I guess that's consistent with the concession that most people are looking to save money. And of course, if it's our brand, that's great. That creates loyalty. Christopher Horvers : Yes. And then on the pricing/LIFO point, last quarter, you talked about like we could have a LIFO benefit and that could be a source of funds in terms of investing in price. So a two-part question, if prices stayed here today, would we essentially get back the LIFO headwinds that you had a year ago as we think about going forward? And then the second question is, you mentioned your price gaps are as good as they've ever been but, at the same time, there was some change in consumer. So should we think about that LIFO as a source of funds to further invest in price? Richard Galanti : I was looking at it more not as a source of funds but more as -- look, to the extent that, and this is just using this as an example, if there was no LIFO charge plus or minus in Q3 and Q4, on a year-over-year comparison, you have, on a pretax basis, $130 million positive delta and a $223 million positive delta. Those are nice numbers to have a positive delta. So from a standpoint of looking at the earlier question about are we cognizant of earnings growth, if you will, or reported earnings per share, part of that plays into that, that gives us a little bit of cushion there as does gasoline from time to time, as does, first and foremost, stronger sales. So all those things play into that. I think generally speaking, we're still going to do what's right, in our view, to drive sales. That's what we want to do, first and foremost. And to the extent that, that example occur in Q3 and Q4, that gives us a little room to do that without even thinking about it. Christopher Horvers : And then just from the accounting perspective, should we automatically get that back if prices stay at these levels on the lap? Richard Galanti : If the lapping stays at 0, yes, there would be no new charge, so it would be comparing to a charge last year. To the extent that, yes, prices were to go down relative to a year ago, you'd actually have a LIFO credit, which would be even a bigger year-over-year delta. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Charles Grom : Richard, just curious if you could talk about the gas business from a competitive standpoint and how that's changed bigger picture over the years and then, more recently, how gas balance have trended. Richard Galanti : Yes. Gas has been a relative blessing as well. It's a profitable business. It is volatilely profitable. Sometimes it's more. And sometimes, it's less. But overall, it's a profitable business. It's given us an additional competitive advantage of getting people in the door, if you will. I think it was this last summer into early fall where I've given some numbers where our gallon sales increases in the U.S. were up in the mid- to high teens compared to darn near flat for the U.S. population as a whole. I announced yesterday on that, and I think that 15-plus percent delta of us versus the U.S. population is still about 10 percentage points. And so we are still taking market share, if you will, and getting people in the parking lot. And in terms of value, we look at a value compared to average value across our locations where we do comp shops, in some cases, every day in many locations. This year, to date, I'm looking at single-digit number, we feel that we saved a member $0.37. That's an improvement. Over the last 5 years, it's gone from the mid-20s to the mid-30s. Charles Grom : Okay. That's helpful context. And then just on the inflation, just as prices have started to come down and as you've invested in price, too, curious what you've seen from a demand perspective and how you're measuring the success of some of those price actions that you appear to be taking? Richard Galanti : Well, it's an art, not a science. We'll look at high-velocity items where we can make a big difference, pass on some items. On some things, I mean this is just anecdotal because it was from our last budget meeting, with shipping costs coming dramatically down, on a 25- and 50-pound bags of jasmine rice, we've seen a big uptick in sales because that's an item that really skyrocketed because it's per pound, based on the size of the bag, it was a heavy freight cost. And so as that comes down, we see that going. I think we're doing more with our suppliers, changing things around with the MVM. Part of that's based on allocation issues of what we have. But overall, no, we're firm believer of if you improve the value by lowering the price, you're going to drive more sales. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Scot Ciccarelli : So you guys, like many others, have seen a shift away from a bunch of discretionary categories, probably stronger sales strength in the consumable category. But gross margins are actually pretty stable. So I guess the question is, should we start to expect more gross margin pressure on a go-forward basis if we were to kind of see that mix shift continue to lean towards kind of food and consumables? Richard Galanti : Frankly, the delta between those various categories are not as extreme as they used to be. And in fact, in things like fresh foods and food and sundries, some of the weaker categories -- not weaker, but lower-margin categories -- are things like big-ticket discretionary items. We make a smaller percentage, more dollars per unit, of course, but a smaller percentage on big-ticket electronics. And so that impacts more the gross margin dollars than the percentages there. If anything, if you go do a little homework on what the cost of processing and selling a rotisserie chicken, our $4.99 price, which we maintain, is an investment in low prices to drive membership, to drive the sales in a big way. So there are some things that we do, notwithstanding huge inflation. And even though some of the costs have come down a little bit, relatively speaking, we want those wow items in there as well. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. And then one follow-up here, you guys have obviously done a couple of onetime dividends over the years, but that was always in a really low interest rate environment. And as you guys just reported with your net interest income, you can actually generate some real returns on your cash now. So I guess the question is, does the higher risk-free interest rate environment actually discourage you from returning that capital through future dividends? Richard Galanti : Well, it helps a little right now. So that's good news. I don't think it changes our view that the special dividend, which we've done over the last 10.5 years, I think, it's still an arrow in our quiver. And at some point, it's something you might see again. But I'm not trying to be cute, it's kind of like the membership question, we'll let you know when we do it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse. Karen Short : So Richard, you made a comment that you're particularly cognizant of the bottom line. I think it was your exact commentary. So I'm wondering if you can triangulate that with what you think net or pretax margin numbers should look like on a go-forward basis but also triangulate that with the fact that you also commented that you're looking to invest in price to gain share in various categories. Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, I think on the latter comment, we're looking to use price to gain share, we're continuing to do that. It's not like we're going to go do more or less. I mean that's what we do for a living. What I was trying to say in the comment, that being we're particularly cognizant to the bottom line, we are a public for-profit company, and our shareholders want to know what we're doing. There have been times, for those of you that have followed us for many years, when we might take a bigger hit on some expense in a given quarter. I think, in fact, many years ago, it was the rotisserie chicken example that we, frankly, I think, have more levers today to adjust things, which helps us. But we're not going to get away from those 2 things, driving the top line and being cognizant that we're also a public company trying to earn money for our shareholders. But we're going to prioritize driving sales because that will benefit all the other things on the income statement. Karen Short : Okay. And then just on inventory, just obviously, inventory down meaningfully, but any thoughts on how to think about inventory going forward relative to sales given that it was down 2.5%? And I'm not sure how much of that was gas or fuel related, so maybe if you can parse out that relative to ex fuel commentary. Richard Galanti : Yes. By the way, gasoline inventory is very small relative to everything else. And it turns darn near daily. But a lot of the improvement or reduction in inventory year-over-year was all the stuff backed up with the supply chain challenges and the port challenges a year ago. So we feel we're in good inventory shape. The flow is much better. There's always going to be anecdotal examples of stuff, we have a little too much of something or a little too less, but we feel pretty good right now about our inventory levels even by category. There's a few categories, a little over a few categories under, but nothing like when we were 26% up and had a lot of, what I'll call, in-transit stuff literally on those pictures that you saw on the news, of the ports, on the ships. And so that's improved a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Thomas Nass : It's Tom on for Oliver. On digital, can you guys add some color as to how comps are expected to trend in the near term just given the easing compares in the back half of the year? And additionally, what opportunities lie ahead in terms of digital business from an engagement point of view? Richard Galanti : Well, we don't project where we're going. But I was glad at least that February, while negative, was a little better than January. We've got additional marketing activities that we've got going on there. We did hire just 5 months ago a new Head of Digital that is in the process of doing a lot of things. So there'll be more to report over the next several quarters. In my view, there's a lot of opportunities and low hanging fruit to do that. The biggest thing, the challenge that we've had, just looking at our current numbers, was that we've been so successful over the last 2 years. Not only did COVID drive huge business on big-ticket things for home, be it furniture, electronics, televisions, you name it, computers, and also the acquisition a couple of years ago or 3 years ago of what's now called Costco Logistics, those 2 things drove that business in such a big way. We recognize that's part of it. But we're not hanging our hat on that, we want to grow the sales. Thomas Nass : Great. And as a follow-up on the executive memberships, with the higher penetration there, could you just talk about how those members behave relatively, and additionally, the effects on the business from that higher penetration? Richard Galanti : Well, they're more loyal, they spend more and they come more frequently. It's only good stuff. So look, at the end of the day, if we can get somebody to, in the U.S. as an example, spend $120 instead of $60 at the current rates, and with that, they get the 2% Reward with some other benefits on certain consequential transactions, that definitely drives loyalty and drive frequency. And so the executive member spends more and shops more. And then if we get them also to get the co-branded Citi Visa card, it's even better than that. So all those things work, in our view, in a positive direction. And so we like the fact that the executive membership penetration helped. We've said in the last couple of years, we brought it into a few other smaller countries. You need a core base of 15 or so locations to do it. And so we've provided it in other locations as well. But we're still seeing increased penetration in the U.S. of that. We do a better job, by the way, when somebody new comes in to sign up, getting them to sign up, we do a better job of explaining the benefits of an executive membership than we did years ago as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO. Kelly Bania : I'm going to venture to ask a margin question here. The core-on-core has been down for about 8 quarters in a row, I believe. I was just wondering if you could help us understand the thought process in managing the core margin in that way? And I guess, particularly given your comment that some of the low-margin categories like big ticket are under a little bit more pressure, so maybe even a little bit more surprising, is it just the way that other mix is shaking out? Is this intentionally? Are you reinvesting any of the maybe gas windfall that we've had over the past several quarters? Are you investing that back into the store? Maybe just help us understand the thought process in this core-on-core decline here. Richard Galanti : Yes. I think the biggest component of the answer to that question is our fresh margins have been the biggest piece of that coming down. And looking at it, our fresh margin in Q2 compared to Q2 3 years ago, pre-COVID, we're still up about 50, 60 basis points. Now we were up a lot more than that because of all the things that COVID did. It drove tremendous sales growth in those areas, which created less spoilage, which is a proponent of cost of sales in fresh foods, and labor productivity in places like the bakery and the meat department. And so it was, if you will, outsized improvement. We're still better than we were pre-COVID. And we've maintained the sales. These are not real numbers, I don't have them in front of me, but let's make them up and say that fresh pre-COVID was going up 8% or 10% a year, 8% a year or whatever it was, and then we enjoyed a couple of years of 20-plus percent, I believe. And now we're still doing fine with sales growth, not up to 8% or 10%, but nonetheless, it's still a positive. And so we've kept all those outsized gains. But we've also, of late, not just the last month or 2 but over the last several months, have invested in pricing. And certainly, fresh helps drive that. And I gave the example of the rotisserie chicken, but that goes through lots of areas of fresh foods where that's one of the key categories that people come in to shop for. Kelly Bania : And are you thinking of managing that in a way to get back to kind of pre-COVID levels? Or would you let that run a little above for some period of time? Richard Galanti : I don't think we're smart enough to know how to manage all these things. There's so many different components of what is the gross margin from the different core departments to the ancillary businesses, to gas, to LIFO now. So it really is fluid. And we do manage it, but it's managing it in an organized, chaotic way sometimes, too, as things change every day. I think we do a great job of doing it. Kelly Bania : No, agreed. Agreed. Just, I guess, following up on the LIFO as it relates to the margin, you gave out some of the numbers in terms of the dollars in the last couple of quarters. In order of magnitude, would those kind of offset some of the gas margin tailwinds? Is that the way to think about it? Or would the GAAP margin tailwind be bigger or smaller than those LIFO charges? Richard Galanti : Sometimes, in a given month even, it can be bigger or smaller, honestly. I mean gas fluctuates quite a bit. But good try on asking. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore. Gregory Melich : A couple of questions. One, I hate to go back to the membership fee, but it just seems right. The $120 executive price point, now that that's, what, 43% of members and 70-some percent of sales, does the fact that that's where the bulk of the sales are coming from change the thought process in terms of how you might do the timing of the membership? Richard Galanti : No. Not at all. Gregory Melich : Not at all. Great. And then second is on items in basket, trying to figure out how as comps slow, and I imagine you're still getting that wage inflation, SG&A doesn't delever more, why is that? If traffic's still growing and we have inflation, is it just because items per basket are down? Or how do we think about managing the SG&A dollar growth in this not deflationary but disinflationary environment? Richard Galanti : Yes, units are still up. And frankly, price inflation offsets it a little bit, it helps offset it a little bit, and I think the focus on trying to keep figuring out how to do things more efficiently. One of the things that, again, that we do religiously every 4 weeks at the budget meeting is the operators are talking about certain focus items, whether it's improving overtime hours or things we've done to automate something, physically improve the flow of goods in a warehouse. We've done a pretty good job of that. And we've done that notwithstanding to off-season wage increases this year, 3 off-season wage increases, if you go back, I think, over the last 15 months. So our leverage there and a very slight deleverage is pretty impressive given that labor benefits is our single biggest expense category. So it's productivity. And I think we've continued to do a good job with that. Gregory Melich : And just so I'm getting the math right on the comp, if the comp is running 6 and inflation is running 6, but traffic is up 3, then items in basket would be down 3? Richard Galanti : It's mix. Yes, it's mix. Gregory Melich : It's 100% ASP. Got it. All right. That great. Good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. John Heinbockel : Richard, I want to start with I know you guys have begun doing a lot more data analytic work, and you talked about maybe investing in price. Have you done much work on price elasticity by category or item? And you think in the context of non-foods is where there is softness, right, it's not consumables. What can you do mid-course correction there, right, on nonfood? Is there elasticity where you can drive some share early in season by making targeted investments in those categories? Richard Galanti : Well, I think there are, and we do. We don't analyze, frankly, the price elasticity on a historical basis other than we know what works in the past and we keep doing it more. It's pretty straightforward. But we're not doing A/B tests or test let's take this price delta in this region, down x or up only y; in a different region, see which one works better. We're pretty singularly focused on if we lower the price, we'll do more sales. John Heinbockel : All right. And then to follow up on that, right, so again, you think about nonfood, you said maybe nonfood is going to be a little weaker. And it's not all nonfood, right, it's certain categories. Have you dialed back inventory? Do you want to get product -- you get it in early anyway. I'm not sure you can get in any earlier. What do you do, if anything, I guess, inventory would be the biggest thing? Richard Galanti : Well, first and foremost, is being in stock, and to the extent that we bring in a few things early. I think the anecdotal comment I mentioned about water sports and camping, we brought that a little earlier because we had some room. And there's parts of the country, there's no sense bringing in some of that stuff early given the weather right now. But at the end of the day, I think we've always done a pretty good job of that as well. The big thing is working with the suppliers. Using electronics as an example, these are anecdotal stories, but while sales were very strong for 2 years during COVID and supply chain challenges were still there, there was virtually no promotional things. There's now more promotional. Our buyers are out there making sure that we're getting every promotional penny that's out there and being on top of that with our suppliers. That's part of what we do. But that's been more of a focus. Yes, we focus on the categories that are growing. Examples would be like HABA and apparel, which are very strong for us right now. Part of apparel's strength is getting more well-known stuff in. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Brandon Cheatham : This is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. I want to go back to your comments on wider price gaps. It sounds like you're managing the business just kind of how you always have. But your price gaps are wider than they ever have been. So I'm just wondering like how has your competitors' behavior changed? Are there certain categories that they're not responding to? Or are they responding slower than they have in the past? Richard Galanti : Well, I think I said that they're as wide as they've ever been. I don't know if they've gotten wider. But we feel very good about where they are. And this is against direct competitors or other large boxes on certain categories, recognizing when it's a traditional retailer, there's a much bigger price gap to start with. And I'll remind you also, despite the fact that we and another warehouse club essentially sell the same types of items, we want to make sure that on exact like-branded items, we're better priced. So on those $100 million, $150 million, that's where we look at that. They're the most competitive, whether it's Coke and Pepsi or Advil or Tide detergent or key items that everybody knows the price of or is that same item. There are plenty of items that are differing in quantity, quality, size, color, you name it, where we feel that, in some cases, we have a better value. But that's up to the customer to behold that. And so we just keep doing what we're doing. We're focusing on those competitive items and constantly figuring out how to drive more value in any item we do. How do we, especially private label, but how do we upsize the pack while improving the price per unit within the pack? Even when there was big inflation, if there was a 10% increase, inflationary cost increase in something, how do we get the vendor to eat a little of it, will eat a little of it? Needless to say that still the majority of that increase is going to be in the price, but how do we also, beyond that, from a manufacturing standpoint and a packaging standpoint, how do we lower the price by a few extra percentage points by figuring out how to get x percent more cell units on a pallet by changing the configuration of the pack size. We focus more on that than anybody I know because we're taking our $230 billion or $240 billion in sales and dividing it by 3,800 items. So we have many items that are $50 million, $100 million, $300 million, $500 million items. And when we can do that, we think that we do a good job of that. Brandon Cheatham : So that's to say, I mean, you think that you've got maybe a little bit of a cost advantage over your competitors, so they're not able to quite match you when you make moves like this. Richard Galanti : I'm sorry, what was that? Brandon Cheatham : You have a cost advantage, a little bit of a cost advantage, compared to your competitors. When you take prices down, they can't quite match you. And so that's why you're able to get your price gaps as wide as they have been? Richard Galanti : Well, I think it's our model versus other models. We respect and have very formidable competitors, whether it's other warehouse clubs or big box discounters or supermarkets. And we're all doing what we can do to maximize our own respective model. So I think certainly, when we make some price changes to things, we see our competitors act to them in some cases and not in others. I think the fact that we have fewer items and we're out there every week, I know that our merchants, when they see those comp shops, I'm making this up, that there's 100 items, and we're the same on 50 and lower on 45 and higher on 5, those 5 better be changed this week. And so I know we're on top of it. I can't speak to our competitors, but I assume they are also. But we have a model, a cost structure, that allows us to mark up our goods, on average, in the low teens compared to traditional retailers in the mid-20s to 100. So we have a little room there. Brandon Cheatham : Got it. Sam's Club recently announced that they've changed course and start opening doors. I'm wondering, does that impact you at all on your opening plans? Would you locate in the same place even if you knew they'd be opening nearby? Or would that preclude you from the area? Richard Galanti : No, we're going to open where we want to open certainly whether it's an existing open location or something that we're aware of based on what's going on in the real estate activity out there, which we all know what everybody is doing in advance in a way. And so does it impact us? It may impact us in some examples, whether it's Sam's or somebody else, to push this one more soon. And look, I was going to say, when you asked about them announcing they're going to open more doors, I think they said they're going to open up about 30 over the next 5 or so years, 5 or 6 years. They apparently didn't get the memo that they should close some more. I'm just kidding. Look, we respect them as a competitor, and we don't see that changing what we do. I think it bodes well, though, that there's plenty of capacity still in this country, of course, other countries, even more so. Operator : Your last question today comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Scott Mushkin : I have tons. But I guess the first thing I wanted to ask a little bit, you gave the regional sales kind of which regions were better. I mean, obviously, there's been a lot of layoffs in tech, and you have a huge business out in California. Are you seeing that business underperform relative to just over a couple of month period? That's my first one. Richard Galanti : Not really. My guy is here looking at the numbers, and they're saying not really. One of the things that Josh mentioned is, well, we have 400 locations. 400-plus of our 550-ish location in the U.S. have gas, that's even a bigger percentage in California, and higher volume gas units. And with gas inflation coming down dramatically year-over-year, that's partly why they're not the best performers. If you took that out, there's not a whole big difference out there. Scott Mushkin : And just curious, and maybe this is a silly question, what happens with that gas business, especially in California, with the push to EVs? Richard Galanti : It's a long road ahead. We only have 11 carwashes. So we have plenty of room for carwashes 30 years from now. But at the end of the day, we think it's a very long road. It's not happening in the next few years. And the fact that we're still taking such market share relative to U.S. gas gallons in general is a positive. So I think it's a question that we can defer for 5 or 10 years, frankly. Scott Mushkin : Yes, tell this to the California guy. My last question, I know this call has gone long, just wondering about a little bit long term the initiatives. You had a big push into fresh several years ago. It's obviously worked out really well. We had the credit card. We had the big push in the big ticket. Is there anything on the horizon like that, that will change the business a little bit and maybe grow it a little faster? Richard Galanti : Well, international, in general, there's plenty of opportunities. If you look at some of the foreign countries, as a percent of sales, they are more profitable than the U.S. So those things, that creates more opportunity. I don't see anything big right now coming on vertical integration. Might we do another poultry activity at some point, but that's still a few years down the road to even consider. We did a second meat plant outside of Chicago for the Midwest and East Coast just a couple of years ago. We're expanding our bakery commissary. So there's nothing, another couple of hundred million dollar plus projects going on like that. I think another area that I think bodes well for us in terms of competitiveness and continuing to work on getting prices down is working with suppliers, certain things that we currently ship from the U.S., elsewhere, or air freight in the case of produce elsewhere, there's plenty of activity going on what I'll call the hot house side, could you grow more vegetables. But that's all good in concept, but it takes time to figure out. And there's plenty of people trying to figure it out, and so we're waiting for that. The other thing I think I gave an example a few years ago, of something as simple as cashews. Historically, they're all grown and washed and prepped for roasting in Eastern Africa, shipped to America for roasting, quality roasting, packaging and then shipped out to the 13 or 14 countries. Today, those that are ultimately sold in Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and China, are now shipped to Vietnam to a quality roaster supplier of ours. They grew over time with us. And we dramatically lowered the cost on that portion of a huge amount of dollars, and then using that to do what we normally do, take 80% or 90% of that savings and lower the price even further in those countries. There's plenty of opportunities. Now we're now talking with big suppliers of these hundred- and multi-hundred-million dollar items that we buy, whether it's paper goods, plastic items, things like that, which of these items could be produced overseas, particularly on the Asia side, rather than having to produce them here and ship them there. There's a lower cost of production and as long as we can maintain that quality. And so I think there's going to be lots of little opportunities that become, in total, a good opportunity for us. Richard Galanti : Well, thank you, everyone. We're around. I'm sure we'll be talking to a few of you today and tomorrow and early next week. Have a good afternoon or evening. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Costco Wholesale Corporation's fiscal Q3 2023 conference call. [Operator instructions] Thank you. Richard Galanti, CFO, you may begin your conference. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Josh, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the 12 weeks ended this past May 7. Reported net income for the quarter was $1.30 billion or $2.93 per diluted share. This compared to $1.35 billion or $3.04 per diluted share a year ago in the third quarter. This year's results included a nonrecurring charge to merchandise costs of $298 million pre-tax or $0.50 per share, primarily for the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities. Last year's results included a nonrecurring $77 million pre-tax charge or $0.13 per share for incremental employee benefits. As many of you know, two years ago, we initially leased three ships and thousands of containers to help mitigate some of the significant overseas freight challenges that we were experiencing. Later, we added four additional vessels and several thousand additional containers with commitments made for up to then three additional years. Procuring these ships and containers was integral to us being able to stay in stock for our members during those challenging times. It also allowed us to do so initially at a lower cost than the market rates at that time. Shipping and freight markets have improved dramatically since that time, which led us to reevaluate our position. As you recall, in the first quarter of this fiscal year, we took a charge to downsize by two vessels our charter shipping activities. Since then, shipping and container rates have continued to fall. And in the third quarter, this third quarter, we concluded that it would be appropriate to completely discontinue the remainder of our charter shipping activities. As a result of this decision, we recorded an impairment charge for all remaining charter assets. This decision allows our merchandising teams to take full advantage of the current shipping market rates as opposed to much higher contracted charter rates. In turn, this allows us to do what we do best and lower prices for our members. In terms of sales. Net sales for the third quarter increased 1.9% to $52.6 billion versus $51.61 billion reported last year in the third quarter. Comparable sales for the quarter were as follows : in the U.S., on a reported basis, minus 0.1%, and excluding gas deflation and FX, plus 1.8%; Canada, reported, minus 1%, ex gas and FX, plus 7.4%; and Other International, reported, plus 4.1%, and ex gas and FX, plus 8.4%. So total company, on a reported basis, 0.3% comp sales, and ex gas deflation and FX at plus 3.5%. And our e-commerce on a reported basis was minus 10% and minus 9%, excluding FX. In terms of third quarter comp sales metrics. Traffic or shopping frequency remains pretty good, increasing 4.8% worldwide and 3.5% in the U.S. during the quarter. Our average daily transaction or ticket was down 4.2% worldwide and down 3.5% in the U.S., impacted, in large part, from weakness in bigger-ticket nonfood discretionary items. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.5%, and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.7%. Next on the income statement is membership fee income. For the quarter, we reported $1.044 billion of membership fee income or 1.98% of sales compared to $984 million or 1.91% a year ago in the third quarter, so a $60 million or 6.1% increase in membership fees. Excluding the headwinds in FX, the $60 million increase would have been higher by $17 million or up year over year 8%, adjusted for FX. In terms of renewal rates, at third quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 92.6%, and our worldwide rate came in at 90.5%. These figures are the same all-time high renewal rates that were achieved in the second quarter, just 12 weeks ago here. Membership growth continues. We ended Q3 with 69.1 paid household members and 124.7 million cardholders, both up approximately 7% versus a year ago. At third quarter end, we had 31.3 million paid executive members, an increase of 681,000 or 57,000 per week during the 12-week fiscal third quarter. Executive members now represent a little over 45% of our paid members and approximately 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement. Next is our gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the third quarter was higher year over year on a reported basis by 13 basis points, coming in at 10.32% as compared to a 10.19% number a year earlier. The 13 basis point positive ex gas deflation was minus 3 basis points. Both of these numbers, of course, includes a little more than 50 basis point impairment charge to margin mentioned in today's earnings release. As I normally do, I'll ask you to jot down a few numbers, two columns : a reported column and then column excluding gas deflation. The first item would be, for the third quarter of '23, core merchandise margin. On a reported basis, it was up year over year 39 basis points and ex gas deflation, up 24; ancillary and other, plus 13 and plus nine; 2% Reward, minus 11 and minus nine; LIFO, plus 25 and plus 25; and other, minus 53 and minus 52. If you add up the two columns, again, you get to the reported number of, on a reported basis, gross margin year over year in the quarter was up 13 basis points, and ex gas deflation, down 3 basis points. So starting over the core. Again, core was up, on a reported basis, 39 basis points year over year and 24 ex gas deflation. In terms of core margins on their own core sales, or core-on-core margins, they were higher by 17 basis points, with food and sundries and nonfoods being up and fresh foods being down a little. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin was higher by 13 and again higher by nine ex gas deflation. Within the ancillary businesses, gasoline, business centers, food court and travel were better year over year, offset in part by e-com. 2% Reward, again, higher by 11 basis points and higher by nine ex gas deflation. Higher sales penetration coming from our executive members is certainly part of that. LIFO, plus 25 basis points year over year, both with and without gas deflation. As you recall, a year ago, in the third quarter, we had $130 million charge for LIFO. In this fiscal year, we had no LIFO charge. So $130 million year-over-year improvement on that line item. Note also that in the fourth quarter a year ago, we had a $223 million LIFO charge. So we'll see how that goes in the fourth quarter this year. Other was lower by 53 basis points reported and 52 ex gas deflation. This was net of items for both years. This year, there was a 57 basis point negative impact from the $298 million pre-tax charge, again, primarily related to terminating our charter shipping activities. This was partially offset by lapping last year's $77 million charge for incremental employee benefits, of which $20 million or 4 basis points related to gross margin. The remaining $57 million, I'll talk about it in a minute under SG&A. Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A this year was nine.11% compared to 8.62% a year ago. So on a reported basis, higher by 49 basis points, and ex gas deflation, higher by 34%. As with gross margin, I'll ask you to jot down two columns of numbers, both reported and one excluding gas deflation. First item is operations, higher by 48 basis points and minus 35 basis points; central, minus 11 and minus nine; stock compensation, zero in both columns; preopening, minus one and minus one; other, plus 11 and plus 11. If you add all those up, again, on a reported basis, 49 basis points higher year over year, and ex gas deflation, 34. Now, to core operations. This negative included, of course, the impact of slower sales growth, as well as the impact of a few of the wage increases that we did that are typically out of the normal cycle over the last year -- over a year. And that included the impact of four weeks of wage and benefits increases implemented last March, the additional top-of-scale increase that went into effect July 4, and eight weeks of this March is higher than normal top-of-scale increase. Despite the slowing sales growth, we've continued to invest in our employees over the past year, and that's always been a priority for us. Central, higher by 11 and higher by nine ex gas deflation. Again, sales growth -- there's no big single item that was an outlier there. But sales growth overall, in my view, was the impact. Stock comp, flat both with and without gas deflation, so no impact there. Preopening again, higher by 1 basis point. We had five openings this year in the quarter and three last year but, again, 1 basis point delta year over year. And Other, 11 basis point positive, both with and without gas deflation. This is a result of lapping that $77 million charge, within SG&A, lapping $57 million of that $77 million charge for the incremental employee benefits, again, discussed earlier in the release. Below the operating income line, interest expense came in at $36 million, $1 million over last year's $35 million number. And interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $57 million year over year. This was driven by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates and cash balances. And an increase in interest income was partially offset by less favorable FX versus last year. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the third quarter came in at 26.5%. That compared to 24.9% in Q3 last year. The fiscal '23 effective rate, excluding discrete items, is currently projected to be in the 26% to 27% range. Overall, reported net income was down year over year by 4 percentage points, net of the two nonrecurring items in both years' third quarters. Net income would have been up 8% even being reflected with that higher income tax rate. In terms of warehouse expansion, to date, we've opened 17 locations in the first three quarters and also including three relocations, so net of that, 14 net new locations. In Q4, we have nine new openings with no relos, so net of nine. That will put us at 26 openings, less the three relos, to be a 23 net new for this year. In the quarter, again, we opened five, with four being net new. In addition to the relocation in Canada, we had two new buildings in the U.S. opened, and one additional building opened in each of Japan and China. Again, of the nine new buildings planned for our fiscal fourth quarter, that includes our North Tulsa, Oklahoma opening that opened this morning, and our fourth and fifth buildings in China planned for June and August. These Q4 planned openings will bring our full year account to 26 less the three, or net of 23, and that is made up of 13 in the U.S. and 10 outside of the U.S.  Regarding capital expenditures. In Q3 of the fiscal year, we spent approximately $819 million. Our estimate for all of fiscal '23, capex is approximately $4 billion. Moving on to e-commerce. You saw in the release that e-commerce was a minus 10% sales decline on a comp basis and ex FX, minus 9%. E-com sales, more to the same story in terms of the sales, as I discussed on our second quarter call and in our monthly sales recordings. In Q3, big-ticket discretionary departments, notably majors, home furnishings, small electrics, jewelry and hardware, were down about 20% in e-com and made up 55% of e-com sales. These same departments were down about 17% in warehouse, but they only make up 8% in warehouse sales. A few comments on inflation. Inflation continues to abate somewhat. If you go back a year ago to the fourth quarter of '22 last summer, we had estimated that year over year inflation at the time was up 8%. And by Q1 and Q2, it was down to 6% and 7% and then 5% and 6%. In this quarter, we're estimating the year over year inflation in the 3% to 4% range. We continue to see improvements in many items, notably food items like nuts, eggs and meat, as well as items that include, as part of their components, commodities like steel and resins on the nonfood side. Switching over to inventory levels. Inventories overall are in pretty good shape. As of quarter end, our inventories year over year as of the end of the third quarter were down 7%. Recall that they had been up during some of the supply chain challenges of last year. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending Sunday, May 28, next Thursday on June 1, after market close. And also remember that our fiscal fourth quarter has an extra week this year. So our quarter ending September 3, 2023, will have 17 weeks versus 16 weeks in the fiscal fourth quarter. With that, I'll open it up for questions and answers and turn it back over to Josh. Thank you. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good afternoon, Richard. How broadly and widely is Costco willing to roll back prices in order to drive traffic and sustain a mid-single-digit comp growth? How are you thinking about the prospect of deflation across your entire portfolio? Richard Galanti : Well, look, that's something that our merchants work on literally every day and every week. I remember when inflation was peaking at 8% and 9% and some out there would say -- and we're known for trying to hold the line and work with our suppliers, how much will they eat of that, how much will we eat of that. At the end of the day, if margins year over year were down 50 or 100 basis points back then, that implies that some portion of it, maybe instead of an 8% or 9% increase, our members were seeing a 6% or 7% or 8% increase. Whatever that was, we felt that we were doing as good a job as anyone out there given the item nature of our business to lower prices for our members and hopefully drive sales. Certainly, right now, we're -- we've always been a little bit, compared to others, over indexed in bigger-ticket discretionary items. That's getting hit arguably more than others. If you look at our fresh foods and food and sundries, they're in the mid- to mid-high singles. You look at the nonfoods and some of the ancillaries, notably gasoline, which is 11% year over year deflation in gas prices, that's in the mid-single negatives. So it all adds up to where it is. Every day, we look to drive sales. What will it take to get to whatever X is? Who the heck knows? I just know that our merchants and Craig and Ron and Claudine, our Head of Merchandising, are pushing the buyers each day to do that and figuring out how can we take the monies that we get, any types of monies, from the vendors that can be used to drive business. One of the reasons that it made sense for us to discontinue the containers and the shipping vessels is to reduce the cost that our buyers are seeing relative to these much higher contract rates now. We were smart for a year. And now looking back, it was good to get out of it. And that allowed us to be more competitive as well. So I feel we're doing a great job of being very competitive. When we do comp shops against our direct warehouse club competitors, as well as different components, whether it's retail food or general merchandise on the buildings, home improvement side, we feel very good about our competitive position and what we're doing to do that. Michael Lasser : So are you not expecting broad-based deflation, Richard? And my follow-up question is going to be, given the amount of value you give to your members, wouldn't it make sense to raise your fees right now because your renewal rates have been so high and you would be providing even more value in this difficult economic environment. Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, on the question of deflation, let's hope that there is. And you will be the first to see it at Costco, in my view. As it relates to membership fees, nice try, Michael. But at the end of the day, with the headline being inflation, we feel very good about if we want to do it, can we do it without impacting, in any meaningful way, renewal rates or sign-ups or anything. And at some point, we will. But our view right now is that we've got enough leverage out there to drive business, and we feel that it's incumbent upon us to be that beacon of light to our members in terms of holding them for right now. It's not a matter of a big time, but we'll let you know as soon as we know. Michael Lasser : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Hey, Richard. My first question is on the comps and the stacks. It's obviously been slowing, and you probably took more than your fair share over the last three years. Curious when you sit around how you're diagnosing it, macro, I don't know if it's gas attachment, merchandising, weather, any of those options, how do you diagnose what's happening? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, we look at traffic. We're getting people in the door, and we know what they're buying. They're buying nondiscretionary items. They're buying fresh foods. They're buying food and sundries. They're buying apparel in a big way. They're buying patio furniture now that the weather has turned in a big way; indoor furniture, not as much. We all know what's going on with consumer electronics out there. While all the numbers, industrywide, are down, ours are down a little less, but they're down. So overall, when we look at what else can we do to drive more nonfood business but, at the same time, can we bring in a few more items on the food and sundry side because we know traffic is good there. It's simple impulse items that sell for $15 to $25. So that's what we do every day, and that's what Claudine and her staff and merchants are doing. Simeon Gutman : And then, my follow-up, can you give us some information or color on gasoline gross profit year over year, how that profit pool is trending, obviously, inclusive of both gallons and the penny profit? Richard Galanti : Well, yes, gallons are close to flat. The average price per gallon during the quarter was down 11%. So that's, I don't have the number, 12% or 13% of our sales, which was -- the average price point per cell unit, if you will, was down 11%. year over year, gasoline was profitable in both quarters nicely. As I've said, I'm sure I said last year, in Q3 and this year, it helped a little year over year but not a lot. Last year, in Q4, it was a strong number. And then, you got an extra week, and we'll see how it goes this year. But right now, gasoline continues to be quite profitable for us. Simeon Gutman : OK. Thanks, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Christopher Horvers : Thanks very much and good morning. So I just want to jump back to the pricing question. From a strategy perspective, typically, if you see things that are dis-inflating or deflating on more of the commodity side, you'll take price ahead of that. I guess is that what you're doing currently? And we've heard a lot of talk in the market about the vendors funding more promotions, how are you thinking about the balance between the retailer funding the promotion or the price investment versus the vendors? Richard Galanti : Well, first, look, we work with our suppliers every day and it's going to be a partnership there. Again, I think it's easier for us, on the one hand, that we do a lot of volume on a fewer items. We have buyers that literally are managing a couple of dozen items, not 200 items. And I remember, when certain commodity prices like resins and steel were going up, in our monthly budget meeting hearing from the merchants how, while we're committing out five, six months for seasonal items, like patio furniture, barbecue grills, a couple of years ago, we want to know when the vendor was increasing the price on whatever it was, whether it was a major consumer products company or some manufacturer of nonfood items like that. Why? Exactly why? How much of it's labor? How much of it's the commodity cost? And how much is transportation cost and wage pressure? Whatever. And as we saw commodities coming down, I'd like to think that we were the first ones on the phone with our suppliers wanting to know when the price is going to drop. And understandably, in some cases, the supplier had committed to a season of three or four months. And so, there was some delay, and we worked with them there. In addition, as we said, we're going to invest a little on price. How much are you willing to invest in price? So it's a partnership. And I think we are in a better position to do that simply because, if you take our $230 billion or $240 billion in sales and divide it by 3,800 SKUs, it's a lot more pricing power per SKU and a lot more focus on an item-by-item basis. So that's what we do. And as there are promotional monies out there from the suppliers, this goes back to the beginning of time around here. I remember with the traditional co-op advertising dollars, a supplier wanted you to spend $0.05 of our own money and add it to $0.05 of theirs to do $0.10 of advertising of their product. And we said, just give us the $0.05 and we'll base it on a $0.95 cost, not a dollar cost. And that's what we still do. And so, I think we have to be smart about knowing what every bucket of money is out there, whether it's promotional monies or ad monies, or ad monies online now, and work with our suppliers to do that. And in our case, also, we do what we call the MVM, the multi-vendor mailers, the coupon books that we send out 11 times a year, and not only that but hot buys in-store and what we call temporary price discounts and what can drive sales. The other part of that is, when we get monies, in some cases, how much elasticity is there in driving business by lowering their price. In some categories, particularly some of the bigger-ticket categories right now, there's not an appetite by the consumer necessarily for that. So how do we add value to the item or do more things to it to drive business? It's all of the above. Christopher Horvers : And so, as you look forward, you said, I think, 3% to 4% inflation in the quarter. If you look at the Nielsen data, that was sort of low double digit, right, I mean, Walmart talked about that. So a two-part question, one is, is the difference just mix that you have more fresh commodity exposure? And then, if you project forward that you'll have sort of no inflation potentially six, eight months out, so how do you think about your ability to continue to comp overall? Richard Galanti : Well, when there was low inflation and not an overarching concern about a recession, when the world was seen to be comping three, four, five and six years ago at 2% to 4%, we were 5% to 7%. Our view is, because we got great members buying more with great loyalty and the best prices by a major difference and quality, and so we've succeeded under those. I think right now, in my view, more of it relates to the fact that we're not only dealing with big-ticket discretionary items weakness which, again, when we look at like MPD\u00a0 and everything, we're doing better in most of those categories. Our negative is not as negative as others out there. In addition, we're comparing against two years of outsized growth in some of those things as people were buying things from their home. We saw outsized sales in indoor and outdoor furniture and electronics and TVs and exercise equipment. And so, we're not only comparing against this \"recession\" or concerns about big-ticket items but comparing against uber strength over the last two years prior to that. So I think we'll come out of this fine. We're pretty good at figuring out new items and new things to do. And we're not just focused on how do we drive sales another 1% or 2% but how can we drive sales when bringing in new and exciting stuff. And we continue to do that. And this is anecdotal, but over the last year, year and a half, we've always been very good at taking what I'll call big American cross-scale products, including a lot of KS, and having huge success overseas. We're now, on a conscious basis, figuring out what the unique, exciting overseas items can we bring elsewhere in the world, including the U.S. and Canada. And we're having good experience with some of those things. These are all small things, but there's lots of little small things around here that add up. Christopher Horvers : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is open. Scott Ciccarelli : Good afternoon, guys. Richard, I think you mentioned fresh foods were a bit on the softer side. When you kind of look at the data, is that a function of your members moving to less expensive packaged goods? Or is that more just do the COVID-driven comparisons like you were just talking about on the discretionary side? Richard Galanti : Yes. By the way, when I was talking earlier about down, the margins were a little weaker on fresh. Sales have been fine. In the quarter, again, when you look at a reported total company sales number of 0.3%, or 3.5% ex gas and FX, but within that 0.3% reported, fresh was mid-singles, food and sundries is mid- to high singles, nonfoods was a little over mid-single negative. Scott Ciccarelli : Got it. All right. I'm not sure I understood that. So the second question related to that, though, is are you seeing any other kind of trade, let's call it, trade-down type activity, whether it's more private label sales, etc., that you kind of identified from your members? Richard Galanti : Yes. And by the way, not just in this current \"recession\" or concern for recession, historically, like within fresh protein, we've always seen when there's a recession, whether it was '99 or '00 or '08, '09, '10, we would see some sales penetration shift from beef to poultry and pork. We have seen some of that now. I think anecdotally, I heard a few months ago from our Head of Food and Sundries buyer, that we saw some switch even to some canned products, like canned chicken and canned tuna and things like that. But on the KS side, we've also seen that. I think last quarter, I mentioned that on a year-over-year basis, there's a 150 basis point increase in private label sales penetration. And this year, at the end of the quarter, it's 120 basis points. So still, over a full percentage point delta in sales penetration. If you go back over the last 10 years, my guess is that on a year-over-year basis, maybe we've gone from, I'm guessing, 22% or 23% to 25% or 26%. So call it, 300 basis points over 10 years or eight years. So 30 to 50 basis points versus 120 and 150 in the last couple of quarters. So yes, that would, again, at least anecdotally, suggest that we've seen people looking for better bargains. We try to correct people when they said was it a downgrading because, arguably, it was an upgrade when they went to Kirkland Signature. Scott Ciccarelli : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Karen Short : Hey. Thanks very much. Good to talk to you. Two questions. One is your pre-tax margin is one of the highest that I think I've seen in the model, like I'm not even sure I could go back to when it was as high as it was. So I'm curious if you could just make some color or commentary on that. And then, the second question I had was not that we're necessarily going into a deflationary environment in food, but if we were to go into a deflationary environment in food, what would be the deleverage you would see on the EBIT line on that front? Richard Galanti : Well, I'd be remiss if I even can think of a number off the top of my head here. In our view, first of all, in a deflation, we'll be the first out there lowering prices with it. And I'd like to think that we could drive business with it. The other thing is look at even something like gasoline. I think all retailers out there that have gasoline operations have, in the last few years, reflected higher profitability from gas. In our view, we have higher profitability, and we have the most extreme savings versus everybody else, so we've been able to make a little more per gallon because others have decided to make more than a little more. And I think that same thing holds true elsewhere. When we look at our competitive price shops against our direct club competitors and against others on key items like fresh with supermarkets, again, those price gaps between us and our competition have not changed. They're still as strong as we feel they should be. And so, again, it's hard to say what -- your comment about some of the highest pre-tax margins, let's face it, I remember looking at even like SG&A, which was up year over year, of course. If you go back pre-COVID, I think our SG&A on a reported basis had a 10 in front of it. It was like 10.1% or 10%. And our view is could it even ever get below 10. And with COVID and crazy sales for two years, we benefited, of course, more than we were detrimented by COVID in many of our categories. And we got down below nine. And of course, normalized, it's still better than it was, and margins are still better than they were, so I think some of it is sustainable. Wages are not going to go down. The question is will they continue to go up. Again, we're going to be ahead of that, too, in terms of wanting to make sure we take care of our employees. But let's assume that a big chunk of that is -- if overall inflation subsides a little bit, I think we'll see a little less wage pressure. But look, as you know, Karen, with us, it's top line sales mostly. And the biggest thing can affect anything. I think we've shown that even with some lesser top line sales, we've been able to pull the levers in a way that still allows us to drive bottom line. And we'll continue to be pragmatic about it, but we'll have to wait and see. Karen Short : Sorry, just to follow up on that. So is there any way to frame what ex gas, ex gas margins, ex fuel prices -- like, what delta in sales would result in a delta in EBIT? Richard Galanti : Well, it's hard to say. Karen Short : Is there any way to calculate that? Richard Galanti : Not really. I mean, we used to look at almost like the old Y equals an X plus B model. Based on incremental sales, what's the variable rate of expenses in a warehouse. And in our collective view, this goes back several years, but our collective view was you needed somewhere around 4.5%, whether it was 4% or 5% of a comp number, to have flat SG&A or flat expenses at the warehouse. Certainly taking the weakness right now in big-ticket items and then taking the weakness of gas deflation, those things impact that SG&A percentage more than anything. When I look every month at our budget meetings, when the operators report on labor productivity, for example, in fresh, we're still improving in the 3% to 6% labor productivity and pounds of protein, processing pork, poultry and meat through the system. When we look at front-end labor or warehouse labor, not the ancillary business or the fresh foods or anything, but labor hours, we've shown labor productivity. Now, in the last year, with a little slowing of sales and with three unusual additional wage increases, that's going to still show a labor percent number higher as a percent of sales, which is our single biggest SG&A item, bigger than other things. But look, at the end of the day, we're still a top line company. In our view, that will mend all things. I'm sure we'd like to see something pre-inflation, back in the 5% to 7% or 8% range. But let's get from where we are now to 3% and 4%, and we'll go from there. Now, the good news also is, if I look back the last -- well, this is the second quarter that we've seen that discussion of lower sales of big-ticket discretionary items. It started actually, I think, a little bit in the quarter prior to that, not the entire quarter, just a little bit in there. So if you will, all things being equal, we'll be comparing against easier compares six months from now. But hopefully, we can do them on our own as well. Karen Short : That makes sense. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. John Heinbockel : So Richard, core-on-core, food and sundries and nonfood were up, right? So it's kind of a two-part on core-on-core. One, what drove that, right? Was that predominantly mix?\u00a0 And then, secondly, fresh food was down. Where is fresh food versus '19? And are we kind of getting to the point where that erosion is going to stop, right, because we're pretty close to '19? Richard Galanti : Yes. Look, fresh foods are still up year over year on margins. Unknown speaker : No, versus '19. Richard Galanti : Oh, versus '19, right. Fresh foods margins are up versus '19. It went way up. Hold on a minute. I had a little cheat sheet. Yes, if I look back at just fresh foods, if I go back to '21, we had a couple of quarters where fresh foods margins were up 200 and 300 basis points year over year. By the end of '21, this was near the end of -- just lapping that craziness, that crazy goodness, we were down 190 basis points. And for all of '22, we were down anywhere from 50 to 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis, some of that compared to those plus 200 and 300 basis point numbers. This year, we're down again versus last year but down versus that giant increase in fiscal '21. When I look at where our food gross margin is today in Q3 versus pre-COVID, we're still up. John Heinbockel : OK. But the other categories that were up, right, is that predominantly mix, private brand and less big ticket? Richard Galanti : Yes. I think it's mixed. Like, some of the nonfood strength, as I mentioned, I threw out apparel as one of them, apparel has a strong margin. Apparel has a strong margin relative to all of our departments anyway. And majors has a weak margin generally anyway and then, of course, lower penetration of that. By the way, freight has helped too, particularly on big-ticket items, the furniture, the white goods, exercise equipment, things like that. John Heinbockel : And then, secondly, where are we on the personalization journey, right? Because I know you've done more data analytics in the last couple of years. You've got the old loyalty program, right? So when you think about wallet share and targeting promotions and emails and so forth, it looks like a huge opportunity. Where are we on that? Richard Galanti : Sure. By the way, one other question that we've gotten a couple of times of late because of some of the companies out there that reported much higher shrink, our shrink is intact. We haven't seen any major change in shrinkage. It fluctuated a couple, 3 basis points up really before COVID as we rolled out self-checkout. And since then, it's come back down a little bit. And so, it's been a very tight range. And so, we've been fortunate in that regard. In terms of where we are in personalization, for those of you on the call that have known me forever, it was probably four years ago that we talked about that sometime soon, we'll do targeting and after that, do personalization. Well, we're still in the early innings. But I guess what I'd like to tell you, and I think I mentioned this on the last quarter's call, just under a year ago, we hired a new VP of Digital, Digital Transformation, if you will, both in e-com and mobile sites and applications, that complemented three other outside VPs we hired, one of which was in the data analytics area. And we've really, over the last six to nine months, began a two-year road map to improve and replatform our primary e-commerce website and the same goes for our mobile apps and mobile site. Working, of course, again, with the data analytics people, the architect people, as well as the business users, we're currently building and dramatically increasing the number of engineering capabilities that we have. And we're on our way. But I'd say we're in the early innings. First order of business, which we now feel we've gotten to a much better clean data site. We're still sending you too many emails a week that don't pertain specifically to what you do. But I think you're going to see incremental changes, and I'll be able to hopefully report more on that at the next quarterly call. And just in the last three months, as an example, we've had three small releases to our mobile app that are improvements of it. And we're now on plans to have small improvements in that app each month for the several months going forward. As you know, you've heard me say for the past couple of years that we're in the early innings. I'll repeat that. We are, but we actually got, I think, a good game plan, and you'll see more to that over the future. A little longer than we had hoped to do some of this stuff, but I think we're on our way in that regard. John Heinbockel : OK. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Oliver Chen : Hi, Richard. When you think about household income, what kind of trends are you seeing in terms of your customers and people trading in and the new Costco at large? And then, the big-ticket item question, what are your thoughts on how you're planning inventory there? Do the compares ease? Do you expect improvement? And within big ticket, any color in terms of how that may proceed sequentially? Richard Galanti : Sure. Our annual household income has actually gone up a little, but I think that's more to do with wage increases than anything. We still over-index to higher-end people, higher-end income people. And so, that's still there. As it relates to our inventories, again, if you had asked me six months ago -- in fact, I think it was Q4 and Q1 where year over year inventories were up 26% as was our competitors and everybody else. A lot of that has to do with, one, some people had enough big-ticket items but also just the terrible supply chain challenges that we all had. And since then, like others, we've shown a reduction in that dramatically, and that's good. We feel pretty good about where we stand right now. Some of you have noted and called us on back, again, six, five, four, three months ago, we had a lot of promotional things going on. If you bought three-or-more-thousand dollars of these 10 items, and they were all like different patio items or different in-store furniture items, if you did $3,000 or more, you got a $500 cash card on already great pricing. And that was a lot of our promotional money, markdown money, to get our inventories back in line, particularly on things where we were over-inventoried because of the supply chain delays. And then, on some examples, I think air conditioners might be an example. Because of the supply chains last summer, we did great in selling through fans and air conditioners. And these are not exact numbers, but let's say we plan to sell $500 million of it, easily 20%, 25% of it got here after the summer because of the supply chain challenges. There is no need to mark those down to try to get rid of them in September, October. We held them, and we're selling through them now, and that's not an issue at all. So in talking to Claudine Adamo, our Head of Merchandising, and her nonfood people, we feel pretty good about where we are both on existing inventory levels of what we have in there and, as well as what we've committed to going forward for upcoming seasons, notably back-to-school and Christmas and things like that. Oliver Chen : OK. And Richard, you've made a lot of great strides in Asia and China and other regions. I'd love just some highlights in terms of what's ahead for the back half there. And a second question on that connected consumer experience between digital and physical, are there evolved thoughts in terms of BOPUS and curbside and what your members want and delivering the ultimate convenience? Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, first of all, in terms of expansion outside of the United States, if you look at just even this year, at '23, I think it was, what, 13 and 10. So 60-ish, 60%, 65%, 60% in the U.S., Canada, which I combine as one because it's well saturated, but we're still opening a bunch of units there, and it's our oldest areas. But I see that, over the next five years, going from 65-35 or 60-40 to at least 50-50, if not trending a little bit toward outside the U.S. and Canada. Now that, again, is the same answer I would have given you six, seven years ago for now. And I think that's a function of, one, having more opportunities every day than we thought we had before in the U.S. and Canada, and there's plenty of opportunities going forward elsewhere. But I think you're still going to see us open in Korea, Taiwan a unit each year on a base of somewhere in the mid- to high teens; in Japan, more than a unit a year on a base in the low 30s; a unit a year in Australia, not exactly each year, maybe there's one in one year, none and then two. But in Australia, we've got 14, I believe. And in Europe, most of our units are in the U.K., where we're in the low 30s. We're still going to open one or two a year there or one a year probably there. And we've opened a few others. We opened our fourth in Spain, and we now have two in France and one each in Iceland and Sweden. So a little growth there. But certainly, in China, I mean, China is a big story this year for us. One of the stories is that we opened our first unit in China three and a half, four years ago; our second, a year and a half ago; our third, last December; and three more this year. We're going to be at six at the end of this year. Unknown speaker : Calendar year. Richard Galanti : Yes, I'm sorry, this calendar year, two more this fiscal year and then one more in the fall. So there's certainly more growth there, but that's not a lot of growth relative to some companies that have tried to go in and open 20 somewhere or something. But we feel good about how we do that. But we think there's plenty on -- bottom line, if we're opening 23 to 25 a year, we'd like to be a little 25-plus a year for the next five years and somewhere closer to 30 a year in year six through 10, that would make us feel quite good. And we feel very comfortable that we can do that at this juncture. In terms of curbside, we're not very thrilled about it or maybe a little stubborn about it. We tried it in a few locations a year ago and successfully proved to ourselves we don't like it. And we want you to come in. And now we do have lockers from big-ticket nonfood items. Interestingly, when people do that, they come in and over half of them shop while they're in the location. And one of our challenges, which is a good quality problem to have, is our average volume per warehouse has continued to grow way more than we had thought a few years ago. And last year, we had over 150 locations doing over $300 million, I think over 27 or 28 million doing over $400 million -- or 26. And so, we've had to open more units. And so, we're continuing to look at a lot of places even in the U.S. And we don't get a lot of ask for it, honestly. Now, we're not asking a lot about it either, but we don't get a lot of ask for it. So I don't see that being a big thing. One of the things that we will be doing though, even online, when you go to look at an online product, if we're selling in a warehouse near you based on where you've shopped, in the next several months, cross my fingers, you will be able to say, you can go ahead and get it in store at the Kirkland from Esquire location, which also has it in stock right now. Same-day grocery, of course, we already have with delivery, mostly with Instacart. We partner with a couple of other people as well, but they're the big kahuna there, both in the U.S. and Canada. And we do two-day dry -- yes. By the way, in that number, which is continuing to grow, is not reported in our income numbers. In that case, their employee or contract employee comes in, shops, rings it up and takes it to you. So that's what we consider a warehouse sale. Oliver Chen : Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Your line is open. Scott Mushkin : Hey. Thanks, Richard for taking the question. So I wanted to talk about competition a little bit. But first, shorter term, and maybe I missed the answer to this if it was asked, promotional activities now, are they -- one of your competitors said they kind of ramped up. Is that what you're seeing as well? Richard Galanti : Yes. It's higher than it was. Now, mind you, it was a lot lower for a couple of years because of the supply chain challenges. I mean, every TV we could sell, whatever, particularly on the nonfood, we could sell, every paper good we could sell, we actually took some items out of like the MVM mailers on the sundries side because, one, there were shortages like paper goods, why promote it when, first of all, we've got to limit one per customer. And so, some of those comparisons, there's more versus a lot less for a couple of years as well. But yes, we are seeing more now. Scott Mushkin : And is that purely from the vendors? Or is that some activities you're seeing from retailers themselves? Richard Galanti : Well, I can speak for us. Yes, I mean, certainly, when we see something that other retailers are doing, we want to make sure we ask our supplier. Maybe they can't tell us, but we're putting the pressure on to know that we're seeing some unusual things out there. And we'll only hold -- sometimes we see better deals the following day to us. So we just got to stay on top of that. As I said a little earlier, I think we've got a lot of levers to pull. Certainly, all retailers that have gas right now has continued to be helped with that. Unusual things, like fresh has been relatively strong, and so we feel good about that. Even for like apparel, which is close to an $8 billion business for us worldwide, $7-plus billion business worldwide, that's been strong. So that's not promotional. That's just better margins, in some cases. Scott Mushkin : OK. So then I wanted to talk a little bit more long term about competition. It's been a long time, I think, what we've seen as many openings from non-Costco people. You are going to see that over the next year or two, three. The other competitors also, they tout their omnichannel and their technology about just scanning and going. Just give us an overall view of the competitive environment over the next one to three years and how Costco fits, and whether you think some of those technologies and e-com stuff are competitive advantages for people that are competing against you? Richard Galanti : Well, I think we're fortunate in one way that, first and foremost, the biggest value attribute or customer attraction attribute is the best-quality goods at the lowest price, and we dwarf everybody in that regard. I mean, our average markup on goods is in the low double digits, 12%, 13%. You know what they are at other traditional retailers, anywhere from 25% to 35% to 100%. So we have that extreme benefit to start with. Arguably, we've been somewhat simple, in our own arrogant way, over the years. One of the things we've done, as I mentioned earlier, on the question that John, I think, had, forget about personalization, even target marketing, I view it now as some low-hanging fruit that we're finally going around to do over the next couple of years. So that will be a positive to us relative to others. In terms of the benefit of buying online and picking up in store and things like that, we, frankly, view that as more costly than it is beneficial. And again, we haven't been asked a lot about it other than by analysts who are responding, in fairness, to the different retailers that feel they have to do it. Many of them want to do it. But there's a cost of doing that. So we feel pretty good about driving the business. We think we can certainly do more online. We don't have some strategic goal to go from 8%, which is still a $20 billion business, but to go from 8% of sales to 16%. But let's go from 8% to 9% to 10%, 10% to 11% over a certain period of time. And we think that, with some of the things we're doing on that side, we can. I think we've also done an incredible job, day in and day out, on the merchandising side of bringing in more exciting items. And that's something that is focused on that I hear about at every budget meeting and every Monday morning meeting with Greg and Ron and a few other senior colleagues, including our merchandising head. So I think that's what's going to keep driving our business. I think we are getting better on the technology side. Playing from behind a little bit on that, but I think we've finally got a game plan and some people that are helping build those areas up both from a marketing and advertising standpoint, taking advantage of the advertising dollars that are out there that we've done pretty well despite ourselves but we know we can do a lot better in grabbing some of those dollars. And what we will use it for is to drive sales. Scott Mushkin : And the club openings, I don't think you touched on that. Richard Galanti : The big club opening thing is we're on our target. I think the last three years, there was a big down year because of the first year of COVID. But fiscal '21, '22 and '23, I think we averaged around 23 net new units a year, 22, 23. We'd like to get above 25 over each of the next five years and closer to 30 year six through 10. That's kind of the game plan. And that really is a bottom-up approach by each of the eight U.S. geographic regions, the two Canadian regions and every other country region, working with operations in our real estate department kind of which ones are likely and what's our priority. And we feel pretty comfortable we've got a good pipeline of pending openings, for sure, over the next three or four years and with an equal level of comfort that we feel that we'll continue to have plenty of opportunities to open units. Scott Mushkin : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Your line is open. Brandon Cheatham : Hey, Richard, this Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. I want to follow up on what you mentioned about the digital investments that you all are making. It sounds like it's something that eventually you might monetize partnering with your vendors. How do you balance that with your view that you really want your members in your warehouse? And how do you see that working kind of over the long term? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, as part of that monetizing of digital is in warehouse. We've been very successful at moving the needle, if you will, on a holiday weekend with hot prices on strip steaks or, at the beginning of the season, with the planting season, with green items. And so, I think it's just we're getting around and doing a better job of it, and we're bringing in people that have done it before, frankly. Even in membership marketing, Sandy Torrey, Senior VP of Membership and Marketing, she's doing more things today than we did even a year ago, trying some things. And again, I think that our first order of business is to drive business in store, certainly driving it online as well, but not to just replace what's in store. Again, I tried to stay a little low key on this subject because we're not -- I hate to use the word this new strategic effort. But what we've learned over the last few years is everybody is a technology company today, and there are some things that we have been a little slow to doing, and we know there's a lot of opportunity there to do some of the even basic things. Not how do you get five emails a week that none of which relates specifically to you. If it was an email, even just based on a couple of items you purchased in store that had a banner of items that you might be interested in, you could literally double the click rate on them. So those are the kind of things that bringing in the fore, what we call catalyst VP hires, in our IT department over the last few years. One is data analytics and one is digital, and it's not just two individuals, it's the teams that they have built in short order. So we'll continue to do that and tell you more as we go along. Brandon Cheatham : Got it. And if I could follow up on the membership side, you mentioned membership marketing. Are you seeing any difference in promotions from your competitors for their memberships? How has that informed what you all are doing? And is there any major change on promotions, on membership from your competitors? Richard Galanti : Well, for us, there's really no change. I mean, we do a few promotional things each year. But the biggest thing that we don't do is in any big way discount our membership. Some of the brochure things that you may sign up for a membership and you get a certain number of coupons related to stuff. I don't want to go into that, but you can look at our competitors and see what they do. There's a lot more promotional activity going on elsewhere. And we're still getting, as I mentioned on the call, year over year 7% increase in new memberships with about just under a 3% increase in number of new warehouses. So we're still getting people indoor. I think in fairness, that's been helped by COVID. We being warehouse clubs was a big cavernous place to come and get a lot of things, and that certainly helped us. I'd like to think we're pretty good at what we do, and that's why more people are signing up, and we're opening new units and driving more business that way. But really, we have not done -- if anything, we've done a little less on the promotional side in membership. We do a few promotional things each year, but not a lot. Brandon Cheatham : Got it. Thank you. Good luck. Richard Galanti : I'm going to take one more question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open. Rupesh Parikh : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.  So in China, I was curious with the reopening there, how the locations are performing versus your expectations. Richard Galanti : They're doing great. End of story. We've been blessed by those first openings that we have over there. Needless to say, we were impacted, like everybody over there, during the shutdown and what have you. And we had some great video clips in our budget meetings here showing what we did to create care packages not only for our members but for the neighborhoods around us. And we were told they were the best care packages of any of the big retailers, so that made us feel good. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then, maybe just one follow-up question. So as you look at your bigger-ticket categories, consumer electronics, etc., any sense at this point whether trends have bottomed? Just curious if you think trends have bottomed or whether we could see further softening in some of these bigger-ticket areas? Richard Galanti : I have one of my colleagues here on the merchandising side, and she was saying to me softly the negatives are getting better. And again, it's about seven or eight months ago, seven-ish months ago, when we started seeing the decline. And so, if nothing else, we'll be having an easier compare five months, hence. But certainly, we've seen a little bit of improvement in the negatives. Rupesh Parikh : All right. Thank you. Richard Galanti : Well, thank you, everyone. David, Josh and I are around to answer questions if you have any more, which I'm sure you will. Have a good afternoon. Operator : [Operator signoff]",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Richard Galanti, CFO. Please go ahead, sir. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, the 17 weeks ended September 3. These results and the figures presented today compare to last fiscal year's 16-week fourth quarter. Reported net income for the 17-week fourth quarter came in at $2.16 billion or $4.86 per diluted share, compared to $1.868 billion or $4.20 per diluted share in the 16-week fourth quarter last year. In terms of sales, net sales for the 17-week fourth quarter were $77.43 billion, an increase of 9.4% from $70.76 billion in the 16-week fourth quarter last year. Comparable sales for the fourth quarter, and these figures are like-for-like number of weeks. In the U.S., reported was 0.2% comp. Excluding gas deflation and FX in the U.S., it would have been 3.1%. Canada, reported was 1.8%, and excluding gas deflation and FX, 7.4%. Other International reported 5.5%, and again excluding gas deflation and FX, 4.4%. Also total Company reported 1.1% comp and 3.8% ex-gas deflation and FX. In terms of e-commerce, that came in at minus 0.8% reported and minus 0.6% excluding FX. Overall for the fiscal fourth quarter, food and sundries were relatively strong once again, with fresh foods right behind and with some offsets on some of the non-foods categories. In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 5.2% worldwide and 5.0% in the United States. Our average transaction or ticket was down 3.9% worldwide and down 4.5% in the U.S., impacted in large part from weakness in bigger ticket non-foods discretionary items, as well as the gas price deflation. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.3%, and gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 2.5%. Next on the income statement, membership fee income reported in the fourth quarter $1.509 billion or 1.95% of sales in the fourth quarter this fiscal year, compared to $1.327 billion or 1.88% in Q4 of last year, so $182 million increase or 13.7%. If you adjust for the extra week, the 13.7% would be roughly 7%, ex that extra week. Excluding FX and the extra week, the increase would have been around 7.5%. In terms of renewal rates at Q4 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates stood at 92.7%, which is up 0.1% from the 92.6% figure as of the end of Q3. The worldwide rate came in at 90.4%, down 0.1%, reflecting the impact of increasing penetration of memberships from international, which renew at a lower rate, in large part because of new openings internationally. Our membership growth continues. We ended the fourth quarter with 71.0 million paid household members, up 7.9% versus a year ago, and 127.9 million cardholders, up 7.6%. That's on the new openings over the past year of - just under 3% increase in new locations. At the fourth quarter end, we had 32.3 million paid executive memberships, an increase of 981,000 during the 17 weeks since Q3 end. The executive members now represent a little over 45% of our paid membership and approximately - paid members and approximately 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement, next is our gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter came in higher - came in at 10.60%, up 42 basis points from 10.18% a year ago, and that 42 basis points is up 16 basis points excluding gas deflation. As I always ask you to jot down a few numbers with two columns, both reported and excluding gas deflation, the first line item would be core merchandise, on a reported basis, up 51 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter and ex gas deflation up 28 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses, minus 32 basis points and minus 38 basis points. 2% reward, minus 4 basis points and minus 2 basis points. LIFO, plus 27 basis points and plus 28 basis points. And if you total that up, on a reported basis, gross margin was up 42 basis points year-over-year and ex gas deflation, up 16 basis points. Starting with the core, again, up 51 basis points year-over-year, and ex deflation, up 28 basis points. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by 35 basis points, with food and sundries and non-foods being up and fresh foods being down a little. Ancillary and other business gross margin was lower by 32 basis points, and lower by 38 basis points ex gas. This decrease was driven almost entirely by gas due to the other components of ancillary and other, which would include pharmacy, e-comm, food court, business centers, optical, all those things on a relative basis year-over-year were in a couple of basis points plus or minus from a year earlier. 2% reward higher by 4 basis points and higher by 2 basis points, so a negative 2 basis points including gas deflation. That represents higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. And LIFO, of course, if you recall, last year in Q4, we had a $223 million pre-tax LIFO charge, while there was a small charge this year of $30 million on a year-over-year basis. Of course, that showed the basis point improvement in margin. While we continued - we've continue to see sequential improvement in year-over-year inflation. I'll talk about that a little later. We still had a small amount relative to the first day of the fiscal year, that's a small charge in Q4. A couple of final comments on margins. First, we are of - we're asked often recently about our inventory shrinkage results and whether it has dramatically increased in the past year versus historical shrink results. The answer is, no. In the past several years, our inventory shrink has increased by a couple of basis points, in part we believe due to the rollout of self-checkout. Over the past year, it has increased by less than 1 basis point more. So no, thankfully, not a big issue for us. And second, the year-over-year margin improvement has in part been due to fewer markdowns due to better inventory positions this year than last. Our inventories overall are in good shape. Moving onto SG&A, our reported SG&A in the fourth quarter 8.96%, up from 8.53% a year earlier or up 43 basis points, and ex gas deflation up 21 basis points. Again jot down the two columns of numbers, both reported and excluding gas deflation. Operations, minus 37 basis points, minus being higher by and without deflation, core would be minus 18 basis points. Central, minus 6 basis points and minus 3 basis points. And those are the really only two line items. The others were all zero; stock compensation, preopening and other. So, total reported margins were up 43 basis points year-over-year, and ex gas deflation, up 21 basis points. In terms of the core operations being higher by 18 basis points ex gas deflation and on a reported basis higher by 37 basis points, this negative included the impact of lower sales growth as well as the impact of eight weeks of additional top-of-scale wage increases that went into effect July 4 of '22, so midway through Q4 last year, and full 17 weeks of this past March's higher-than-normal top-of-scale increase. Central being higher by 3 basis points ex gas deflation, again not a lot of sales operating leverage there. And again, as I mentioned, the other line items that I typically read out were flat, both with and without gas deflation, so zero year-over-year change. Below the operating income line, interest expense came in at $56 million this year versus $48 million a year ago, one extra week, of course. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $171 million year-over-year, $238 million this year versus $67 million last year. This was driven in large part by an increase in interest income due to both higher interest rates and higher cash balances, as well as the extra week. In addition, FX was slightly favorable year-over-year. In terms of income tax rate, our tax rate this year in the fourth quarter came in at 27.1% compared to 25.4% in Q4 last year, so full 1.7 percentage points higher year-over-year. This increase in our rate as of Q4 is primarily attributable to an increased penetration of international earnings, which overall incurs a higher income tax rate than in the U.S. Overall, reported net income was up 16% year-over-year in the quarter, or 9% if you adjust for the extra week this year quarter - this year in the fourth quarter versus last. A few other items of note, in the fourth quarter, we opened nine net new warehouses, including five new buildings in the U.S., two in China, and one each in Japan and Australia. For the full fiscal '23 year, we finished with 23 net new units, as well as we did three relocations. And for the first quarter, the first 12 weeks of fiscal '24, we plan on opening 10 net new units, as well relocating one unit. All 10 locations net new are in - nine are in the U.S. and one is in Canada. Regarding capital expenditures, we've actually included the cash flow in the quarterly report, but CapEx spend in Q4 was approximately $1.56 billion, and for all of fiscal '23, totaled $4.32 billion. Turning to e-commerce, e-commerce sales in the fourth quarter ex FX, as I mentioned, decreased 0.6% year-over-year. While still negative, relatively speaking, our e-commerce showed good improvement. Results showed good improvement this quarter versus our year-over-year results in Q2 and Q3. In the previous two fiscal quarters, big ticket discretionary majors, home furnishings, small electrics, jewelry and hardware, were down 15% and 20% year-over-year, respectively, and down just 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, with those big ticket departments making up over half of our e-commerce sales. A couple of other items to note. Within the sales of big ticket discretionary, appliance were up over 30% in the quarter. Second, I've gotten a couple of calls that people have seen online that we've been selling gold - 1-ounce gold bars. Yes, but when we load them on the site, they're typically gone within a few hours and we limit two per member. And lastly, I'll point out Costco Next. We continue to grow that. We currently have 62 suppliers on costconext.com, and we're continuing to onboard additional ones in many product areas, from home improvement to apparel, to pet, to home and kitchen, to electronics and accessories, to sports and bicycles and toys and the like. Now, a few comments on e-com mobile digital efforts, which we're always asked about. As I discussed during the last quarter earnings call, when I said that we were in the early innings of our digital mobile transformation efforts, progress is being made. In terms of recent additions and upgrades, we've recently redesigned the account page and the digital membership card. We also redesigned the header with larger search bar and expanded selling space. We've added an app box for messages and advertisements right in the app. We've recently, a few months ago, opened an optical digital store where you can virtually try on glasses and then order them for pickup, prescription glasses. And lastly, there are ongoing improvement in our Costco app, offering in-warehouse shopping tools for our customers such as a digital membership card, managing shopping lists, viewing warehouse savings, seeing the gas prices to the extent there's gas station there, and so you'll be able to search warehouse inventory and scan barcodes from the app. With the improvements made thus far over the past year, our app store rating has gone from a dismal 2.3 stars to currently 4.7 stars. Unique visitors in the site are up 40% year-over-year and the Costco app installs are up 46% year-over-year. So all in all, progress is being made. Lastly, a couple of comments regarding inflation, most recently in Q3 '23, we had estimated that year-over-year inflation was in the 3% to 4% range. Our estimate for Q4, inflation in the 1% to 2% range, and it's actually trended downward during the quarter. So hopefully, these inflation trends will continue. We'll have to see. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, October 1, on Wednesday, October 4, after the market closes. With that, I will open it up for Q&A and turn it back over to Lisa. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Hi, Richard. How are you? Richard Galanti : Good. Simeon Gutman : I guess my first question, I don't mean a tongue-in-cheek, but is - I guess, is the membership price increase part of the fiscal plan? And then part of the question is there a point at which this membership increase is part of, I guess the hedge against inflation? Is there a point at which model feels more weight without it, in other words, can you go another year without it? Richard Galanti : Well. My pat answer, of course, is a question of when, not if. It's a little longer this time around, since June of '17. So we're six years into it and - but you'll see it happen at some point. We can't really tell you, if it's in our plans or not. We'll let you know when we know. We feel good. These say about all the attributes of member loyalty and member growth. And frankly, in terms of looking at the values that we provide our members, we continue to increase those. It's certainly a greater amount than even more than if and when an increase occurs. So stay tuned. We'll keep you posted, but there's not a whole lot I can tell you about that. Simeon Gutman : Fair enough. And then an ultra-short term, as gas prices have moved up, have you seen any effect or impact on spending at the store? Richard Galanti : No, I mean, you look at the numbers over the last few months that we report monthly and quarterly. There has not been a heck of a lot change. Big ticket discretionary, while improved relatively as I mentioned online - those online items, we have seen the number of items in the basket tick up a little in the last few months, but I think that has more to do with the fact that we consciously added. I had mentioned in the last call, we've consciously added 40 or 50, what I'll call smaller ticket indulgent items, whether it's snack items and the like, just impulse items. And so that's what we do as merchants, but overall we haven't seen any big change. We've been able to correlate any big change to what's happened with gas prices. Simeon Gutman : Hi, thanks, Richard. Good luck. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning - good afternoon, I should say. Thank you so much for taking my question. Richard, you ended your prepared remarks, saying that this quarter or this month inflation is on pace to be 1% to 2% and you suggested it may be even lower than that. So should outside of the reverse be prepared for the prospect of deflation, either because that's what's happening with some underlying cost that Costco has been experiencing or Costco will look to invest in price, as a way to continue to drive volumes, especially at a time when core on core margins are expanding, so nicely? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, your comment that there was 1% to 2%, but then as we looked at the 17 weeks if you are the four months roughly, we saw - if we look at it internally at each of the end of those four months, we saw the level that 1% to 2% is from the beginning to the end of the year - I'm sorry, the beginning at the end of the quarter. But during the quarter, we saw that trending downward, if you will, a little. And when I talk to the merchants on the fresh side, it's flat-to-down a little right now on the food and sundries side, it's up a little, primarily in some of the CPG stuff and on big-ticket - not big-ticket, but our non-foods partly because of freight, which is down year-over-year in a nice way. And in some cases, some of the commodity costs on steel and the like that has come down. So that being said, we're not a big change, but at least it's trending that way. Who knows what tomorrow brings. And as it relates to - well, as I say, as it relates to us, we're always pushing prices as fast as we can. We want to be the first to lower them when those things happen and drive sales. Michael Lasser : And so... Richard Galanti : I think we've seen that with - I think we've seen that with our traffic. Simeon Gutman : So just to clarify what you're saying is food and sundries prices are down on an average year-over-year, shelf-stable products are up year-over-year, gen merch is down. So in totality, it would seem like the store - the box is deflating, does it get - does the rate at which you see deflation continue to increase from here and would you expect that to be just driven by the factors that you mentioned or are you driving that as a way to drive this traffic? Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, I want to correct one thing that it maybe I misstated or you misunderstood. In terms of fresh, fresh is pretty much flat. Food and sundries, which has everything from sundries and package goods and CPG goods that tends to be up a little bit. And I'd like to think that we're pushing the envelope as much as we can with our suppliers that has certain freight costs have come down. Recognizing the headline today in the paper is - oil is approaching $100 a barrel. So, who the heck knows what happens tomorrow. Michael Lasser : Okay. My follow-up question is, as low - as long as you see big-ticket under pressure, discretionary under pressure, which influences your total sales, because it's important for you to remember to come in and buy these big-ticket items. Is this going to influence how you think about managing labor in the store? Should the market just anticipate late - labor and other SG&A is going to delever as long as the big tickets under pressure? Richard Galanti : Well, I think we've seen that over the last year, frankly. We had such operating leverage over a couple of years when we had outside sales during the kind of two years of COVID, call the spring of '20 to spring of 2022. And, it was before COVID, when our SG&A was over 10% - slightly over 10%, and we said, would it ever be able to get below that, it's now still below 9%. So, notwithstanding the fact, when I looked at the last several quarters on a year-over-year basis, again, particularly over the last couple of quarters, we've seen some deleverage of that. Look, we want to drive sales and we'll do that in the best ways we can. So - but we recognize when we used to get the question all the time, what comp number do you need to have zero, negative or positive leverage with SG&A, recognizing there was low - very little inflation back then. We used to say somewhere, who knows, but somewhere in the 4.5% to 5% range. So we don't know exactly where it is, but we're certainly not going to change the level of service that we have and we're certainly - you're going to respect our employees in terms of what we've done with wage increases overtime. That's what we do. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much and good luck. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Chuck Grom : Hi, Richard. Just sticking on this - on the inflation topic here on unit elasticity, particularly in categories where you're seeing prices actually start to fall or compress. Curious, what you're seeing on units, if you're seeing them improve at all to offset those price declines, if there's any examples in either food or in GM that you can talk about? Richard Galanti : Well, yes, I remember when we talked to a few quarters ago about some of the slowness in big-ticket discretionary, well, we got harder on price. It did a little bit, but not as much as we would have thought to start with. But again, that perhaps was the impact of what's going on with the concerns of the economy and everything else. We know that when we put hard buys and what we call TPDs, temporary price discounts on items, even medium-sized ticket items, we do see - we do leverage - see the units increase, but it's not as predictable I would say as it used to be. Chuck Grom : Okay, great. And I know you don't provide guidance, but I got... Richard Galanti : It's a little easier on the food side to see that sometimes more, when taking the price of meat item down. Chuck Grom : Okay. So you are starting to see some units increase as prices drop in certain parts of the business? Richard Galanti : Sure. And by - even a big-ticket, when we see $300 and $400 price declines because of freight and raw material cost on some big-ticket non-food items, we'll see some of the sales pick back up on that. But, there's nothing guaranteed. Chuck Grom : Okay. All right. Thank you. And I know you don't provide guidance, but I actually do remember when you did give some directional help back in the day, but are there any big puts and takes that we should be thinking about on the gross margin and SG&A line over the next four quarters that we should be thinking about? Clearly, the LIFO lap will be it will be an obvious tailwind, but just curious, any other things that we should be thinking about from a modeling perspective? Richard Galanti : No not really. I mean, LIFO is certainly one that was impacted over the last year and started to slow down. Assuming that trend continues, there won't be much LIFO going forward for right now what we see. Beyond that, no, we're still opening. We opened 23 net new units this past year. We're on board to do something in the mid-to-high 20s this year. But that's not enough to move the needle in terms of the leverage standpoint or anything. No, I'd say it's steady as she goes. And if anything I look to be the margins overall, given everything that's going on, including competition that we're doing pretty well there. We - with some of the wage hikes that we continue to do and sales being a little weaker than they had been a year ago, I think we're doing pretty well on that as well. We're optimistic about our future, but we'll see what happens. Chuck Grom : All right, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Peter Benedict with Baird. Peter Benedict : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Richard, just - first one, just on LIFO. I was just curious, I mean, $30 million charge is small, but I'm just curious, why they were even last one. Can you give us little more color, maybe what drove? Richard Galanti : Yes, well, I think it was on things like gas was one, and then in some of the fresh food items there was - even though there was deflation in things like eggs and some dairy products, there was - there were some inflationary trends and beef. Beyond that, do you have that handy. Yes, it's really small, but on $16 billion of inventory, it's a lot. I mean, it's still a small number of $30 million and that, but - that's all. I don't have the details on that. Peter Benedict : That's fine. Yes, that's fine, just in the context of the broader disinflation it was interesting to see that. And then, just really turning to the international stuff you talked about the rural rates impact, can you remind us maybe on the international membership trends, when you open up a new core outside the U.S., maybe give us some framework or some benchmarks around how many new members tend to sign-up? How does that compare to what you would see, let's say in the next opening in the U.S.? And then, what kind of renewal rates you tend to see year-one, year two, just so we have a frame of reference there? Thank you. Richard Galanti : I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but generally speaking, in Asia, whether it's Korea, Taiwan, Japan or China, we'll open a new unit including the 10 or 12 weeks of sign-ups prior to opening, with anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 new members. We had a couple of extremes like when we first opened in Shanghai Minhang of well over 200. Now, some of that looky-loos that don't renew and we usually in that first year of renewal and those types of outsized numbers, we might be as low as the mid-to-high 50s and it takes a few years to get even to the mid-70s. But we see those numbers overall continue to increase every year and I don't - I can't - I don't - I actually probably go back to what it was in the first 10 years of our 40-year history with even the U.S. My guess, it wasn't that extreme, but we didn't have as many - it wasn't national and local news events, the day we opened. We had a lot of people coming into some of these markets that are signing up that may be live too far away or choose not to come back. So we're seeing that continuing to grow. So by - even as simple - that's slight 0.1% decline, it's round the year in the sense that you opened up a couple of more units a year ago, they've just renewing for the first time that increases that number. Peter Benedict : Yes. No, understood. Last one, I think I heard you say, mid-to-high 20s in terms of unit opening plan for fiscal '24. Can you give us a sense how many of those are in the U.S. and then how many would be international? Thank you. Richard Galanti : 70% plus in the U.S. and Canada, mostly U.S., of course. Peter Benedict : Got it. Richard Galanti : Which in my view is we're finding more openings - more opportunities in the U.S. to in-fill, given our high volumes. And we got plenty going on over the years, overseas. Peter Benedict : Yes. Thanks so much, Richard. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Erica Eiler : Good afternoon. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our questions. So I guess first, I was hoping maybe you could give us a quick download, maybe on how you're feeling about the health of your consumer right now? I mean, obviously some concerns out there on student loan impact starting to roll in here, those restarts. So maybe any color you can provide on how you're thinking about discretionary from here, maybe some of those concerns out there? Anything on trade down or private-label, anything of note on that front in terms of consumer behavior as well? Richard Galanti : Right, well, look, first of all, first and foremost, our traffic continues to do very well. Being up continually 4% to 5% on a year-over-year basis is great. And our renewal rates continue to be very strong. So that's the starting point. It makes sense to us on big-ticket discretionary that's where you'd see the biggest weakness. We see some of that in some areas going back. When we look at our numbers compared to MBD, that tells us where we are versus our competitors. Overall, not in every category, but overall we tend to do better. So even a negative number here is a lower negative number elsewhere. So - and again, what do we do, we brought in some smaller ticket items that are impulse snack items to get an extra partial item in everybody's basket. So, yes and newness, bringing those new items. And there's not been a whole lot in television. Our unit sales and TVs are pretty good, but the average price point has come down, as they do anyway, there's always deflationary. When you don't have new technology yet and that's just, we haven't seen a whole lot of new stuff yet there. Gaming is good right now and Christmas is good. I mean, we're one of the - not the only one, but one of the few that are bringing in seasonal items early, everything from decor to trees, to toys, that's starting off well so far. But it's new, it's in the last few weeks. Erica Eiler : Okay, that's really helpful. And then just - go ahead. Richard Galanti : I'm sorry, what else did you ask? Erica Eiler : And then just shifting gears, so, I just wanted to touch on Retail Media. So obviously a significant focus on driving retail media at some of your peers. So just curious if you could maybe talk a little bit about what Costco is doing in this area and the bigger opportunities that your team sees here? Richard Galanti : Well, part of that is some of the things we're doing with digital and mobile and the app. And we're not giving out quantifiable numbers, but certainly, some of our competitors are talking about doubling these numbers in the next two or three years. In my view, there is some low-hanging fruit out there and we're actively working on it. We've hired a couple of people that are helping us with that as well and more to come. Erica Eiler : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Brandon Cheatham : Hi, everyone. This Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. I just wanted to - when you look at the retail landscape, I was wondering, how did your wages compare to your competition? Are you seeing similar trends in inflation pressure on the wage front and anything that you can help us with, what your plans are over the next couple of quarters? Richard Galanti : Well. First of all, we've always prided ourselves in providing the best hourly wage package out there, wages, benefits, contributions to 401(k). I'm using U.S. numbers here, but our average U.S. - 90% of our employees like many big retailers are hourly. And our average hourly wage is approaching $26 is in the high-$25s. That's on top of a very rich healthcare plan, where the employee only pays around 11% or 12% of it I believe. And on top, little less than that - and on-top of that, irrespective of what employee contributes to his or her 401(k), we contribute anywhere from 3% to 9% based on years of service. So you've got a 20-year cashier making on a full-time basis in the mid-60s with another $4,000 or $5,000 being contributed to his or her 401(k) plan with a very rich healthcare plan. So we stand apart in our view compared to anybody. Our pressure is that, it comes from ourselves. In the last few years, as there have been wage pressure, starting with the frontline workers during the beginning of COVID, we like many retailers added a 2% premium - $2 premium rather. We kept it longer to our knowledge than most anybody for a full year and at the end, we kept a dollar in there. And since then we've had at least three or four increases on top of the normal top-of-scale increase that we do every - generally have done every year - we have done every year. So we'll - in our view, the pressure comes from us and we feel that we're way ahead of our competition in that regard. Brandon Cheatham : Got it. That's helpful, thanks. And I think you mentioned the next iteration of the app, you're going to be able to scan barcodes. Is the idea that eventually the customer are going to be able to scan and go and how could that help flow operations in your stores, if that is the case? Richard Galanti : I don't think we're prepared for Scan and Go, yet. We're just going to scan, but they can't go. So at the end of the day, the first order of business is getting the merchandise on there and haven't had numbers that where a member, he goes online to say, hey, you can also get this currently at your local location. So knowing what's in store when somebody wants to come out, I think that's going to be a big positive to start with and part of the scan is to be able to get more product information on the item as well. Brandon Cheatham : Sure, that makes sense. Okay, I appreciate it. Good luck. Operator : We'll take our next question from Greg Melich with Evercore. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. I have two questions, Richard. First, I'd love an update given the volatility in gas prices last year and a half is to, where we are on penny profit? I know it has improved a lot, but I'm curious it came back down in the last 12 months or if it's sort of stabilized at that higher level? Richard Galanti : Well, we don't give specific numbers. Gas has been stronger for us and we believe all retailers in the last few years. In fact, it was Q4 last year, which I think it was our strongest quarter, recognizing it's 16-week quarter. This fourth quarter, it was still strong, down from its strongest a year earlier on a weekly basis, but nonetheless quite strong. And so it's part of the profit picture currently of all big retailers that sell gas, the supermarkets, the Walmarts and the Costcos of the world. So it's still a profitable business. It's - our view has been, you used to be when prices - given that the return it so fast, literally almost daily, when profits are going up - I'm sorry, when the price of gas is going up, the guy down the street is turning it every eight or nine days is paying a little less four days ago. And so we're making it the less, when sales went down - gallons - the price per gallon went down, we made a little more. I think that equation, while it's still true, is not the driver of the bottom line of gas. Everybody seems to be wanting to make more on gas, which allows us in our view to make a little more and still be even more profitable. We've seen our competitive spread versus our direct competitors at every location on average improve over the last couple of years to now be in the - I want to say to 30-set range per gallon, mid-30s is the average, which is up. It's an average and it can range from 10 to 45. But at the end of the day, we feel good about our competitive position, it's increased and we're still quite profitable down a little bit from a year ago, but nonetheless quite profitable. Greg Melich : That's helpful, thanks. And then my follow up is on cash. I think you finished with $13.7 billion. I think the last time you got to 2013 was when you had a special dividend in 2020. What are your thoughts on how much cash you need or want? And especially now that there is a positive interest rate on holding cash, because that would make you more interested in keeping it, than you pay more tax, just how do you think about? Richard Galanti : Well, I think, look, at the end of day, we've done four special dividends in the past. It's part of our DNA. At some point, we may do that again. Again somewhat like the answer to the other question about membership fees, it's probably a question of when, not if, but we'll let you know. Certainly with earning 5%-ish on that money instead of a clear percent-ish on that money, does make it a little harder to do. But we're not selling the kind of earnings multiple, but we earn 5% on our assets. So, at some point, we'll do something and we'll have to wait and see. Greg Melich : Got it. Thanks and good luck. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Hi, thanks for taking our question, Richard. Just wanted to ask, I think I've asked this many, many times, but it seems like another huge quarter for executive membership growth of almost 1 million more this quarter. And just curious if you could talk about the profile of that member today that's either upgrading or starting out as an executive? What's the characteristics of that customer? And any changes in how that executive member spends in their first year in that upgrade, compared to the prior years? Richard Galanti : I was joking you're going to say, first of all, they are very smart to be an executive member. Look, I think we are over the time, we've done a better job of communicating the value of the executive member. So, we clearly get more people to sign up that way in advance and we see that over time a regular member over the first few years will buy more every year and executive members start at a higher level and will buy more every year from that higher level. So that's really the profile that we've seen. I don't have any specifics on how old the member is. I know that when we look at age characteristics of new members, we're still - everybody used to be concerned 10 years ago, how we going to get millennials when we have an older average customer and all that and we did with things, with items, with things like organic. We're doing the same thing now. We're still getting whether it's Gen Z or Gen A or whatever the next is, we're getting our share of those new members when we look at the profile of our members. Kelly Bania : Thanks, and Richard, I may have missed this, but did you quantify the extra week impact in terms of EBIT or EPS or anything for us? Richard Galanti : No, it's - I mean, the simple math would just say it's 16, 17 of our quarter is equal to a 16-week quarter. That's about as good as we can do. Kelly Bania : Okay. Thank you. Richard Galanti : I think that particularly on net income it takes the 16% or whatever percent number down to 9% or something, and that's just simple math. Kelly Bania : Perfect. Operator : Okay. We'll take our next question from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Oliver Chen : Hi, Richard, inventories being well-positioned, what are your thoughts about where they are now and versus - and also how we will model them going forward relative to sales? And then as we look at overall, ticket trending negative, that compare starts to ease. So does that imply that one flexion on partly the nature of the ticket comparisons overall? The same question is for e-commerce, as you anniversary some of the headwinds, can we expect the comparison to help as well? Thanks a lot, Richard. Richard Galanti : Sure. Inventories, as I mentioned, we feel - the merchants feel very good about our inventory levels right now. Are there a few departments are higher than they want, a few that need a little bit more sure. But overall, they're very good. Look at our fiscal year and inventories stood at just under $16.7 billion and payables stood at $17.5 billion. So I think this - running above 100% on that simple ratio is something new. We used to be - we used to enjoy running 90% to 95%, it fluctuates, but overall, we feel good about our inventories, where they are now. And in terms of supply chain, things coming in on time, we feel good about that as well. Now as it relates to - as we, excuse me, as we anniversary the inflection of when we saw some weakness, I think a couple of quarters ago, I mentioned that will help your big-ticket sales, I said, well, at least in a few several more months we'll anniversary this weakness. So certainly that's going to help. I would like to think that not just that thing that's going to help, but - and the same would be commerce. I mean, we're - again one bright spot in this virtually all e-commerce, not nearly always - is nearly always e-commerce was the appliances that - and I think we've done a better job also of showing the value of these items online, not just the price the item within our case includes delivery and warranty and things like that more so than some of our competitors. And showing great value there. Oliver Chen : Okay. Thanks, Richard. Just a couple of short ones, would love any thoughts on Instacart. It seems like it's a great partnership that you've had for a while. Also another question we have is, EV charging play a role and how you're thinking about future services for customers? Finally, China, any - it's a smaller percentage of total, but it's an important market for the long-term. I mean lots happening there. Has anything changed the value proposition or the geopolitics? Thanks. Richard Galanti : Okay. Yes. I had the second and third, what was the first question? Oh, Instacart, I know they just went public. So we've gotten a lot of questions. At the end of the day, we were good partner with them, they were good partner for us. We used them throughout the U.S. and Canada. And as sales are growing, we've added over the last - during COVID, we added some non-food items that still can be carried in the car, if you will. And we're doing, I think prescriptions with them now. And so, no, it's - a good relationship and it has been for a while. Yes, I might add, though that with regard to those sales, we include that in our warehouse sales, not our e-commerce sales, because it's their employee or their employee coming into Costco to shop, purchase at the register and then take it to the customer. So that's not in our mobile e-commerce sales. As it relates to EV charging, we're testing it in a number of locations. Not a whole lot to be said. If there is a charge for it, it's going to be less Costco and we'll wait and see. And then as it relates to China, no, we just opened a few weeks ago, our fifth location. We have two more planned this fiscal year, both in the - I think one in Shenzhen in early calendar '24 and one other one before the end of August. So we'll have seven locations, up from two, a year and a half ago. And so far, our openings there have treated us well overall. Oliver Chen : Thank you. Best regards. Operator : We'll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Scot Ciccarelli : Good evening, guys. Can you help us understand a bit better how the Costco Next process works? I mean, is it similar to how your e-commerce business used to work, where products were essentially drop-shipped from their vendors? And if that's the case, Richard, how do you control the quality of the product and delivery process, because I thought that became an issue for you guys before you took over your own distribution for e-com? Richard Galanti : Yes, Costco Next is drop-shipped. We curate the items with these suppliers. And for the most part pretty well-known brands. And so far we have not had an issue on that, recognizing it's - they tend to be items that are easily shipped to home. Yes, we're doing - we have all the tracking information as well. So all I can tell you is, you're right about that, that's a good point. Years ago when we did this, there was a difference, but so far it's worked quite well for us. We've had very few customer issues as it relates to items purchased on costco.com on costconext.com. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Understood. Thank you. And then another inflation question, if we do wind up getting outright deflation outside of improved traffic or unit block, are there ways to protect margin because it seems to me like that could wind up being a deflator to the margin, if we're in a deflationary environment there? Richard Galanti : Well, yes that's what our business is about, where we'll take a 10-pack and make it a 12-pack, I guess. But at the end of the day, if there's is inflation, it will impact all of us, but again. I think it should be favorable with us because we will show the best value - we'll still show the best value out there. Scot Ciccarelli : Understood. Thank you. Richard Galanti : Before you do it, another comment was made in the table here, that if there is deflation and disinflation, we've got a $450 million and $500 million LIFO reserve, that'll be - on a reported basis will be part of a tailwind of disinflation. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Scott Mushkin : Hi, Richard, thanks for - thanks for taking my question. I don't think we've talked about it, but what's competition like out there, now that we're seeing inflation come down in volumes, particularly for some guys are negative, just wondering if you - what it looks like out there? Richard Galanti : I think, look we've said this for a few years now, our competition with Sam's is the most direct and we've seen improvements in parts of what they do from our perspective. They are tough competitors and so are we, and - but I think they continue to get to improve overtime, as have we. I don't - we don't really see a whole lot of other things. BJ's is why we expect their model and what they do. It's a slightly different model. So there's not as much - there is certainly - when we are competing directly as a membership warehouse club, we're making sure we're sharp on pricing, particularly in fresh and things like that supermarket items. Beyond that, our view is on the non-food side, we are gaining share. As evidenced by the numbers we see in some of these NPD results. And the thing that I just called out on appliances grew like that. Recognizing appliances of whatever a $30 billion business, we're still a small piece of it, but growing rapidly. Scott Mushkin : Thanks. And then, I know it came up earlier about raising membership rates, but I kind of philosophical like this recession, not recession, maybe there will be one, how does the company look at raising the membership fee, if the economy is slow and fast? Does it matter? Does it factor in? Richard Galanti : I think. I think it matters. It does matter and I think it really mattered as we approached kind of the 5.5 years. Post June 17th, we were in the high - the headline every day was inflation and economy. And so, we're doing great. We've got great loyalty. If we wait a little longer, so be it. And that's kind of how we feel right now. So... Scott Mushkin : Okay, great. Thanks, I'll yield. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good evening, Richard. So your core and core margins were up a lot in this quarter. Can you talk about what drove that? I think you mentioned food and sundries, that successful vendor-funded promotions, is there anything one-time in nature about that gain that we shouldn't extrapolate forward? Richard Galanti : Yes, well, aside from LIFO, markdowns were lot less, quarter-on-quarter, so no markdowns. It was a big piece of it, particularly on the non-food side, that helped. Last year we had - it was a year ago that all of us including Costco, I think our inventories on a year-over-year basis were up 26% for two quarters in a row. And, of course, those will come down and so that was probably the biggest single thing in those numbers. And the comment that was made at the table here, we're back on track on seasonal in and out dates. So we're not having - a year - it was a year, year and a half ago where certain seasonal items came in late and just to move them out, not to have to store as much, some we did store, but to move them out where we felt that was the best way to do it, we take extra markdowns. So that helped. Chris Horvers : And then a follow-up question around the consumer, you just came through the back-to-school season. There are some important electronics categories that are a big part of the basket during that time of year that also become a big part of the basket around holidays. Are you seeing, iPads and PCs and notebooks? Are you seeing positive unit trends and how does that make you feel about the upcoming holiday season? Richard Galanti : Gaming is up, some of the Apple products are up, TV units are up, but again, the average price points have come down some. Tablets are up and audio is up a little. Chris Horvers : But not notebooks and computers? Richard Galanti : No. Chris Horvers : Got it. Thanks. Richard Galanti : Let's down was the answer yet. Chris Horvers : Understood. Thanks so much. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. John Heinbockel : So Richard, first thing, maybe just talk about how you look at cannibalization versus expanding the market in the U.S., right? And if you - obviously, you can now put - it looks like locations closer together. When you kind of look at the U.S. in total, is there a number, right, that you guys have in mind that's now possible, given what you're doing with density? Richard Galanti : Yes, our view is over the next 10 years that we could add easily another 150 and that's on top of however many business centers, call it, but just in the U.S. So - and that number keeps changing. If you had asked me six or eight years ago, where we'd be today, I would say, if we were 70/30 U.S. back then, we'd be 50/50 by now, outside of the - will be 50. And today, we're at 65, 70 in the U.S. So, we're finding more opportunities here and it's evidenced by just the sheer volumes of the units - that our units are doing today versus three or four years ago. It's much higher than we would have expected three or four years ago. So we think that there is still a lot of runway in that regard. John Heinbockel : And then just a quick follow-up, I know you guys haven't been particularly interested in BOPIS, right for cost reasons and I assume that's still the case. There's a consumer argument for it, but - I think it's hard to make the cost side of it work, is that still your view? Richard Galanti : That is still our view overall. In addition to the thing I mentioned a little bit with what we're doing with Instacart on non-food items as well. We are testing in-store some big-ticket items like TVs, but on a limited basis to see what happens for Buy Online and Pickup in Store. John Heinbockel : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll take our last question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joe Feldman : Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the CPG guys, are they funding promotions a little more regularly with you guys? I know you did something, I think with P&G that seems like a clever promotion to get a gift card back from them, it seemed. And I'm just wondering what you're seeing across the other vendors? Richard Galanti : Yes. Well the CPG, actually we did that last year as well, done it for a couple of years. We will say, we'll do it again. It's growing. So, and once we do that with one, we want to share that excitement with others to see what other types of things we can drive that way. So I'd say there's probably a little bit more increase on that type of promotional things. And then inventory is available for those things. We could really drive sales of those items in a short period of time. Joe Feldman : Right, that makes sense. They have the volume and you guys do. And then are you guys approaching the holiday any different this year? I know you mentioned Christmas goods are off to a good start, but is that - earlier than normal? I feel like you are about the same timing, but maybe you could share thoughts on the approach to the holiday season. Richard Galanti : Yes, if it's earlier, it's a week or two earlier. And some things came in early, and yes, it's a little early compared to some of the supply-chain disruptions we had, which screwed up a lot of things. But if you go back to where we were before COVID, we're probably at or very slightly earlier. And in terms of how we're approaching it? We're approaching it aggressively in terms of having stuff to sell to the members. But we want to be - we want to be out to. Typically this is nothing different here, even on things like toys will bring in a few things in the last couple of weeks before Christmas, that if they don't sell through, we're not at risk of having to mark them down dramatically because they're not unique just to Christmas. Joe Feldman : Understood. No, that's great. Thanks, guys and good luck this quarter, Richard. Richard Galanti : Well, thank you, everyone. We're around to answer questions. And have a good holiday and we'll talk to you soon. Operator : And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Comparable sales and comparable sales excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. In today's release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal '24, the 12 weeks ended November 26. Reported net income for the 12-week first quarter came in at $1.589 billion or $3.58 per share, up from $1.364 billion or $3.07 per share in the 12-week first quarter last year. This year's results included a tax benefit of $44 million or $0.10 a share related to stock-based compensation. Last year's results included a tax benefit of $53 million or $0.12 per share related to stock-based compensation and also included a charge of $93 million pre-tax or $0.15 per share primarily related to downsizing our charter shipping activities. Net sales for the first quarter were $56.72 billion, a 6.1% increase over last year's first quarter, $53.44 billion. Net sales were benefited by approximately 0.5% (ph) to 1% in the U.S. and worldwide from the shift of the fiscal calendar as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year-over-year and comparable retail weeks. In the U.S. reported 2% comp sales ex-gas deflation and FX 2.6%. Canada reported 6.4%, ex-gas and FX 8.2%. Other International reported 11.2%, ex-gas and FX 7.1%. For total company reported 3.8% and at 3.9%, excluding those two items. E-commerce, which was reported as a 6.3% came in at 6.1% excluding FX. Overall, for the first fiscal quarter, fresh foods were relatively strong once again, with food and sundries right behind. Non-food showed improvement over the September October, November time frame as did e-com sales. In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 4.7% worldwide and 3.6% in the United States. Our average transaction was down 0.9% worldwide and down 1.6% in the U.S. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted sales by approximately 0.4%, while gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.6%. I've gotten more than a few calls in the past few weeks as to how many pies we sold in the U.S. leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday. In the U.S., in the three days leading up to Thanksgiving, we sold 2.9 million of our famous Pumpkin Pies along with 1.3 million apple and pecan pies, so over 4 million pies in total during the three days. Back to the income statement here and next on the income statement's membership fee income. In the quarter, we reported $1.082 billion or 1.91%, that's an $82 million or 8.2% increase and a 4 basis point increase over the first quarter last year. In terms of renewal rates, at first quarter end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate stood at 92.8%, while the worldwide rate came in at 90.5%. Both of these rates were up 0.1% from those numbers 12 weeks earlier at the end of the fourth quarter. Membership growth continues. We ended Q1 with 72.0 million paid household members, up 7.6% versus last year and 129.5 million cardholders, up 7.1%, with consistent growth throughout the quarters. At Q1 end, we had 33.2 million paid Executive members, an increase of 939,000 during the 12 weeks since Q4 end. Executive members now represent a little over 46% of our paid members and a little over 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement next is, our gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was higher year-over-year by 43 basis points, coming in at 11.04%, up from Q1 of last year at 10.61%. That 43 basis point reported number ex-gas deflation would be plus 36 basis points. As I normally do here, we write down two columns and six line items. The first column is reported in the first quarter. The second column is margins, excluding gas deflation. It's the year-over-year change in the first quarter. On a core merchandise, plus 3 basis points reported, minus 3 basis points ex-deflation. Ancillary and other businesses, plus 24% reported and plus 22% ex-gas deflation; 2% reward lower year-over-year, minus 4 basis points reported and minus 3 ex-gas deflation; LIFO, plus 3 and plus 3 and other plus 17 and plus 17 for a total, again, reported year-over-year up 43 basis points and ex-gas deflation up 36 basis points. Starting with the core. Again, it was total company, it was plus 3 and minus 3 reported and ex-gas deflation. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were up by 5 basis points year-over-year. Ancillary and other business gross margin, again, higher by 24 and higher by 22 ex-gas deflation. This increase was driven largely by gas and e-comm. Our 2% reward higher by 4 and higher by 3 ex-deflation, reflecting higher sales penetration coming from our Executive members. LIFO plus 3 basis points. We had a $15 million LIFO credit in the first quarter of this year. This compared to a very small $0.5 million LIFO charge in Q1 a year ago. And then, the other line item, the 17 basis points to the positive. As was mentioned earlier, last year in Q1, there was a 17 basis point impact from a $93 million pre-tax charge, primarily related -- primarily for the downsizing of our charter shipping activities. Moving on to SG&A. We reported SG&A of 9.45%, higher by 25 basis points than last year's 9.20%. Again, in Q1, we're right down the two columns. Reported and without gas deflation, operations, minus 18 and minus 14 basis points, minus being -- meaning it's higher year-over-year. Central minus 2 and minus 1. Stock compensation minus 3 and minus 2. Pre-opening expense, minus 2 and minus 2, again, for a total reported margin higher minus 25% year-over-year. I'm sorry, SG&A, not margin, 25 and without gas deflation, higher by 19 basis points. The quarter again was higher by 18 and higher by 14, excluding the impact from gas. This included 12 weeks of this past March's extra top of scale increase in our wages, which represents an estimated 2 basis point hit. And as of September 18, we raised the starting wage in the U.S. and Canada, that estimated impact from those new wages to be roughly 2 basis points as well. Again, central, nothing much to say other than its 1 basis point higher, excluding gas deflation. Again, it was stock comp's, the minus 2x gas deflation and pre-opening. We did have a couple of more openings this year in the quarter than we did last year and that was higher by 2 basis points. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $38 million this year, $4 million higher than last year's $34 million figure. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $107 million, coming in at $160 million this year versus $53 million last year. This was driven largely by the increase in interest income, about $100 million of that $107 million due to higher interest rates as well as high cash balances. The small additional impact was a favorable FX year-over-year. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter was 24.5%. This compares to 23.0% a year ago or 1.5 percentage points higher this year than last year. The increase in our rate as of Q1 -- in Q1 is primarily attributable to lower benefit from the stock-based compensation from a year ago. Overall, reported net income was up 16.5% year-over-year in the quarter. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion in the first quarter, we opened 10 locations, including one relo (ph), so a net of nine increases. That -- those nine included eight in the U.S. and one in Canada. For the full year fiscal '24, we estimate opening -- we're planning to open 33 locations, including two relos, so for a net increase of 31 new warehouses that would be up from 23 that we opened in fiscal '23. For Q2 fiscal '24, we plan four new locations, including our sixth building in China, are early in the calendar year. Regarding capital expenditures, first quarter capital expenditure spend was approximately $1.04 billion. We estimate that fiscal '24 CapEx will be in the $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion range, that's up from $4.3 billion we had in fiscal '23, reflecting a continued increase in the number of the expansion that we're doing. In terms of e-commerce business, e-com sales in Q1 ex-FX increased 6.1%, the first quarterly year-over-year increase in five fiscal quarters and trended well during the three reporting periods of September, October, November. E-comm showed strength in several areas. In food, things like e-gift cards, pet items, snack items were up in the mid-teens. Appliances were up year-over-year in the mid-20s. TVs was actually in the high-singles despite the challenges with other aspects of consumer electronics like computers, and tires were up in the low-teens. So overall, a pretty good showing there. As well, Costco Logistics enjoyed record-breaking deliveries. In the first quarter of fiscal '24, we completed over 800,000 deliveries, which were up 17% versus the comparable quarter last year. And some fun wow items in the quarter in e-commerce. You've probably read about the fact that we're selling gold 1 ounce gold bars. We sold over $100 million of gold during the quarter. We sold a Babe Ruth autographed index card for $20,000. And in addition to e-gift cards on everything from restaurants to golf to airlines, and we just in the last couple of weeks, launched a Disney e-gift card valued at $250 for $224.99. And for you last-minute shoppers out there, there is a Mickey Mantle autographed 1951 Rookie Card in nearly perfect condition and it's on sale online for $250,000. Next, good progress continues to be made with our e-com mobile and digital efforts. No big enhancements and changes to the site leading up to the holiday, mostly holiday prep. We did have 100% site availability during Cyber week, and sales for the five Cyber Days, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Cyber Monday were up year-over-year in the mid-teens. Our app downloads during the quarter were 2.75 million, so total app downloads are now stand at 30.5 million or a 10% increase during the quarter, and that's after up being over 40% increase in all of fiscal '23 versus the prior year. Our site traffic approaching 0.5 billion and just under 10% increase and the average order value being up about 2.5%. So we continue to make progress there. Next couple of comments regarding inflation, most recently in the last fourth quarter discussion. We had estimated that year-over-year inflation was in the 1% to 2% range. Our estimate for the quarter just ended, that inflation was in the 0% to 1% range. Bigger deflation in some big and bulky items like furniture sets due to lower freight costs year-over-year as well as on things like domestics, bulky, lower priced items again, where the freight cost is significant. Some deflationary items were as much as 20% to 30% and again, mostly freight-related. TVs, the average sale prices have been lower while unit's been higher. And talking to the buyers overall, our inventories and our SKU counts are in good shape across all channels. And so far, we've had a good seasonal sell-through during the quarter. Lastly, as you saw in this afternoon's press release, we declared a $15 per share special cash dividend. This is our fifth special dividend in 11 years. The total payout will be about just under $6.7 billion and will be funded using existing cash and not accompanied by any issuance of debt. The special cash dividend will be paid on January 12th to shareholders of record on December 28th. Finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, December 31, on Thursday, January 4th, after market close. With that, I will turn it back for Q&A to Lisa and be happy to answer any questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. You had indicated over the last 1.5 years or so that Costco had been raising prices faster than it had throughout its history. So now with prices coming down, what is going to be the posture on passing along those savings? You already noted that inflation is flat to up 1%. So do you expect deflation, especially on the food side as you get through the next couple of quarters? Richard Galanti : Well, talking to buyers, we've seen that even during the quarter, we saw a trend towards that 0% versus the 1%. But at the end of the day, we don't -- the buyers are looking out three to six months. They have -- on the fresh food side, commodities-wise, they haven't seen a lot. There are a few things that are up and a few things are down, but no giant trend either way. Look, as you know us for a long time, we want to be the first to lower prices. We're out there pressing our vendors as we seek different commodity components come down and certainly on the non-food side, as we saw shipping costs come down, things like that. And so probably a little more than less, but we'll have to wait and see. We don't know. Michael Lasser : And my follow-up is another point that you've made for a long time is that Costco's going to draft off the profitability of the broader retail sector. If you compare Costco's operating margin over the last 12 months versus where it was prior to the pandemic, it's 300 to 400 basis points higher. And yet, across retail, there are signs that profitability is coming down. So now, what we've seen in the ways of Costco either maintaining this existing rate of operating profit margin or even further growing it from here, so it just simply going to be a function of your ability to drive further sales growth in the -- consistently mid-single digit range or better. Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, happily, I'm able to say that, that's -- you get to figure that one out. At the end of the day, we're -- as you've known for a long time, we're a top line company, we want to drive sales. Certainly, as there's been deflation in certain products, we've seen units go up. I'm looking at one example here just in the last month, $100 million plus of KS net items where sales were flat to down a couple percent, while units were up in the mid-teens, that takes a little more labor to do. But at the end of the day, that's what we want to do. We want to drive people and frequency. I think as long as we see renewal rates continue to do what they do, as long as we see new sign-ups continue to what they do and hopefully continue to get people to convert to Executive as well and constantly driving the best value out there, we'll be in good stead. And so far, we've been able to do that and I think we'll continue to be able to do that. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much and have a good holiday. Richard Galanti : You too. Operator : We'll take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Jacquelyn Sussman : Hi, there. This is Jackie Sussman on for Simeon. Thank you so much for taking our question. The core and core margin was up modestly this quarter and it seems like it moderated sequentially. Looking forward to the balance of the year, it seems like the comparison gets a bit tougher. I guess how should we think about your core and core margin? Could it stay expanding and positive for the rest of the year or any color on that would be helpful. Thank you so much. Richard Galanti : There are so many different moving parts to it. As you've heard me say and I say in the last several years, we want to drive top line first. We're also pragmatic. We want -- we recognize we're a for-profit company and we'll continue to work hard to do both. I wouldn't read much into any number going up a little or down a little, frankly. It fluctuates and there's lots of different components to it. Jacquelyn Sussman : Got you. Thanks so much. And just a quick follow-up. Was the Black Friday and Cyber Monday gains that you had better than what you were expecting internally? Thanks so much. Richard Galanti : They\u2019re a little better than we were expecting but we were ready for it. Jacquelyn Sussman : Thanks so much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Charles Grom : Hey. How is it going Richard? Good afternoon. I wanted to just dive into the core margins a little bit more and see if you could flesh out some of the category color. If you said it, I missed it, but food, sundries, fresh and on the hardlines parts of the business. Richard Galanti : Well, without giving you specific basis points, food and sundries was slightly down, very slightly down. Non-food was actually up. Some of that relates to the fact that we are comparing against last year when we had higher freight costs and trying to drive business and fresh was down a little bit. So nothing Earth-shattering in either of those directions. Charles Grom : Okay. And then on the ancillary up 22 basis points, I think we all get the gas component. But can you just talk about why the e-commerce margins were so much better in the quarter? Richard Galanti : I think, well, first of all, part of just ancillary in general is a sales penetration issue. Without going into it that the fact that it showed more -- sometimes when you look back over the quarters, they go in opposite directions, the core on core and then the other businesses. And so given that you had higher sales penetration in both and e-com, that helped you, and e-com, we had a lot of strength. We're doing a lot of big and bulky and we're driving that business. Charles Grom : Okay. Great. And then just bigger picture, I just have a question on the change at the CEO seat with Ron starting in a few weeks and replacing Craig, who replaced Jim. You've had the fortunate opportunity to work with all three. And I guess I'm curious what change, if any, you think we could see from an operating standpoint moving forward? Richard Galanti : Yeah. Well, I always joke I'm up for review so I'm going to say nice things. But at the end of the day, the reality is, we're staying the course. I remember questions were asked 12-plus years ago when Craig became President, and two years later, Jim retired and Craig became CEO and President. And what's -- who can replace Jim? And I think the same questions asked today, who could replace Greg? And it really is a seamless transition. You have somebody retiring that's been here 40-ish years and it's been in the business both on operations and merchandising for a successful number of years in both. And you've got Ron who's coming in, who started when he was 17 at a Price Club in Arizona. And he already has his 40-year gold patch. And again, 30-ish years in operations, a year in real estate traveling in the world and then six or seven years in merchandising. So I think it is pretty seamless. And to see them, the two of them work together over the last two years, almost two years since Ron became President, it's very similar to what I saw during those two years when Craig became President, and then two years later, Jim retired and Craig took on the CEO role as well. And so that's pretty much steady as she goes. Charles Grom : Got you. Great. Happy holidays. Thanks. Richard Galanti : Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Scott Mushkin : Hey, Richard. I guess, I just wanted to think about the potential clubs in the U.S. I know it comes up sometimes, but obviously, you added eight. It just seems like there's maybe more runway you can hear in the U.S. And I wonder if you have any thoughts on that. And then I had a quick follow-up. Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, if we were to open the 31 this year, that would be somewhere in the low 20s, the 23, 24 in the U.S. And I recognize a few of those are business centers, which is we continue to add as well as regular -- most of the regular warehouses. And I would say that, yes, I guess the story I'd share with you is six or eight years ago when it was roughly 60-40 or 70-30 U.S.-Canada versus the international -- other international. We were asked, what would it be by today? I'd say, well, by today, it will be 50-50. Well, today, you're asking the same question, it's 60-40 or 70-30 today, what will it be? And I think it will trend that way over time, but we are finding more opportunities in the U.S. Clearly, our average sales volume per location is higher today than we would have expected ourselves thankfully, six, seven years ago, what would it be by now. And we are finding those opportunities. So I view that as good news. We still -- we've got a lot of things going on to drive International, but International will be 6 or 7 units this year. And then opportunity to grow last year, international was -- is 9 or 10 and that's more of a timing issue. Scott Mushkin : So then my follow-up is around traffic and also like the growth you had in appliances and TVs. You're just kind of going in a different direction than a lot of people. So what's driving the share gains in those categories? But also, are you guys doing anything specifically different to drive the traffic numbers you're seeing? Because I mean, they're pretty amazing, given the environment. Richard Galanti : Yeah. Well, look, I've always said I think the biggest attribute of value is the lowest price, given quantity and quality of good or service and then certainly add to that the trust that our members have. I think as it relates to specific things like I pointed out, like appliances and even tires, its value. We -- and the -- and having acquired Interval three or four years ago now called Costco Logistics, we're doing a lot of business there. And I think we've gotten a better job of communicating what the value is, not just showing what the price of the exact item is at some of the other big retail competitors on some of these big items. But then you add in delivery, take away the old product used, the installation, delivery, take away the old product for disposition, it\u2019s significant savings. Go do a price check of some of those things compared to our competition, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll see the strength. Scott Mushkin : Perfect. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. John Heinbockel : So Richard, I'm wondering if one of the things you may do differently here, we've talked about this before is leaning into personalization more and where you are on that journey, particularly with Ron coming in. Richard Galanti : Right. Well, we're -- first to our business was fixing the foundation. We're in the middle of re-platforming our e-commerce. It's not a big bank where we're going to put the switch one day, we're bringing things over and that's in progress. It was, I think I mentioned last -- probably last quarter, it's a two-year road map on that, and we're halfway through that. And so I'd say very little so far. If we're in the second inning, maybe we're in the third inning now. But we -- a lot of the focus has been on, first of all, making sure doing small improvements. We certainly got the -- on the 5 star rating, it got up north of 4.5 on that, and we're getting better at the site every time. But I think you would see personalization and, first of all, targeting and then personalization more over the next couple of years, honestly. And we're fine with that. We're the first to our business getting the foundation right. And we've made a lot of progress. I didn't spend a lot of time on this call talking about the new things, the enhancements we've made to the mobile site and the e-com site, but we've done a lot. John Heinbockel : And maybe as a follow-up, you talked about the international opportunity and it's still very well underdeveloped. So what's the hindrance to getting to -- because you're in a lot of countries now, 15 to 20 annual openings, maybe that's a big ask. But is it just quality of real estate because I would imagine operationally, it's not a human resource issue. Is it purely a real estate issue? Richard Galanti : I would say it's a combination of issues. In some countries, I mean, if you look at Korea, Taiwan, where we have whatever, 15 or 16 locations in each country, very successful. It's a little harder to find the next location just from a real estate standpoint. We -- if you look in Japan where we have plenty of future opportunity, we've got 30-plus now. And -- but again, it's a little bit of real estate. If you look at places like China or Spain, one of the challenges is you want -- you like to be able to ideally bring over more than a handful of people from the existing locations in the new one. It's a very hands-on operation. I think one of the things that we felt we mentioned that we had success when we first opened our first unit in Shanghai is we had at least 60, 70 people move there from Taiwan for promotions and for interactions, not just in the office and the buying offices, but even in the key supervisor and manager positions within the warehouse. And so it takes a little longer. And -- but we're working hard at it but it's a very hands-on experience. John Heinbockel : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Hello, Richard. Thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to kind of follow up on Scot's question. I think your average sales per club in the U.S. and Canada is around $300 million at this point. And just curious on the status of how many clubs are doing kind of well over that and are maybe in some need of relief in the form of self-cannibalization and more clubs nearby. And a follow-up as well on International. Just as we think about the next maybe three to five years, are there any countries that might be disproportionately getting more of the growth here? Richard Galanti : Okay. What was the first part of the question, again? Unidentified Company Representative : The average sales. Richard Galanti : Average sales. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I know in fiscal '23, we had something like 25 or so locations that did over $400 million and another 160 or so that did $300 million to $400 million. Those are huge numbers. And certainly, as we get 350-plus and one of them, by the way, they did over 400 did a few million over $600 million. And so generally, when it starts getting -- when it starts having a three in front of it, certainly at $350 million, we want to start looking to see what we can do to cannibalize it, frankly, and to have more growth in that market. And so hopefully, that's our -- one of our bigger problems and challenges that we have more of those each year. So I think that will continue. Again, if I look back five, eight years ago, even assuming whatever inflation number you want to assume, I think we've done a little better than that in terms of the sales volumes. And so that's good news for us that we'll continue to do that. Internationally, again, I'm just looking at the map of where we are. Certainly, we only have four locations in Spain. We've actually added a few on a base of 30-plus in the U.K. We think we have more opportunity in Mexico. In Japan, where we have something in the low 30s, certainly, it's done well there, and there's many more markets and population there that we can go to. Australia is, whatever two-thirds -- a little under two-thirds of the size of Canada where we have 105 or so locations. And in Australia, we have 15. I'm not suggesting we're going to have two-thirds of 105 there anytime soon. It takes us 35-plus years to get there in Canada. But we think that those are the opportunities. It's not like we're looking for a lot of other new countries at this juncture. We've done a few new countries, those single locations like in Sweden and Iceland and Auckland all being somewhat managed buying wise somewhat operationally by host country in the case of Scandinavia by the U.K., in the case of Auckland by Australia. Kelly Bania : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Scot Ciccarelli : Good afternoon, guys. So Richard, last quarter, you talked a bit about Costco Next. And I guess my question is, how big of an impact is that program having on your e-com sales at this point, number one? Number two, kind of related to that, any change in your betting of what vendors operate on that program, just thinking about the quality control aspect? Thank you. Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, it's still very small relative to our company. And the fact is, is that the Costco net sales currently are not in our sales. It's -- we got to commission, so it's kind of like 3P, if you will, 3P sales. And at some juncture, some of their rules -- accounting rules where you can include it in sales based on what risk and what ownership level you have in the items. But at this juncture, those sales, it's more of the market value and just the commission in our number. In terms of how we vet, we do it the same way we vet items. We want items that make sense to provide value, and we have a team that is here that are vetting every -- each and every one of those. I think we're up to about 70 -- about 65 current suppliers on there and we'll certainly have many more as we go forward. Scot Ciccarelli : So presumably, if that program keeps growing, should that be a natural gross margin driver for you over time? I know it's small now, but if you're just collecting the commission, presumably that's kind of 100% margin, right? Richard Galanti : Essentially, yes. Much like the travel business. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Thank you. Unidentified Company Representative : Mostly. Operator : We'll take our next question from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Gregory Melich : Hi, thanks. Richard, I want to follow up on the membership fee hike as I think now we're in extra time. And I wonder how much does the growth in mix and Executive membership driving that high single-digit growth. Is that what it means that you don't have to increase it and you could keep waiting or is there something else? Richard Galanti : I think it's just us. Again, if I look at the -- if you ask the question, what are the variables we would look at, we would want to look at strong renewal rates, strong new sign-ups, strong loyalty, and we have all that. So I think it's a question is, we haven't needed to do it. We like providing extreme value. Certainly, while we've gone a little longer than the average increase, we feel we certainly have driven more value to the membership. So I'll use my standby answer, my answer, it's a question of when, not if. But at this juncture, we feel pretty good about what we're doing. Gregory Melich : And a follow-up on inflation. I just want to make sure I got that right. You said 0% to 1% for the quarter. Did it trend towards 0%? Did we exit near the bottom? And you mentioned some categories that were deflationary, which ones are stubborn in terms of inflation where it's hardest to get it out? Richard Galanti : Which inflation -- which categories are stubborn in inflation? Gregory Melich : Yeah. Where you can\u2019t get that? Richard Galanti : CPG, obviously. Gregory Melich : All the branded packaged stuff? Richard Galanti : There wasn't a big trend. I think at the end, it was a little lower than the beginning, but not a big trend. Gregory Melich : Okay. So it's not like we exited 0%. We're still slightly positive. Richard Galanti : Right. But recognize, the LIFO charge is an inventory cost of sales charge. [Multiple Speakers] Unidentified Company Representative : Year-over-year number. LIFO [Multiple Speakers] Richard Galanti : Right. The 0% to 1% is from the beginning of the fiscal year. Now it's from -- I'm sorry, the beginning of -- the 0% to 1% is versus a year ago. Gregory Melich : Year-over-year, got it. Richard Galanti : Yeah. Gregory Melich : Great. And then just last, what is the auto renewal rate now? Unidentified Company Representative : Around 60%. Richard Galanti : In the U.S., it's around 60%. Gregory Melich : Perfect. Thanks. Have a great holiday guys. Richard Galanti : You too. Operator : We'll take a next question from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So I just want to go to operating expense growth. So operating expense growth is still high. Would you expect the growth rate to moderate once you lap that March wage increase? And then anything unusual within that line item that's still driving pretty high growth? Richard Galanti : There's not a lot unusual. I think it gets back to the question of low inflation, which creates a little bit more of a challenge, right? My extreme -- and again, that was a very extreme example I gave you on nuts. But when you had a slight 0% to 2% decline in sales and a 14% increase in units, you got more labor involved, more hours stock of the shelf. I mean that's at the 40,000-foot level. And that's an extreme example. But I think overall, it is sales base. You should also remember, if you remember going back to fiscal '19 and the first part of fiscal '20, before COVID, our SG&A percent was -- for all of \u201819, it was at 10 04. In the first quarter of 2020, it was a 10 34, And for the whole year, it was a 10 04 for both of those two years. And we used to think to ourselves will we ever be able to get it back below 10%. And in 2022, which was the kind of month seven through 18, if you will, that 12-month period after that full fiscal year for us of COVID, we reported an 8 88 for that year. So even at the 9 45 that we just reported, we're still quite a bit lower than we had been historically, a function of a lot of things, including higher sales productivity and all that. So I think we're doing pretty well. I think certainly, that's the challenge. How do we reduce that and how do we manage that? And certainly, the biggest way to manage is driving more sales. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So just curious how you're feeling about the healthier consumer. So it was interesting to hear that TVs did well this past quarter. Richard Galanti : Look, I think when we're asked that question, we're fortunate to answer it that we're, first of all, looking at the consumer through somewhat rose-colored glasses here. The we have enjoyed great value. And again, we're convinced it's value. We've got -- I think on the margin, there's a few extra things that we've done. We've improved the site of the website. We've gotten a little better communicating stuff, not completely. But I think overall, it's -- and we've been good merchants. I think the merchants have done a great job of bringing in new stuff. And not being shy when we see an industry category down a lot, that we can still -- if we're driving people in, we've got a better chance of getting them to buy something. Rupesh Parikh : Thank you. Happy holidays. Richard Galanti : Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Thomas Nass : Hi. This is Tom Nass on for Oliver. Just a quick question on the trend of Kirkland relative to last year. If you could just remind us how that's trending maybe across categories. And then if you have any notable callouts, any recent innovations? Just curious if this is essentially driving any efficiencies and supplier negotiations that can position Costco for stronger gross margin ahead. Richard Galanti : Well, I would say, allowing us to get better deals, which means lower prices. But look, I think we -- Kirkland signature (ph) relative to non-gas sales is in the high-20s. And I think it was probably a good year ago when inflation was in the 8 and 9 range, if you will, if you remember. And we talked about that year-over-year, we saw probably the biggest increased penetration of KS at Costco. It was 1, 1.5 percentage points, when historically, it has been 25 basis points to 50 basis points a year. I think we're back to that, but we've maintained that higher level and we're back to seeing smaller increases in penetration every year, but nonetheless still driving that business. But we've got -- yeah. I think that helps with some of the deflationary certainly with KS stuff, we're closer to the supplier. We're not the only -- we're the only customer buying that item and we can drive a little bit more business. So I think it just continues to work that way for us. Thomas Nass : Great. And then just a quick follow-up on any notable behavioral trends you've seen in consumer shopping this holiday season? Richard Galanti : Some colleague in my room said they're buying gold. But no, that's actually online mostly. But no, I think -- again, I think the traffic thing is the thing that we're happily surprised about that we're continuing to drive people in on an increasing basis. We know we benefited during those, call it those two years, kind of March, April of '20 to March, April of '22, the kind of the two years of COVID, we benefited in many ways from more members and more volumes. And we\u2019ve not only kept it, we\u2019re continuing now to add to those levels, so we feel very fortunate in that regard. Thomas Nass : Thanks. Richard Galanti : One of my colleagues here just mentioned that discretionary merchandise trends are getting a little better. And that\u2019s not only on big ticket but in general, nonfood stuff. I think that corresponds with my comment earlier that we feel good about the seasonal -- how we\u2019ve done seasonally. Thomas Nass : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Mark Astrachan : Yes. Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. I guess I wanted to ask on the Kirkland products, specifically maybe on the CPG that you mentioned. How has pricing or how has prices trended on those versus the branded products? Have you seen any deviation there, given you're closer? Are you able to lower prices? I suppose to the extent that, that has happened, do you notice any more market share changes within those CPG categories? Richard Galanti : I think it's slightly -- it's deflationary. It's a little more deflationary in the KS than in the CPG, which drives more value to KS, frankly. But we're seeing some -- our ability to work with our CPG suppliers as well, but just a little stronger ability to do that with KS. Mark Astrachan : Got it. Richard Galanti : And it is, again, a comment in the room here. We've had -- it's allowed us to do some new item introductions on the KS side as well. Mark Astrachan : Great. And then just following up on the last question. Anything you can call out amongst the newer memberships cohorts in terms of renewal rates versus the average? Richard Galanti : Generally speaking, if you compare, everybody was always concerned. I remember 10-plus years ago, people would ask you, how are you going after millennials? And then it's how you go after the next gen or whatever, the Gen Zs or whatever? At the end of the day, when we look at the different cohorts, if you just change the names, the curve seems to be about the same in terms of getting new younger members. They buy less, they buy more as they get older into that 40- to 55-year-old sweet spot. I don\u2019t know in terms of renewal rates. I think the rates are \u2013 our overall rates are improving so I think we\u2019re probably doing a better job there. Certainly, things like, frankly, auto renewal helped that as well. Mark Astrachan : Got it. Thank you. Happy holidays. Richard Galanti : Same to you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Corey Tarlowe : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. Richard, you mentioned about the wage increases that you've taken recently. I'm curious to get your thoughts about the wage increases that you've taken within the context of now the lower inflation that you're seeing as well as what could be potential deflation further ahead. So curious about the ability for Costco to maybe maintain a more nimble margin structure amid what could be some volatility on the pricing side. Richard Galanti : Frankly, we look at the wages in a vacuum, and we want to do as much as we can for our employees. And certainly, there were several increases starting with the frontline worker premium during the initial year of COVID. We kept half of that in there, which we kept $1 of those $2 now in there, which was like $400 million a year. Again, we've also benefited from stronger sales and productivity so we're able to afford that. But we look at them independently and we'll continue to do that to look at it. To the extent inflationary pressures are down, that means there's probably a little less inflationary pressure on wages. But we give -- over half of our employees are top of scale and they're getting increases irrespective of some of the extra things we talked about every March. And then as you go from a new employee over the first 9,000 or 10,000 hours, you're getting constant increases that are more -- significantly more. Corey Tarlowe : Understood. And then just piggybacking off of that, and I understand it may be difficult to attribute a cause and effect relationship to this. But do you think that perhaps the moderating inflation that we've seen in the need-based categories like fresh and food and sundries may have unlocked a little bit of extra wallet to spend in the non-food category? And they have driven some of the momentum that you've seen in categories like TVs and others? Richard Galanti : I think it can't hurt even with gas prices have come down a little bit. That's top of mind every week when somebody fills up their tank. So those things help. I think I'm sure on a macro basis, that's the case but it's a guess on our part. Corey Tarlowe : Understood. Great. Thank you very much and best of luck. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dean Rosenblum with Bernstein. Dean Rosenblum : Hey, Richard, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. There's really two big debates that clients are asking us about. First one is on gross margins, and in particular, the potential for a gross margin impact from mix shift back toward things like appliances and TVs, which are notoriously lower gross margin, at least in the marketplace versus fresh and food and sundries. As you see the sort of big ticket discretionary starting to come back a little bit, do you expect any overall impact on gross margins from that mix shift away from food and sundries to big ticket discretionary? Richard Galanti : First of all, our margin range is so much more compacted than traditional retail, different categories of traditional retail. I mean, if you think about it, we have, what, 12%, 13% gross margin, 11%. I'm thinking markup, and in theory, it ranges from 0% to 15%. In reality, it's -- there's very few things that are below 5% and a lot of things hover around the 8% to 12% range. And so I don't think it's as big of an impact to us in terms of those mix changes. And I got to say it's always all saying it's always something. There's always something that hurts you and there's another thing that helps you. And it's a really -- it's a mixture. Dean Rosenblum : True. And then the other big debate that's contrasting about is the relative profitability of new stores versus existing stores. There's sort of two themes there. One is new U.S. versus existing U.S. and then the relative profitability of new stores internationally. I was wondering if you could speak to that a bit. Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, when you look at like at an ROI, the eye on the denominator on an older building is a lower eye (ph). If 10 years ago, the typical building in the United States property equipment and building fixtures, I'm shooting from the hip here, was $30 million to $35 million and now it's $45 million to $50 million. So you've got a different eye. But generally speaking, when we look at the ROI of each of our eight U.S. regions, our two Canadian regions, new units come in, start a little lower and get up there over time. You'll have some outliers because of some units that are 30- and 40-years-old even with eye (ph) increase because we expanded the unit and upgraded it and remodeled it. The fact of the matter is the higher volume is really shine through there. On an international standpoint, we've always, I think, talked about the fact that there's a few different things that the ROIs in some of these other countries tend to be a little higher. The return on sales tends to be even more -- even higher than that in some of these countries because a combination very little related to gross margin, some related to membership fees, some related to wages and some related to benefits, health benefits. U.S. health care costs dwarf every other country that we're in. Dean Rosenblum : Got it. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Good holidays and thanks for the pie. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joseph Feldman : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to first ask on Executive member penetration seems like it continues to inch higher. And I was just wondering how you guys think about that. And like how high should that be? I mean presumably, you want everybody to be an Executive member. But is there like kind of a natural level where you think it can still go from here beyond the 46%? Richard Galanti : I think -- well, there's always going to be another country or two we add. You need a certain number. In our view, we've always done it after there's 15 or so warehouses in the country. So that will add to it a little bit. But no, I think some of the increase -- it's kind of like getting up to that asymptotic line when you -- one of the things that drove it in the last few years, one, we've done a better job in the last several years of selling it to you as well as auto renewal. When people come in now or sign up online, they're signing up to they want to put their credit or debit card in there and they can opt in to doing it online -- doing other renewal. So I think those things have pushed it along with us being so wonderful. But I think you'll still see it come up a little bit but probably that rate of increase will slow over time. Joseph Feldman : Got it. Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. Anything to talk about on shrink because I know that there was an issue with shrink even for you guys at one point. And I know you guys have cracked down on making sure members are showing their cards when they walk in the store. And obviously, when you leave with your goods, you're checking your receipts. But anything we should think about with regard to shrink going forward and recent trends? Richard Galanti : Thankfully, nothing at all. It's really -- I think what we already talked about was a combination of, as we went into some self-check out over the last several years and then perhaps more recent things that you read about in the paper, we get less impacted by the latter as well. Maybe we saw a couple of basis point delta upward on a very low number of basis points to start with. So we're fortunate in that regard. Joseph Feldman : Got it. Thank you and happy holidays, guys. Richard Galanti : Same to you. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Laura Champine with Loop Capital. Laura Champine : Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig in a little bit more into some of those numbers on the column. The ancillary profit improvement, I think that's where you're -- I'm just wondering what drove that. And on the operations line, it sounds like that pressure in SG&A didn't come mostly from wages and I'm wondering where it did come from. Richard Galanti : Yes. On the ancillary line, it's gas and e-com and it's a combination of increased sales penetration and increased margins within those businesses. The thing about gas is I think everybody out there that has gas stations, what we have found is we've been able to see improved profitability not just in the last quarter or two, but over the last few years -- last three to five years, improved profitability in gas because others are making more, and we're allowed to make a little more. When we do our competitive price shops on gas, which we do weekly at every gas stations, we operate with our neighboring competitive gas stations. On the e-comm side, I think driving more sales has helped us in the margins there as well. Laura Champine : Thanks. And then just on the operations... Richard Galanti : Yeah. On the wages, while we pointed out \u2013 I pointed out on the call, I think there was like four or so basis points in total from those two distinct increases, we do other increases like over half of our employees are top of scale. They get an increase every March that\u2019s significant as well, significant relative to basis points. When you have lower sales figures. I mean, and \u2013 the rest of it is all the other lines like energy costs and the like. Laura Champine : Got it. So most of the pressure is probably coming from wages, not just those two discrete callouts you had? Richard Galanti : It\u2019s more than half. I don\u2019t have the exact figures with me. Q \u2013 Laura Champine : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Richard Galanti for any additional or closing remarks. Richard Galanti : Well, thank you, Lisa, and thank you, everyone on the call. We\u2019re around to answer questions and have a happy holiday. And I think this is a record time of finishing this call. So enjoy the holidays. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude the presentation. Thank you for your participation today, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Costco Wholesale Corporation's Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Richard Galanti, CFO. Please go ahead. Richard Galanti : Thank you, Debbie, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the Company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law. Comparable sales and comparable sales excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the 12 weeks ended February 18th, as well as February retail sales for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, March 3rd. Reported net income for the 12-week second quarter came in at $1.743 billion or $3.92 per diluted share, up from $1.466 billion or $3.30 per diluted share in the 12-week second quarter last year. This year's results included a tax benefit of $94 million or $0.21 per diluted share due to the deductibility of the $15 per share special dividend to the extent received by our employee 401(k) plan participants. Net sales for the second quarter was $57.33 billion, an increase of 5.7% from the $54.24 billion in the second quarter last year. Net sales were negatively impacted by approximately 1.5% in the US and worldwide from the shift of the fiscal calendar as a result of the 53-week 2023 fiscal year. The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year-over-year and comparable retail weeks. For the -- in the US, we reported a 4.3% comparable. Excluding gas, deflation, and FX, the 4.3% would have been a 4.8%. Canada reported comp of -- for the quarter 9.2%, 9.0% ex-gas and FX. Other International 8.6%, and 8.2% ex-gas and FX. Total company 5.6% reported for the quarter, and a 5.8% excluding gas, deflation, and FX. E-commerce was an 18.4% reported, and an 18.2% excluding FX. In terms of second quarter comp sales metrics, our traffic or shopping frequency increased by 5.3% worldwide and 4.3% in the US. Foreign -- our average transaction or ticket was up three tenth of a percent worldwide and up one tenth of a percent in the US. And foreign currencies relative to the US dollar positively impact sales by approximately two tenth of a percent. While gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately four tenth of a percent minus. Moving down the income statement to membership fee income. We reported membership fee income of $1.111 billion, up $84 million or up 8.2% year-over-year in the quarter. In terms of renewal rates, at second quarter end, our US and Canada renewal rate came in at 92.9%, which is up one tenth of a percent from Q1 and 12 weeks earlier. And the worldwide rate came in also at 90.5%, similar to the last quarter. Membership growth continues. We ended the second quarter with 73.4 million paid household members, up 7.8% versus last year, and 132.0 million cardholders, up 7.3%, with continuing growth throughout the quarters. At Q2 end, we had 33.9 million paid executive members, an increase of 646,000 during the 12-week second quarter. Executive members represent a little over 46% of paid members and a little over 73% of worldwide sales. Moving down the income statement line, next, to the gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the second quarter was higher year-over-year by 8 basis points, coming in at 10.80% compared to 10.72% last year in the quarter, and at 4 basis points excluding gas deflation. Writing down the little matrix that we usually do with two columns, both reported and excluding gas deflation. First line item is core merchandise, plus 5% -- plus 5 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis, and plus 2 basis points ex-deflation -- gas deflation. Ancillary and other, plus 7 basis points and plus 6 basis points. 2% reward, minus 7 basis points and minus 7 basis points. LIFO, plus 3 basis points and plus 3 basis points. And all told, total reported, again, gross margin year-over-year up 8 basis points and up 4 basis points excluding gas deflation. In terms of the core margin on their own sales, again, while the number I just read you was a plus 5% -- plus 5 basis points and plus 2 basis points ex-gas deflation. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were up 25 basis points year-over-year, with food and sundries and non-foods being positive year-over-year and fresh being negative. Ancillary and other businesses, gross margins were higher by 7 basis points and higher by 6 basis points ex-gas. The increase year-over-year was driven largely by e-comm and partially offset by gas. 2% reward, again higher 7 basis points -- lower by 7 basis points both with and without gas deflation, with higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO, plus 3 basis points. We had a $14 million LIFO credit in the second quarter of this year compared to no LIFO charge or credit in the second quarter of last year. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A in the second quarter was higher year-over-year by 3 basis points or minus 3 basis points would be higher, coming in at -- this year at 9.14% compared to last year's 9.11%. And the higher 0.3% would have been lower by 1 basis point excluding gas deflation. In terms of Q2 year-over-year, the operations component of SG&A, doing the matrix, was 11 basis points higher, or minus 11 basis points. Ex-gas deflation, minus 8 basis points, so 8 basis points higher. Central, plus 4 basis points and plus 5 basis points. Stock compensation, plus 4 basis points and plus 4 basis points. And total would be 3 basis points higher year-over-year and plus 1 basis point or 1 basis point lower year-over-year or better. And with regard to the operations component being higher by 11 basis points reported and 8 basis points excluding deflation. As compared to a year ago, since -- during the past year, we included two last March's extra top-of-scale increase in wages, which was about a 2 basis point hit to the SG&A line. As well, in the first quarter of this year we raised the starting wage in the US and Canada. We estimate the impact of that new wage also was a roughly 2 basis point. So, about 4 basis points of that 8 basis points or 4 basis points of that 11 basis points were related to those two wage increases, more than normal. Below the operating income line, Central I mentioned was better by 4 basis points or 5 basis points, and the rest was pretty much straightforward. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $41 million this year versus $34 million last year and interest income and other for the quarter was higher by $102 million year-over-year. This was driven by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates and higher average cash balances, as well as FX which was favorable versus last year. We'll see less benefit from interest income going forward following the January payment of the $6.7 billion special dividend. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the second quarter came in at 22.1% compared to 26.1% in Q2 last year. As discussed earlier, this year's rate benefited from the tax deductibility of a special dividend paid to 401(k) participants. The fiscal 2024 effective tax rate including discrete items is currently projected to be in the 26% to 27% range. And excluding the special dividend tax benefit in Q2, our Q2 tax rate instead of being -- coming in at 22.1% would have been 26.3%. Overall, reported net income was up 18.9% in the quarter on a reported basis. And again, excluding the special dividend-related income tax benefit, it would have been up 12.5% year-over-year. A few other items of note. In terms of openings in the second quarter, we opened four net new warehouses, including three new locations in the US. Actually, two of them were Costco business centers, and one new Costco Wholesale warehouse, and one unit in -- our sixth in China in mid-January in Shenzhen. That's our six in China. There's been a lot of press about it. We have an estimated 10,000 people who were at opening and there are just under 200,000 members currently, including more than 20,000 members who signed-up from Hong Kong. And we've seen all kinds of things over there from tour agencies doing bus trips over to shop. For the full year 2024, we estimate 30 total openings, including two relo's, so for a net increase of 28 new units. And that puts the remainder of fiscal 2024 for Q3 and Q4, we plan on opening a total of 15 net new locations, 11 in the US, two in Japan, and one each in Korea and in China. Regarding CapEx, fiscal second quarter spend was approximately $1.03 billion. And for the year, it remains in the north of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion, in that range. One additional comment on China. This past Monday, we launched in our Pudong, China location, the ability for our members to order online about 400 items from our -- of our items to be delivered that day. This -- and the delivery will be within about an eight kilometer radius of the warehouse itself. That's getting a lot of social media attention over there and we plan to launch it in the other four Shanghai area locations by month-end, as well as in Shenzhen sometime the following month. In terms of e-commerce, e-commerce sales in Q2 ex-FX increased 18.2%. E-com showed strength in several areas, led by sales of gold and very recently silver. As well, appliances were very, very strong, as was gift cards and e-tickets. As well, Costco Logistics enjoyed record-breaking deliveries. Much of that -- many of those items are sold via e-commerce. In Q2 of 2024, we completed over 1 million deliveries, up 28% versus Q2 a year ago. In terms of e-commerce sales over the past few months, we believe we've done a much better job explaining to our members the significant value propositions we offer compared to traditional competitors in several big-ticket categories. Under the Why Buy At Costco banner and The Price You See Is The Price You Pay banner, we share with our members what's included in the price of appliances, tires, televisions, computers, and mattresses. You can see these online on our website of Why Buy At Costco. Just to give you one example. If you take a four-set of high-end tires compared to a traditional retailer, we include, of course, installation, rotation, balancing, a five-year road hazard warranty. Typically that's a lot less road hazard warranty than other places, or you'd have to pay for it extra, ongoing flat repairs, nitrogen, and disposal of the prior tires. So, just one of the examples where the price of the tires itself might be very close to us. When you put in all the differences of those additional items, it's anywhere from a 15% to 25% savings on any of these items. Next on my list, talk about costconext.com, a couple of comments on the seller platform. This allows -- costconext.com allows our members to exclusive asset -- access to direct-to-consumer sites for top-quality brands at Costco value pricing. Currently, there are about 70 -- there are 70 Costco Next brand sites, with 15 additional sites in development. We will likely end this calendar year with about 90 sites and continue to grow from there. Costco Next offers everything from home improvement to apparel to pet to home to kitchen to electronics to accessories, as well as sports, bicycles, and toys. You should check it out, it's a pretty good site. Progress continues to be made in our e-com, mobile, and digital efforts. A couple of recent enhancements. In February, we rolled out our new native mobile application homepage on iOS. The native homepage now loads in less than 2 seconds compared to 8 seconds previously. Needless to say, that's important when about 60% of our e-com business, both visitors and orders, are now done via our mobile app and browser. And last week, we rolled out Apple Pay to all members online, both web and mobile, on February 28th. App downloads during the quarter were up 2.8 million and currently total around 33 million. On the product side, a couple of other new items to comment on. In our food courts, we recently replaced the churro with an awesome freshly baked 5.5-ounce chocolate chip cookie for $2.49. It is awesome. It's a great-tasting -- and a great-tasting turkey sandwich for $6.99, with the rollout of the latter being completed this week. In addition, we recently opened our first fully operated sushi offering in Issaquah, Washington, across the street from our headquarters, with two more planned to open in the very near future. This operation is what we have successfully done for years -- for many years, and throughout our Asia Costcos and several countries over there. The sushi program has proven to be a category where we can be successful in both quality and price, and we're looking forward to seeing more of that in the future. A couple of comments about inflation. In the last quarter, in the first quarter, we estimated that year-over-year inflation was approximately zero to 1%. We'll now say that in Q2, it was essentially flat. And notwithstanding essentially flat, we're taking price reductions where we can. Anecdotally, everything from simple items like reading glasses from $18.99 to $16.99, the 48 count of Kirkland Signature batteries from $17.99 to $15.99, a 24 count of Pellegrino from $16.99 to $14.99, and even a four pounds of frozen three berry fruit blend from $14.99 down to $10.99 with new crop pricing. So, we continue to do that. We always want to be the first out there trying to lower prices. Many new items in sporting goods and lawn and garden are being set with lower prices year-over-year, and overall, mostly due to reduced freight costs and lower commodity costs versus a year ago. And overall, our inventories and SKUs are in good shape across all channels. Overall, we've had good seasonal sell-through during the quarter. In terms of shipping and supply chain issues, we've been asked about that often of late. There are some delays, generally just a couple to three weeks, but mostly now planned for. First, there was an issue a while back with the Panama Canal challenges. Then, of course, the Red Sea challenges. A lot of that has to do with changing the way ships are being routed. No meaningful pricing issues because a lot have been placed contracts. Finally, turning to our February sales results, the four weeks ended this past Sunday, March 3rd, compared to the same retail calendar weeks last year. As reported in our release, that sales for the month came in at $18.21 billion, an increase of 6.9%, versus $17.04 billion for the same four retail weeks last year. Again, just to announce what we did in the announcement earlier today, the US reported comp of 3.4% for February, ex-gas and FX, 4.1%. Canada, 8.4% and 8.3%. Other international, 10.8% and 11.3%. For our total Company, a 5.0% reported and a 5.6% ex-gas and FX, with e-com coming in at a 16.2% reported and a 16.0% ex-FX. Our comp traffic or frequency for February was up 6.2% worldwide and up 5.0% in the US. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to the dollar negatively impacted total and comparable sales as follows : Canada by about one tenth of a percent negative; other international by approximately 0.5%; and total Company by approximately one tenth of a percent. Gasoline price deflation negatively impacted total reported comp sales by approximately 0.5%, and the average worldwide selling price per gallon of gas was down approximately 3.5% versus last year. Worldwide, the average transaction for February was down about 1.1%, which includes the negative impacts from FX and gas deflation. In terms of regional and merchandising categories, the general highlights are as follows : US regions with the strongest comps were Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast. In terms of other international in local currencies, we saw strength in Mexico, Australia, and Korea. Moving to merchandise highlights, food and sundries were positive in the mid-single-digits. Fresh foods were up high-single-digits, and non-foods were positive mid-single-digits. And ancillary businesses were up in the low-single-digits. Food court, pharmacy, and optical were top performers, with gas down low-single-digits on a lower price per gallon. In terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our March sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, April 7th on the following Wednesday, April 10th after market close. And lastly, before I turn it back to Demi for Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to say thank you to many of you who have turned in to each quarter, some for many years, to allow me to share with you Costco's results, both our ups and our downs, and thankfully many more ups than downs, and provide some fun and informative color on how we're doing along the way. Since going public in December of 1985, I have hosted all but one call and it's been an absolute privilege and honor to do so. So, thank you all. As you know, in early February, it was announced that I will be ceding the role of CFO to Gary Millerchip effective March 15th after our second quarter 10-Q is filed, and retire, including from our Board, next January. It's a bit surreal of late, but what a wonderful journey it has been with such a great Company and great people, including many of you on the call today. I have certainly been very fortunate. The good news, Gary joined Costco last week, and along with David and Josh, will continue to provide to you all with the transparency and straightforwardness that we are known for. It will be a positive and seamless transition. With that, I will be happy to turn it back to Demi to open it up for Q&A. Operator : The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Hi, everyone. Hey, Richard, best wishes to you. Thank you for all your guidance. That's a metaphor since you don't give guidance. My first question is on the -- this is like a parting question on membership, and I want to make sure this framework sounds right. I know you said it's if, not when. And as part of the thought process is, there are enough levers in the business, product savings, cost savings, to be able to drive an appropriate level of profit growth from the business. And when that no longer presents itself, that's when the membership price increase can come through. And that can come through earlier than that, but that was one framework we were thinking in this, as we wait to hear when it happens. Richard Galanti : Sure. And by the way, it's when, not if, still. And but really, joking aside, we're not that smart in terms of figuring out exactly why. I mean we know that all the factors that we believe, if we wanted to do it, would we feel comfortable in terms of renewal rates, new member signups, loyalty, all those things are continuing in the right direction. It really is a function. And I don't think it would be done simply because, hey, things have slowed down a little bit, let's do it now. We like the fact that we're performing well. We like the fact that almost all metrics are going in the right direction in our business right now. We've got plenty of runway left. And given the economy and given everything else, it's us, it's Costco, so I think it is simply still not trying to be accede about it, it's not some big analytical formula, it's simply a measure of we will at some point, I'm sure, do it. And I've been joking with Gary, it'll be on his watch, not mine. Simeon Gutman : And then maybe one more, Richard, is another question. You used to -- the business has comped very consistently over time and you used to say, I regret when it won't comp north of 4% to 5% because that's where it may be tougher to leverage our expenses. If you think about that framework, does it still apply? And then as you hand the baton to Gary and even Ron, do you spend more or are there ways where you -- the cost structure of the business can actually be altered to lower that leveraged threshold point? Richard Galanti : Right. Well, I would say it's probably more likely to go up a little bit down just because of whatever goes on in life with inflation that happened. But I got to look back at the last few years. We were -- we and others were helped through the crisis of COVID. And we haven't given a lot of that back. If I look at our SG&A, I remember when in fiscal 2019, it came in at a $10.04 billion. I'm looking at these numbers here. And even in 2020, it was at a $10.30 billion in the first quarter before COVID. And then in fiscal 2021, it was at $9.65 billion and then down to an $8.88 billion. And now it's up to fiscal 2023, it was a $9.08 billion. So, notwithstanding that, I remember when it was slightly above $10 billion, we said, well, it's never going to get below $10 billion again. And a lot of factors continue to change. But just the sheer high productivity that we have is frankly higher than we thought. Some of that was gained through COVID because of everything else going on. But we haven't given it back. The good news is, we haven't given it back. And the good news continues to be that we seem to continue to be able to take market share. I think the fact that on big-ticket items, there's less SG&A. We continue to change the pack sizes of things for less freight, whatever it is. Although freight would be, that would be SG&A. But it is still a lot about sales at the end. And if you ask the rhetorical question, if comps went to zero, what would that mean? That would be tough on SG&A, but we'd figure other things out. Simeon Gutman : Yes. Okay. Best wishes. Thanks, Richard. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. Chuck Grom : Hey, good afternoon. Richard, congrats on a great career, for someone who started on basically day one at the Company. My question is on culture. You've always said it was customers first, employees second, shareholders third, and that philosophy's clearly played out. So, looking at it, I'm curious how the new team is going to keep this culture intact and resist pressure from some of the non-founders of the Company going forward. Richard Galanti : Well, first of all, nothing has changed. It's not unlike the same question I think that was asked of Jim Senegal after 28 years before he retired, and before we knew who his successor was going to exactly be. And I remember the Board asking, if you're 100 in terms of extreme value and extreme taking care of the customer and the employee and everybody else, whoever takes your place, what will they be? And he paused for a minute and said, I have no doubt they'll be at least in the mid-90s if not higher. And frankly, after Craig was made that, in my view, whatever that number was, it increased towards a 100 just because that's what we do. That culture is so ingrained here. And we talk about changing management. I always joke when people ask me as CFO how I'm important -- am I important to the strategic whatever of the Company? The fact is, is we're run by merchants and operators, and we're there to serve and help them and certainly add our voice. But the fact of the matter is, and Craig for 12 years and now in Ron, you have people that have been here for 35, 40 years and were born and raised and have grown up in this culture. And it is so intact. Just last week when Gary joined us, he had to go through the required two-hour Costco orientation, which includes the obey the law, to take care of your customer, to take care of your employee, to respect your supplier. And then if you do that, you can reward the shareholder. It is -- that's the one thing I can sleep very well at night. Chuck Grom : That's great. Thanks, Richard. Enjoy your retirement. Richard Galanti : Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good evening. Thank you so much for taking my question and best of luck, Richard. You mentioned previously that most of the metrics are moving in the right direction. Could you highlight which metrics are not moving in the right direction, especially from a membership per club standpoint? Are there any signs that some of the more mature locations are either reaching a saturation or starting to see a peak in that metric? Richard Galanti : No. First of all, when I said most, I was just trying to be human, that nobody is perfect. Everything is working in the right direction right now. And actually, I wasn't talking just about membership metrics, but in general, knock on wood, things are working pretty well. When I -- when we sit in at our monthly budget meeting, more times than not, we get pretty excited about what's going on from a new merchandising standpoint, newness, buying with conviction, and being aggressive and assertive out there. I mean, what we saw with just even that simple example I gave you with changes to big ticket items and why buy them at Costco, we saw great changes in numbers. So, we know that we've got a lot of levers to be able to pull to make this thing work. And so no, I just said, honestly, I said most because nobody is perfect. I didn't have any particular examples. Michael Lasser : Understood. My follow-up question is on what seems like an inflection in the discretionary business. To what degree is Costco experiencing improvement in the GenMerch categories as a result of aggressive changes, either like you had cited with the way you're communicating with the customer or the member, or aggressive actions to take down prices? And if you are pulling those levers hard, is there an opportunity to move even more aggressively to drive the discretionary business? Because it does seem like Costco is experiencing a rebound in some of these areas more so than the rest of retail. Thank you. Richard Galanti : Yes. And no, and absolutely. When -- what is it? It's called -- it used to be NPD, it's Circana, which is that industry that shows you how you are on different product -- non-food product categories versus the industry. When we look at something like appliances in the last several weeks or a couple of months, the industry is flat and we're up north of 20%. Same thing with tires, more than that percent. And so, now that you can't say, let's do everything and everything will be up 20% or 30% because that's not going to happen. But at the end of the day, the focus of the buyers, as an example, is coming up with new ways to do things, to have great pricing, and to constantly improve that pricing and figure out how to do that with our global buying power with -- every time there's a commodity price increase. Given an item business, we have buyers that are in charge of 20 and 30 items, if not less, not 200 and 300 items in a category. They know a lot more, in our view, about every cost component of that. And I think -- I feel very good that we do a very good job, and I'm not suggesting others don't, but I know we do a very good job of getting on the phone immediately and working those issues. And as soon as we can get a savings, we're out there first passing it on. And that's just our religion. Now, we're able to do that partly because our sales have been relatively strong, and we've lapped some things from last year that have helped. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is open. Peter Benedict : Sure. Thanks for taking the question, and my congratulations as well. Well done. It's been a pleasure. Wondering if you can maybe talk about Kirkland, the penetration, what's going on there, any member shopping behavior around kind of private brand versus branded, and maybe what some of the branded packaged good companies are doing to maybe get some volumes up. Just curious about your view on that. Richard Galanti : There's not a lot of trade down, although when we -- we sometimes have more control over certain private labeled CPG items that we're able to drive more business, and so we're seeing an increased penetration of that versus some of the brands sometimes. But then that gets the brands to the table to work to provide more value on the branded as well. We want to be both. But we haven't really seen -- that was a question that happened as \"the economy was\" -- the question is, are we going into a recession, a couple of years ago, and inflation was peaking at 7%, 8%, and 9%, and are we seeing a difference? So, we did see a -- if you look back over the last 20 years, and without looking at the exact numbers, it seems like every year we'd grow a 0.25% to a 0.5% of increased Kirkland Signature penetration. And then there was one year when we were asked a couple of years ago, it seemed like there was 1% to -- 1.5% to 2% -- even 2% change in penetration. So, people were, in my view, switching a little bit out, but that's changed. We don't see that as much anymore. Peter Benedict : Got it. And then just on Costco Logistics, you gave some delivery numbers there. Just maybe step back a little bit. The penetration of Costco Logistics within the business, how meaningful is that at this point? What's left in terms of maybe growing that? Is that just going to go with the big ticket trends, or are there, I don't know, internal initiatives to kind of drive further penetration of Costco Logistics? Richard Galanti : What is done strategically, I hate to overuse that word, it's allowed us to be much better in value and delivery times and quality, and brought the delivery costs down on big ticket items, particularly appliances and big screen televisions, mattresses, and furniture, indoor and outdoor patio and mattress and patio furniture and indoor furniture, some sporting goods. And before we bought Innovel, we're now called Costco Logistics in the spring of 2020. And the year before that, in the US, we did about 2.2 million drops. And a drop is anything from dropping off a sofa to delivering and installing a new refrigerator, freezer, or washer, dryer, and taking the old one away for disposal. Both of those are a drop, recognizing their extreme difference there. But we did about 2.2 million drops in the US, none of which we did ourselves. With the acquisition of Innovel, I think for the - probably over the last -- with this million this quarter, a rough number of 4 million drops, which I believe about 70% of them -- over 4 million drops, and about 70% of them is us. We've reduced the delivery times. We've just introduced in some categories like two-hour windows where you can -- or three-hour windows where you can choose, two-hour windows where you can choose. So, we're constantly getting better, and we've greatly improved the value. And when you look at something, a category like appliances, we're still a very low percentage of the industry. And, the fact that it was up, 20%-plus last month or last quarter, is a function of some of the things we're doing in terms of shouting out how good of a deal it is and doing a better job of that. But we think we have an opportunity to continue to grow those categories, recognizing they're all meaningful categories, but they're all small percentages of our total. That's one of the nice things about us that we have lots of different categories. Peter Benedict : Got it. Great. Well, thanks again, and best of luck, Richard. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Rupesh Parikh : Good evening, and thanks for taking my question. And Richard, I also want to offer my congratulations on your retirement. So just going back to the core on core margins, they're up, I think, 25 basis points this quarter. Just curious what drove that strong performance, if there is anything in particular driving that? Richard Galanti : Well, on the non-food side, the biggest thing is -- well, not the big -- a piece of it is comparing to last year when we had extra markdowns. I think we probably talked about it last time that non-food was -- a year ago had been down year-over-year because of some of the supply chain challenges we had when such things were coming in late after the season in case some of the big ticket items from overseas containers. So, that was probably a chunk of it. On the Fresh food side, I said it was down year-over-year a little. Fresh is competitive, and we're being ever competitive on it as well. And -- but again, I don't view any of that as being terribly meaningful in terms of, is that a big change that is coming. There's always something that's up a little bit, and there's another thing that's down a little bit. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. On the expense side, you guys did have better expense controls this quarter. So, just curious to what changed sequentially, because the growth rate did decelerate by a few percentage points. Richard Galanti : I can't think off the top of my head other than I -- actually, someone across the table has just said the word focus. At our budget meetings, which happen every four weeks with 150-plus people in town from all over the world, those are the kind of things we look at. And I think the operators are doing a better job of budgeting. And one of the things I think that came out at the last budget meeting in terms of budgeting, if you budget sales a little higher and they came in a percentage -- a percent lower, you've got to your labor costs. And so a lot of it has to do with focus and being meaningful about it. We certainly don't try to control expenses by not doing a wage increase when we think we need to, and we certainly have done that. Rupesh Parikh : Thank you. Best of luck. Richard Galanti : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Your line is open. Scott Mushkin : Hey, thanks. Hey, Richard, I feel like we should be, like, raising your jersey to the Rafters like a superstar is retiring here. I never came without you, to tell you the truth. So, congratulations. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Scott Mushkin : So, here you are. So, yes. So, we'll have to see that The CFO Hall of Fame. So, a couple of things, some of your comments that you made. You're doing this delivery in one hour in China. I think you started going from one club to three. Is that something you envision that can expand outside of China? And how should we think about that, maybe even vis-a-vis the US? Richard Galanti : Well, in a way, we're doing the same thing here with a few people, most notably Instacart. And a little bit was shipped down in the Southeast. And I think we've got a test in Texas with Uber. But at the end of the day, we had that same-day delivery already as function. Over there, it is a third-party that's doing it, like Instacart or these other ventures here. So, it's just -- it's new. It's not something that's new to the warehouse club industry in China. You could look elsewhere and find it too. But it's certainly something that makes sense. And again, in part because of social media, there's been a lot of publicity and just, I mean, from the day it launched three days ago, it's gone nuts in terms of how many page hits it's getting and all that stuff. But it's just part of the business. Scott Mushkin : Got it. And then we've talked about this over the years, and I think you said you're going to do 28 net new clubs this year. What's the capacity of the organization? Where do you go? Do you envision that going to 35 and 40? Like, how should we think of it as we move out three to five years? Is it something that's going to trend up? Richard Galanti : I think, who knows, but I think generally it probably trends up a little. There was a few years there, excluding the year when COVID hit, that we only did like 13 because there were shutdowns in certain countries of construction and as well as the US. But if you look back, excluding that year over a three or five-year period, plus or minus a couple of years there, it was about 23 a unit. Without looking at numbers, about 23 units a year. At the time, you said, what do you see over the next 10 years? What we saw collectively was is somewhere in the, hopefully, targeting, let's say, 25 for the next five years per year, and then going up to 25 to somewhere in the high-20s, if not 30. I think that's generally the sense that we feel. Could we do more? Yes. Are we comfortable doing it this way? Yes. I think part of that is it's such a hands-on business. I get to say that from sitting here in headquarters most of the time, not traveling like my colleagues do in operations. But, Ron is a great example. I mean, he and several regional executives in operations, if there's an opening somewhere, or not an opening, they're out visiting, usually at least two, if not three weeks a month, or out for three or four days, jumping around, visiting locations, not only existing locations, but new sites. And so, I think from a standpoint -- and the other thing is, particularly in newer countries, you want to get the first one open so you can train 50 or 80 people that want to move to the next location in that city that'll help that one go. And we were very fortunate a few years back in the first Shanghai, in Minhang in China, where we had a number of employees from Taiwan that wanted to move and be promoted into new locations, new jobs over there. So, that helps us when we have one, then two, then four, then whatever. So we take it slow. All I know is, we're all very busy, and, particularly the operators and merchants as well. And so that's kind of the paradigm that I think that we're going to continue to work at. Something in the 25 range, and then heading up. Just a month -- just a quarter ago, I think our budget for this year was 32, and now -- or 31, now it's 28. And that's simply timing. There is two or three that are pushed, that for whatever, construction delays, or you found something in the soil delays, or whatever it might be, they might have moved from mid to late summer to early fall, which is the new fiscal year. So, I'm feeling pretty good that we're going to open 25-plus for the next couple of years, and then probably 28-plus, and go on from there. Scott Mushkin : Perfect. Thanks, Richard. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Gregory Melich : Hi. Thanks, Richard. You mentioned the word surreal, the feeling of retiring. I'd say it's almost as surreal as a $4.99 chicken. So, thank you for all the help over the years. I would say, I guess two things I want to touch on. One is ticket pressure. It looks like just in the most recent sales, with traffic growing more and more, that you're seeing some AUR pressure. Is that 0% inflation turning to deflation, as the merchants are seeing into March and April? Richard Galanti : Well, I think that, again, the inflation number is a calculation based on costs and mix. I think it's probably -- I wouldn't look too closely if the average ticket was up a couple of -- a few tenths in the quarter, and then it was down a percent, down in February by a tenth. That's still relatively close. Some of it's a mix change, I'm sure, and some of it is -- some of the examples I gave you about lower pricing. Even if the underlying cost hasn't changed, some of it may be in terms of how we package, and we take advantage of that. So -- and that's on the sales side and not on -- not the exact cost from yesterday. Gregory Melich : So, looking ahead, that number of flat looks pretty good from what the merchants are seeing today. Richard Galanti : Yes. I think when I go to the last budget meeting two weeks ago, I think there's -- in the presentations, there's a lot of -- I used the phrase a few minutes ago, upscaling. I didn't use that phrase, but then buying with conviction. I mean, I think the buyers are looking ahead right now in an offensive way and a positive way. Hopefully, we'll be right, but we feel so far we're being right. Gregory Melich : I wanted to follow up with my second question on the Instacart side of e-commerce penetration. What would e-commerce penetration be now in the US if you included the Instacart delivery and the other deliveries? Richard Galanti : Yes. Instacart is 1.5% to 2% percent, something below 2%, but more to 1.5%, which is still on a $200 billion retailer, it's a lot. And we don't include that because that -- the Instacart person comes in, buys it, and checks out at the front end, so we don't include that. So, you'd add -- depending on rounding, you'd add 1% to 2% to the top-line number. Gregory Melich : Got it. Well, thanks. Thanks for everything, and enjoy retirement. Richard Galanti : I hope to see you all. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Your line is open. Kelly Bania : Good evening. Thanks, Richard, and I have to add my congratulations to you. It's been a pleasure. Just wanted to ask where Costco stands with retail media and advertising dollars. I think the last update I had was in the range of a few hundred million. Just curious if you're willing to share with us where that stands today, what kind of growth that is experiencing, and just the Company's thought process on investing in that down the line. Richard Galanti : Well, without giving numbers out, we know there's an opportunity there more than we've done in the past. In the last six or eight months, we've brought on people that are seasoned in this business to help us, and it's a point of focus. We know that there's money out there. We've always been very successful in other forms of vendor buckets, whether it's end caps or advertising in our own Costco connection. And, of course, over the last several years, some advertising online or banners or placement, but there's a lot more that can be done there. Rest assured, whatever it is, we're going to use it to -- just like when we always said if we can save a dollar on buying something, we're going to give $0.80 or $0.90 to the customer. I think that mantra will continue on this side as well. So -- but there's certainly ability for more dollars out there. Some of our big retail competitors have talked about doubling in five or six years what they have. I think, again, it's a lower market share for us, so there's a little more opportunity for us to continue to grow that. Kelly Bania : Thank you. And maybe just can I just follow up with the decision to roll out Apple Pay? Costco is pretty notorious for being strict on the payment method you can use. So just maybe the thought process on that, what you expect that to do for your e-commerce business, and any economics you can share. Richard Galanti : Yes, on e-commerce, there's not as many stored cards for our members. And as we're doing more with a digital wallet, that'll help as well. So, it's something that should help. Kelly Bania : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Katy Hallberg : Hi there, this is Katy on for Oliver. And, of course, best wishes to you in your retirement. Just wanted to talk a little bit about the Kirkland price gap versus national brands. I know you touched on the Kirkland brand a little bit earlier on the call. But how has that price gap changed, especially year-over-year? And how has there -- has there been any impact to unit elasticity given that price discrepancy? Thank you. Richard Galanti : Well, we definitely have seen an impact from it. I think historically, the view was it has to be at least as good, if not better quality than the leading national brand, and at least a 20% savings as compared to what we sell the national brand for. And those metrics continue in that regard. I think what we've seen when we look at some of the items that have risen greatly in price, like paper products, on a percentage basis over the last several years because of freight costs, because of pulp prices, because of energy, all those things have dramatically increased. And what used to be -- I don't know the exact numbers, but for an 18-pack of -- a 24-pack of toilet tissue or a 15-pack or 18-pack of paper towels, you've got price points in the high $20s, if not low-to-mid $30s. And where we can show a dramatic savings on that, we've seen dramatic changes in unit market share towards Costco -- towards Kirkland Signature. But that's something that's been an iterative process over many years, probably goes up and down a little bit. I'd say it's gone up a little bit in terms of a little more of a penetration in the last couple of years. Katy Hallberg : Great. Thank you. And then just to follow up on the store discussion and unit growth, can you just provide a little bit of color on how the international store openings are performing just from a productivity angle? How is that versus the more tenured stores as well as the domestic stores? Richard Galanti : I don't think there's a big difference. In new markets, it's always a little slower. So, like when we opened originally in Iceland or Sweden or Auckland or some of those or France several years ago, you're always going to start -- or frankly, Japan 20 years ago, you tend to start out lower. In some cases, it's also a question is, some local vendors may not want to -- local country vendors may not want to sell you because they want to upset all the big traditional that have all the market share before we enter. And once we get two or three open, they talk to you a little more. And so I think all those things help us as we grow. Certainly, it's changed a little bit in the last few years. China being the most recent example, when we opened the first one in Minhang in Shanghai, what, about four years ago? It made international news based on just the sheer number of members we signed up and everything. So we have a lot faster start, I think. Each year, we have a lot faster start than the year before. And so I don't see a big difference there. We certainly -- if you look in the US, I mean, I think one thing that's interesting is this fiscal year, we're going to open, whatever, 28 units. Let me get my page here. And, I think of the 28, 20-plus are in the US, which is -- some people have asked, has it slowed down internationally? No, international takes a little longer to do. But what's interesting is, is we have a lot more runway than we ever thought possible. If you had asked us five years ago, by now, how many would we be putting in this year in the US? We would not have said 20-plus. It's got to slow down at some point. But the volumes that we're now doing in these locations, we've got to bleed some of that off. And so that's one good point. And then we've still got plenty going on overseas. And you'll see that continue to ramp up as well. Katy Hallberg : Excellent. Thank you so much, and best wishes again. Richard Galanti : Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Thanks for the time, guys. It seems like you guys are doing some things to cut down on membership sharing, food court usage from nonmembers, etc. Richard, are you seeing something in the business that gives you concern that there's a growing issue from things like membership sharing? Richard Galanti : No, I think part of it is -- first of all, I think the storyline sometimes is a little greater than the reality. During COVID, we did a little bit more. There was a little bit more membership sharing. You had individuals where one family member, maybe not the one that had one of the two memberships, was coming into shop with mom or dad's credit card. And we allowed it. And then with the advent of self-checkout over the last several years, when you walk in the front door and you just flash your card and do they look at it or not, who knows, you would -- people would get in. And if you're going through self-checkout, you're not having to show your membership card to the cashier. And so there's probably an increasing but still small level of abuse of that privilege. And -- but we also had complaints from members saying, I pay, why shouldn't they? So, the view was -- is we needed to just shore that up a little bit. And we did. We did it over a period of six months, I think about six months, where we -- first there was warnings, and then ultimately changed. Are we getting some new signups from it? Absolutely. But it's relative to the 60 million or 70 million members, it's not terribly meaningful. But it's more fair and the right thing to do. Scot Ciccarelli : Yes, I mean, that was actually -- you started to answer it. So, like you've seen some acceleration in membership. Should we kind of expect to see that in the future, like what we've seen with Netflix, for example, as they cut down on their sharing? Richard Galanti : Right. Well, it seems like Netflix had a much bigger issue or the ability to share was much easier because, first of all, it's electronic. In this sense, you still have to show a card when you walked in. And we're actually doing testing on that too, in terms of having your card be scanned and reviewed when you walk in. And we've done that in the UK, I believe, for a few years. And so it's all about -- just I would say it's as much hygiene as anything else. And it'll be slightly profitable to the extent that we make sure everybody -- I think we signed up more members than there were non-members then lost the small sales that that non-member did. Scot Ciccarelli : Makes sense. Thanks again. And enjoy the next stage. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. John Heinbockel : Congratulations, Richard. Enjoy your retirement. You'll be missed. So, when you think about -- you don't have many pain points in your in your clubs. But when you think about kind of throughput and things like, I know you tested BOPUS and cost really didn't make sense there. Things like that and/or scan and go, what -- do you think there are some unlocks here to do more volume and/or reduce any pain points? Richard Galanti : I think the biggest challenge with pain points, first of all, is full of merchandise and pallets through the system, which we continue to work on and improve. Never -- if you'd asked us 10 years ago, will you ever have 150 of your 600 US locations doing over $300 million and 40 of them doing over $400 million? The answer would be no, no way, even with inflation. The fact is, is we're doing a lot more volume than we've ever thought we would do. And so the biggest answer of not only making it a little more efficient, but driving more sales is cannibalizing. We find existing members that sometimes will say, I don't want to go there. It's too busy today. And by opening up that third or fourth unit in that city, we're seeing not an increase of by a third or fourth of the membership base, but a significant increase in sales. And I can't think of anything specifically. We're always doing things with -- Oh, David mentioned something here. One of the things we're in -- we should be doing shortly is having warehouse inventory online. So when you go online to -- now, I say that a couple of people in the room are smiling and says it may be a few months or a few more than a few months, but it'll be soon. But at the end of the day, if you look at something to buy online and we have it in the location or two in the zip code where you typically shop -- in the location you would shop physically, we'll let you know you can buy it there. And in many cases, it'll be cheaper if you go pick it up yourself because the online cost might be higher. It's typically higher, particularly on the non-food items. So, I think that's something that'll help that as well. John Heinbockel : And secondly, is there any way to tell you think about email outreach. I mean, it seems to be getting better and more call to action. I try to think about the seven days of spring, which are in the middle of now. Is there a way to tell the productivity of that outreach? And is that driving some of the e-com pickup? Richard Galanti : Absolutely. And yes, there is a way to tell. We're looking at it. Again, without going into a lot of detail, a couple of years ago, we brought in a new person in charge from IT in terms of all digital. He's built a team. They're working closely with merchants and operators, but mostly with merchants in terms of doing these types of things. And we've seen, again, lots of improvements with our app, with our desktop. It's getting less clunky by the day and more ability to do some items to drive sales and some promotions like that. John Heinbockel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Chris Horvers : Good evening and we'll miss you, Richard, and welcome aboard, Gary. So, on the MFI, can -- did you mention how much the FX impacted total MFI growth year-over-year? And more broadly, it seems like it's becoming more competitive to acquire customers in the club channel. Couponing amongst your peers has really accelerated over the past year. Is that what you've observed? And do you think it's still escalating? And how are you responding? Richard Galanti : I got to tell you, we in the last 12 months, we opened like 3% new locations. We had a 7%-plus increase in new members. So we're not finding -- we do a few promotional things, but I would say we have not increased the types of things we do at all. And you're right. At other places, there's not a day that goes by you can't get a deep discount, much deeper than we've even ever done on an ongoing basis. And so, no, we're not doing anything different. We're -- I mean, are we pleasantly surprised by the rate of new signups? Yes. It's nice to hear and have. And I think the fact that things like social media has helped us with the value proposition. And so, no, we're not doing a lot of things in that regard. Chris Horvers : And just from a technical question, what are your peers talks about tenure renewal rate? The 93% that you quote, does that include like the year-one renewal or anyone that comes to the door on one of those digital coupons? Richard Galanti : Yes. It does. And we've been doing the same way forever. Chris Horvers : Got it. Thank you very much and best of luck. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line Robby Holmes with Bank of America. Your line is open. Robert Holmes : Oh, hey, Richard. My congrats as well. You will be missed very much. Listen, just a quick question. I love the credit card rewards program. It's amazing. It's like the best thing that's ever happened to me. The Citi Card you guys do. Is there any issue or change with the late fees or anything going on that could change the rewards program or anything there? Richard Galanti : Well, that's the new recent headline of that's happening and we'll have to wait and see. Look, at the end of the day, it may change the economics. There are other levers that we've talked to them in the past, our issuing bank about what we could do, but nothing is done at this point. Robert Holmes : Got it. Thanks again and congrats on your retirement. Richard Galanti : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Laura Champine : Thanks for taking my question and wish you a long and happy retirement, Richard. It is -- I'm going to go out on a nitpick on the renewal rate. If renewal rate is flat overall, but 10 bps better US and Canada, that seems to imply it's not as good in international markets. Is that just some of the sampling that went on in China or what do you think might be driving that? Richard Galanti : Well, that's exactly what it is. When -- first of all, if you think -- if you just take the total number of members divided by total number warehouses, I think we're about close to 70,000 households per location. When we open a unit in, not only China, but other countries in Asia, we'll have anywhere from 80,000 to 150,000 members that sign up, many of whom we are looking to lose and a year later don't renew. We will start in some new countries with -- once the first batch renew for the first time, you might have a renewal rate in the 50%s or at best low-60%s. And then it just -- over the next four or five years, it continues to grow to something that's higher than that that's higher than that. That's more extreme than we saw 30 years ago in the US and Canada. But nonetheless, that's exactly what you see. So, when you're just opening the one unit in Shenzhen or whenever we open [Technical Difficulty] a year and a half ago in China, that's going to affect the international renewal rate. When we look at all other countries, when we look at the 13, the 11 other operations outside of US and Canada, their renewal rate generally ticks up a little bit every year, like the US and Canada. And US and Canada, by the way, has been helped also with increased penetration of executive members. We have that in several countries, but not all countries. The smallest countries, we don't have it in a number of units. And also with auto renewal, which has helped us in the last several years. And that's I don't believe everywhere. Laura Champine : Got it. That's helpful. Once those clubs mature, the clubs in China, other clubs, new clubs in Asian markets, etc., do they tend to -- can you serve a higher number of households there? Meaning, would you expect them to be sustainably above that 70,000 or so households that you have in an average club? Richard Galanti : Well, the answer is it is and it does. So, the answer is yes. Yes, I was at an open -- I was at -- two months after it opened in Osaka, Japan, back in October, and on a Sunday, a random Sunday was not there on business, but a random Sunday went over there. You couldn't move in the place. And it was -- and it was great. It was a wonderful picture to see. So, yes, I think that despite the fact that not everybody has cars and despite the fact that people have smaller housing arrangements, value plays well. Laura Champine : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jeffries. Your line is open. Corey Tarlowe : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats Richard on your retirement. As it relates to big ticket discretionary items, it seems like that category has improved a little bit. Just wanted to get a little bit of understanding as to what you've seen that's underlying that improvement in trend. And then secondarily on AI, just curious with the recent technology enhancements that the business has made, how you see that impacting the business on a go-forward basis? Richard Galanti : Sure. Well, in terms of big ticket discretionary, I think we completely believe that it's some of the things we're doing on our side to better explain the value. I mean, we -- it was almost like you did that and sales skyrocketed, 20% and 30% increases in some of those big ticket categories just over the last couple of months. Even if a piece of it is a year-over-year comparison, which I don't even know if it is or it isn't, at the end of the day, it was very evident to us. And the other comment I mentioned, particularly like on appliances, we're still a very, very small percentage of the total industry. And so it's easier to take market share when you're such a small percent of something. So, I think that'll continue. As regards to AI, we're just in the early innings of that. We've had third-party AI companies, large companies, including ones that are headquartered in Seattle, come out and talk to us. We -- where there's a whole list of things that we're doing with working with IT and our CEO and our heads of operations and merchandising to see where and how it might fit. So, that'll be a question for Gary in the future. Corey Tarlowe : Great. Thank you very much, and best of luck. Richard Galanti : Well, thank you, everyone. Again, it's been fun. The thing I miss most about the job is talking to everybody because I like talking. It's been a great story to tell, but it's been an absolute privilege and I appreciate it. So, have a good day and I'm sure we'll be speaking to some of you shortly over the next few days with additional questions. Have a good day.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco Wholesale Corporation Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Gary Millerchip, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Gary, you may begin your conference. Gary Millerchip : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. I'd like to start by saying how excited I am to be part of the Costco team, and it's a pleasure to be hosting my first Costco quarterly conference call. The whole Costco team has been incredibly welcoming. And as you might imagine, my first three months working alongside Richard have been a lot of fun. It's also been great visiting warehouses and facilities to immerse myself in the Costco culture and experience firsthand how this is positioning the company for continued growth. Over recent months, I've spent time and met with many analysts and investors, several of whom I know through my prior role. And it's clear you value and appreciate the company's current approach to investor communications. While I can't promise to be able to match the humor that Richard Galanti has become famous for, I can promise the same level of open dialogue and transparency you've come to expect. Oh, and to clear up some recent media speculation, I also want to confirm the $1.50 hot dog price is safe. Before I talk about our results, I wanted to mention that Ron Vachris is also join today's call. Many of you have expressed interest in hearing from Ron, and so we thought it would be a good idea to have Ron join the discussion and he can also take a few questions. Ron, would you like to add anything before we talk about the quarter? Ron Vachris : Thank you, Gary. And again, welcome to Costco. I'm very happy to report that the transition from Richard to Gary has gone very well and we're very excited to have Gary on board as part of Costco, and I look forward to working together on the growth opportunities ahead for our company. Before we jump into the quarter, I want to make a couple of comments on the leadership transition. As Richard has mentioned on previous calls, I've worked closely with Craig Jelinek for many years, including side-by-side for the last two years as President. And so the current CEO transition has been very seamless process. Since January, my time has been focused on working closely with the teams around the world to ensure we continue to deliver the best quality merchandise that are best value for our members. I'm incredibly proud of our employees and I believe our consistency of the results is a reflection of their commitment to our members and to each other. Consistent with how Craig and Richard manage investor communications, I intend to have Gary host the quarterly conference calls and I will join as business permits to answer a few questions. So Gary, let's go to the results and I'm happy to jump back in for the Q&A portion to field some questions today. Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Ron. I'll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. Comparable sales and comparable sales excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the 12 weeks ended May 12. Before I walk through all the numbers, new for this quarter, we are making available a slide presentation on our investor site under Events and Presentations. These slides summarize much of the information I will share today, including Richard's famous matrices. We intend to make this information available every quarter. Reported net income for the third quarter came in at $1.68 billion or $3.78 per diluted share, up from $1.3 billion and $2.93 per diluted share in the third quarter last year. Last year's results included a non-recurring charge to merchandise costs of $298 million pre-tax or $0.50 per diluted share, primarily for the discontinuation of our charter shipping activities. Net sales for the third quarter were $57.39 billion, an increase of 9.1% from $52.6 billion in the third quarter last year. The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year-over-year and comparable retail weeks. U.S. comp sales were 6.2% or 6% adjusted for gas inflation and FX. Canada was 7.7% or 7.4% adjusted. Other international was 7.7% or 8.5% adjusted, and this led to total company comp sales of 6.6% or 6.5% adjusted for gas inflation and FX. Finally, e-commerce comp sales were 20.7%, both on a reported basis and adjusted for foreign exchange. In terms of Q3 comp sales metrics, traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.1% worldwide and 5.5% in the U.S. Our average transaction or ticket was up 0.5% worldwide and up 0.7% in the U.S. Foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 20 basis points, while gasoline price inflation positively impacted sales by approximately 30 basis points. Moving down the income statement to membership fee income. We reported membership fee income of $1,123 million, an increase of $79 million or 7.6% year-over-year. Membership fee income growth was 8% excluding FX. In terms of renewal rates, at Q3 end, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 93%, up one tenth of a percent from Q2 end. The worldwide rate came in at 90.5%, the same as Q2 end. We ended Q3 with 74.5 million paid household members, up 7.8% versus last year, and 133.9 million card holders, up 7.4% year-over-year. At Q3 end, we had 34.5 million paid executive memberships, an increase of 661,000 since Q2 end. Executive members now represent over 46% of paid members and 73.1% of worldwide sales. Our reported gross margin rate in the third quarter was higher year-over-year by 52 basis points, coming in at 10.84% compared to 10.32% last year and up 54 basis points excluding gas inflation. Core was flat and higher by 2 basis points without gas inflation. In terms of core margin on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by 10 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin was lower 6 basis points and lower 5 basis points excluding gas inflation. This decrease year-over-year was driven by gas, partially offset by e-commerce. 2% reward was lower by 1 basis point, both with and without gas inflation with higher sales penetration coming from our executive members. LIFO was a benefit of 2 basis points. We had an $11 million LIFO credit in Q3 this year compared to no LIFO charge or credit in Q3 last year. This is the third LIFO credit this year following a $15 million LIFO credit in Q1 and a $14 million credit in Q2. And finally, other was higher 57 basis points or 56 basis points excluding gas inflation. This was all related to lapping last year's negative impact from the $298 million pre-tax charge for charter shipping activities. Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A rate in the third quarter was lower or better year-over-year by 15 basis points, coming in this year at 8.96% compared to last year's 9.11%. SG&A was lower year-over-year by 12 basis points adjusted for gas inflation. The operations components of SG&A was lower by 14 basis points and lower by 12 basis points, excluding the impact from gas inflation, despite an increase in warehouse wages this year. Higher labor productivity and great cost discipline by our operators drove the improved core SG&A results for the quarter. Central was better by 1 basis point and flat with our gas inflation. And stock compensation and pre-opening were both flat year-over-year. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $41 million this year versus $36 million last year and interest income and other for the quarter was flat year-over-year as lower interest income was offset by a foreign exchange gain in the quarter. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q3 was 26.4% compared to 26.5% in Q3 last year. Overall, reported net income was up 29.1% year-over-year, and excluding last year's charge related to the discontinuation of charter shipping activities, it was up 10.3% year-over-year. A few other items of note. In terms of warehouse expansion, in the third quarter, we opened two new warehouses, both in the U.S. Additionally, since the end of Q3, we had two more openings. Last week, we opened in Loomis, California, and two days ago, we opened our seventh building in China in the Nanjing market. For the remainder of fiscal 2024, we plan to open another 12 new locations, nine in the U.S, two in Japan and one in Korea. This would bring the total for the full year to 30 openings, including one relocation for a net of 29 new warehouses. Regarding capital expenditures, Q3 spend was approximately $1.06 billion, and we estimate full year 2024 capital expenditure will be between $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion. Diving a bit deeper into some of the key themes we saw during the quarter. Non-foods have the highest comps of our core categories. This strength was aided by lapping some softness in sales a year ago, but was really driven by our merchandising teams doing a great job identifying high quality items with values that really resonated with our members and buying those items with conviction. As inflation has leveled off, our members are returning to purchasing more discretionary items. And growth in the category was led by toys, tires, lawn and garden and health and beauty aids. Bakery sales also showed great momentum in the quarter as our fresh foods team has reinvented that department with a number of new and exciting items, including the Kirkland Signature Lemon Blueberry loaf and Morning Buns. Within our ancillary businesses, the food court had the strongest quarterly sales with continued success of the chocolate chip cookie that was added to the food court this year. On the inflation front, it's more of the same from last quarter. Across all core merchandise, inflation was essentially flat in Q3, with fresh foods close to zero and slight inflation in food and sundries being offset by some deflation in non-foods. The deflation in non-foods was led by hardware, sporting goods and furniture, all still benefiting from lower freight costs year-over-year. Keep in mind that when we speak to inflation or in the case of non-food deflation, we're referring to our selling prices. We're intentionally creating incremental value for our members by delivering lower prices wherever possible. We believe our strategy of delivering value to drive unit volume and member satisfaction is the winning combination for us. In that vein, our buying teams are constantly aware of changing costs across all of their SKUs and are ensuring that we are capturing all cost decreases quickly so that we can pass on incremental value through price reductions. If we are unsuccessful in delivering ultimate value with branded goods, we evaluate the potential for new high quality Kirkland Signature items with a goal of providing at least 20% value versus what we would sell the national brand item at. This quarter, we released a new Kirkland Signature men's walking shoe and new Kirkland Signature facial wipes, both of which are doing very well. We also reduced prices on a number of existing items, including lowering Kirkland Signature pine nuts from $29.99 to $24.99 and reducing the price of our Kirkland Signature frozen shrimp SKUs by $1. These are just a couple of examples that came out of our recent monthly budget meetings where each country and region shares new and exciting items they have introduced to their warehouses and items where they've lowered prices. Turning now to digital. We continue to make enhancements to the app and website and are excited about the traction that these initiatives are getting with members. Total e-commerce sales growth in the quarter was led by Gold and Silver bullion, gift cards and appliances. In appliances, Costco logistics is playing a key role in providing both greater value and a better end-to-end experience for members. Deliveries through Costco logistics were up 28% in the quarter. Costco Next, our curated marketplace also continues to grow nicely and we added eight new vendors in Q3, bringing the total to 75. Our app downloads were up 32% versus a year ago with about 2.5 million new downloads in the quarter, bringing total downloads to more than 35 million. Site traffic was up 16% and average order value was up 8%. You may have also recently seen an announcement that we are expanding our relationship with Uber. Previously, Uber Eats delivered Costco orders in Texas and this new agreement allows consumers the ability to order from Costco through Uber Eats across all of Canada as well as 17 states in the U.S. We are also working to expand this partnership to several of our international countries in the coming months. In addition to the increased access to Uber Eats customers, the agreement will allow us to sell Uber gift cards globally and offer discounted Uber One annual membership to Costco members. Finally, in terms of our upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending Sunday, June 2nd, on Wednesday, June 5th, after market close. Also, remember that our fiscal fourth quarter ending September 1, 2024, will have 16 weeks versus the 17 weeks in the fiscal fourth quarter last year. And with that, we will now open it up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simeon Gutman : Good afternoon. Hey, Gary, how are you doing? Gary Millerchip : Hi, Simeon. Simeon Gutman : We're going to take a stab at this membership question. The way that we've thought about it is it's an inflation offset to the model. And it was described as if you have enough levers in the middle of the P&L to deliver whatever stated EBIT growth you're trying to do, you didn't need to touch the membership fee. Is that still the way that you look at it? And is that visibility on enough levers still intact? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks, Simeon. And you're talking about a membership fee increase now. Is that where your question is coming from? Simeon Gutman : Right. Yeah. Yes. Gary Millerchip : Yes. I would really kind of revert back to some of the comments that Richard shared previously. I don't think that we're thinking about it any differently than he's talked about in the last few calls. We've historically looked at increasing the membership fee every five years or so. And obviously, we're beyond that time period now in terms of what would be the typical cycle. There's nothing about anything that we see within how the business is performing that's changing our view on that. We feel really good about membership renewal rates. We feel really good about the test of are we delivering significantly more value to members than we were or have since we last increased the membership fee. But I think we are our own probably toughest competitor and that we look at what's happened in the marketplace over the last few years and when we were seeing high inflation and the risk and concern around recession. We -- as I know before I joined the company, it was talked about extensively and it continues to be talked about as it's something that is still a case of when we increase the fee rather than if we increase the fee. But we are still evaluating those considerations to determine what the right timing is. And when we reach that point where we feel it is the right time, of course, we'll be very open and direct in communicating that. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Fair enough. Can I ask about your opinion on the U.S. expansion, it's been holding in a lot better. It's been more giving than we would have thought several years ago. Do you have any thoughts just your own perspective, you're probably looking at members per warehouse. Are you surprised at the runway you still have in the U.S.? You think it could be even more than what we're aware of today less? Just curious if there's anything surprising on that item. Gary Millerchip : I think it's only surprising in as much as I know we've talked previously about we thought that we would potentially run out of runway for new warehouses in the U.S. and as you know, this year we're opening close to 29 net new warehouses and many of those will be continuing in the U.S. and we still see significant runway to continue to opening more warehouses in the U.S. in the future. I think that sort of 25 to 30 new warehouse count is a reasonable proxy for what we think the runway is for the foreseeable future for new warehouses. And I'd be surprised if at least half of those weren't in the -- continue to be in the U.S. because we still see significant growth when we open those new warehouses. And what it's doing for us in fill in markets is it's creating capacity for our members that are shopping very busy warehouses today to be able to shop more frequently and drive more engagement with us and also it increases membership renewal rates over time as well. So I think we still see plenty of runway in the U.S. to continue to open more warehouses, but we also see a lot of growth opportunity, of course, in the international markets as well. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks, Gary. Appreciate it. Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Simeon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking my question. There's been a lot of announcements from consumable retailers in recent times about making price investments. Do you think you need to make a sizable price investment in the next couple of quarters in order to remain competitive? Ron Vachris : This is Ron Vachris. No, I think that this is part of our everyday DNA. I mean, we are competitive on a daily basis. Our buyers are on top of pricing daily, weekly and we all review them each month. And so we feel very good about where we are today and our runway to continue to be as competitive as we are moving forward. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is, given some of the changes in leadership over the last year or so, is there any thought given to being more aggressive with some of the evolution on the model, things like buy online pickup in-store, deploying more technology in the store or capitalizing on the ever so great amounts of data that Costco has in the form of trying to monetize it through retail media. Thank you very much. Ron Vachris : That's no -- and I think the answer to that is yes, on all those fronts. We are working on all those aspects. Right now, we're rolling out an expanded buy online pickup in warehouse that is always going to be limited in scope based on the volume in our warehouses that we have. We can't expand to all categories, but we're expanding as we currently speak in televisions and other electronic items that are there as -- and so yeah, we see that as a real opportunity for us. Technology is going to be one of our key priorities moving forward. How do we improve that member engagement and the relationship we have with them in our brick-and-mortar warehouses as well as online and through other aspects such as travel and so forth. So technology we see is a great opportunity to enhance the member relationship with Costco and also drive a lot more business for us as well as we move forward. So we're going to continually innovate. I mean, with the management changes, I wouldn't expect major changes as we have a proven strategy now. But as we've done for the past 41 years, we continue to innovate to the needs of our members. Oh, and the last on data, absolutely. We see a great opportunity for data. We have expanded our group there. We have a significant program now with retail media and we see some great upside potential. We've expanded that team and we see some good potential and some good runway for us in that as well, things like personalization and so forth. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much. Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. Chuck Grom : Hey, good afternoon and congrats again, Gary. And historically, Richard and team have been steadfast on the 14% to 15% margin ceiling, which has clearly paid dividends for the company over the years. I'm curious how you and Ron view this threshold you going to adhere to it? Do you think you can earn more? Just your thoughts on the margin front? Ron Vachris : No, that 14%, 15% has been part of our life for many years. And so I think that's -- our objective, our buyer's goals is really how aggressive they can get on pricing and deliver the best value. So I don't see there's no plans to move that cap at all. Gary Millerchip : And Chuck, maybe just one thing to build on that too. I think as you think about some of the opportunities that Ron mentioned on the earlier call, I completely echo Ron's comment about we have a really clear growth strategy that's obviously delivering momentum in the company today and these opportunities through technology and media, I think are great opportunities for us to find new ways to unlock value. But again, I think we see those very much in the mindset of how do we give 90%-ish of that back to the member, so that we're continuing to drive member engagement, member loyalty and member value. Chuck Grom : Great. And then just to kind of build off Michael's question, just wanted to get your high level thoughts on digital e-com. What do you think Costco's strengths are? What do you think the weaknesses are today? And where do you think the biggest focus is going to be for the company in the coming years? Ron Vachris : Our biggest strength on digital e-com is, of course, the merchandise and the value that we have. I mean that's what works for us in our brick-and-mortar. You know, the technology, the systems that we have, the teams have got a great roadmap of where they're going. A lot of the work that's being done right now is very foundational. So better fulfillment, quicker delivery times, the reliability of the site, those type of things. So those are the things. And then following that will come iterative changes of forward facing improvements that you'll see in the sites and move forward. So I think we've got a very good roadmap to do that. But I think that does -- it's -- I think personalization is a big deal for members that we could do a much better job on and also a better correlation of the warehouse and the online business. We're working towards warehouse inventory online. So members could use that in the app. But app functionality is one of our greatest opportunities. Chuck Grom : Great. Thank you. Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Chuck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Scott Ciccarelli : Thanks, guys. Scott Ciccarelli. So given the strength of your discretionary sales following the well that we've seen with -- as the economy got a little funky, does that suggest your members are starting to feel better and more willing to spend on wants rather than needs? Ron Vachris : Yes. It does indeed look that way. I've got to tell you that the discretionary spend we're seeing, I mean, we're definitely winning in consumables as we see the food business and dining away from home has softened up a bit and people are eating and we're seeing that in our fresh foods. But I have to tell you that categories such as the home division and toys are categories that have lagged quite a bit post-COVID that with great excitement, I mean, our buyers have come out and delivered some great items, have phenomenal values, have really rejuvenated those categories. And those are both leading categories for us in sporting goods, toys, furnishings, domestics, all those categories are really coming on very strong now and all of it discretionary in nature. Scott Ciccarelli : Fascinating. And then today, we had a presentation. Obviously, Ron, you joined the call. Are there other changes we could potentially expect given some of the C-suite changes? Ron Vachris : I mean, again, like I said, there's no major changes planned. The team is -- the team that's been running this company for some time. Gary has been a great addition to us and is contributing nicely. But our model is working. It's working around the world. Great value on quality merchandise seems to resonate in every region that we do business. So we'll continue to innovate. We'll continue to see new things and be relative to what our members needs are, but I can't sit here today and tell you to expect anything -- any great momentous changes in the near future. We just want to continue to actually execute well. Gary Millerchip : And Scott, maybe just to add from my perspective of being new to the role and new to the company, early observations to me, obviously, the incredibly impressed with the culture and the strategy is clearly working very well. So my first priority is to really being new to the company is to really acclimatize and to support and enable a smooth transition with the culture to make sure the momentum that we have continues going forward. And I think the other point, as we talked about a little bit earlier on the call is we're on a journey with technology and data. And so hopefully, there's things that I can bring to work with the team and help us continuing on that journey and accelerate that journey. And really that's the priorities in my mind being new into the CFO role. Scott Ciccarelli : Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Ron Vachris : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Kelly Bania : Thanks for taking our questions. And Ron and Gary, pleasure to have you both on the call and love the slides. Thank you. I wanted to just maybe go back a little bit to retail media strategy and personalization. I think, Ron, you noted a hire or maybe some key hires in that department. And Gary, I think you bring a unique perspective to this area or both of these areas. So I guess just can you help size up the opportunity for us on these two fronts in retail media and personalization? Is it at all different than a typical retailer because of Costco's unique model and SKU count or anything along those lines? And I guess, would that -- would your plans in these areas include any increase in technology spend in coming years? Gary Millerchip : Sure. Thanks, Kelly. Yeah, I'll go first and then Ron may want to add some color as well. I think many of your comments are relevant to how we think about the opportunity. And from -- the first thing I guess I would say as being new and having joined the company is as you think about where a lot of companies talk about alternative profit streams, there are a lot of areas today where Costco is doing great things in that area today. So using the strength of the membership relationship in driving a very large co-brand payment program that delivers value to members and delivers values to the company. The travel services business that we have, which is pretty unique in retail, but I think in any other company would be viewed as a way of generating new revenue and alternative revenue streams from sort of expanding from that overall retail relationship. And then thirdly, I would say we have media revenue today in areas of the business. So it's not as though it isn't something that actually the business is delivering on today. But I think as Ron mentioned in an earlier comment that as technology and data are something that we're sort of building a path towards, I would still say there's significant opportunity for us to grow in that space because of the unique nature of the relationship we have with our members and the ways in which we can deliver value for them and tap into that data and tap into the growth that we're creating both in the warehouse and through digital channels. I think it's a little bit early to sort of size it in totality because you're right, there are also some unique elements about our model that would make our opportunity a little bit different. But from what we know today and from the team that's been brought in to help the company think through it, we certainly believe it's got significant runway to drive a lot of growth for the company. And as I mentioned earlier, though, I would definitely think of it as something that we'll look at to as we do with everything, reinvest in the member to really accelerate the growth of the company overall. Ron Vachris : I would have to mirror what Gary says. We are -- we do have a unique model. We have a relationship with all of our members. Our responsibility is use that data wisely and respectfully. As far as IT spend, yeah, there will be some IT spend. We don't see as we look in the future, we don't see that to be anything that will really change our trajectory of our cap investments. But there will be some IT requirements, but we feel that will be in the normal course of business. Kelly Bania : Thank you. Ron Vachris : Thanks, Kelly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. John Heinbockel : So guys, I want to go back to personalization again. Where do you think just conceptually the biggest opportunities are, right? When you think about wallet share, every one of your members is going to be a little different, but you can probably do cohorts. Why are they not buying from you and why personalized promotions, outreach on new items coming into the warehouse. I mean, where do you think the biggest opportunities are to build further wallet share? Ron Vachris : John, I'll go ahead and start out. I think the biggest opportunity is, just like you said, the awareness of the warehouse and keeping our members in tune on what's active, what's going on in the warehouse near them and how we can continue to enhance and drive those sales. I think that that's probably our greatest opportunity with digital as we see moving forward. Personalization is good. We talk here a lot about a fair reasonable amount of personalization. We never want to compromise the treasure hunt of Costco. And that's equally as important as people that go to costco.com, never knew that they needed a 16 foot shed and they see a phenomenal value as they do in the warehouse. And so we don't want to personalize to a detriment, that changes our DNA and who we are. But we do know that there's definitely some improvements we could have that would enhance the member experience. And that's everything that our team is focused on is that how does this move to the member and how does it improve their experience with us digitally. John Heinbockel : Okay. Maybe -- and then as a follow-up, Gary, you talked a little bit about the core-on-core. But maybe you step back a little bit if you -- and I know the idea is not necessarily to maximize margin, but maybe some thoughts core-on-core this quarter and I know I think there had been pressure on fresh, right, as you kind of normalize post-COVID back to a regular level. Are we now through that process of fresh getting back down to a certain level? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks, John. Just maybe to give you a little bit more color on the core-on-core and how it kind of played out during the quarter. And so if you think about the three main categories in core between foods and sundries, fresh and non-foods, fresh would have continued to have been slightly lower year-over-year, and that's a very deliberate strategy for us to make sure we're delivering more value for the member, and we think that's a really important place for us to drive member engagement and support, especially as we're still seeing some commodities that are a little bit inflationary right now. So that would have been very much part of the plan from our perspective. But it was more than offset, as you mentioned by the improvement in non-foods during the quarter, which was what led to the 10-basis point improvement on core-on-core. Food and sundries actually was pretty flat overall. So we feel good about the way that we're managing the balance while staying true to that principle of delivering the best value for the member. And we were pleased with how it played out during the quarter based on the work all the merchandising teams did. John Heinbockel : Thank you. Gary Millerchip : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please go ahead. Peter, if you're on mute. Peter Benedict : Sorry about that. Yeah. Sorry about that, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Ron, maybe one for you. Just kind of back to the member behavior, maybe back to Scott's question a little bit. Can you just talk about maybe just your observations around maybe income cohorts, any other ways you bucket or slice your membership base, just how the behaviors have evolved here over the last several months. Is there any change that you think is interesting to call out? You talked about the better general non-foods trends. Just curious if this environment reminds you of anything else historically? That's my first question. Ron Vachris : Okay. It's a very healthy environment from what we see from our members right now. And as you take a category such as our meat department, which is growing very nicely. A lot of volume being driven in ground beef and our new everyday lower price on boneless skinless chicken breasts, really driving a lot of volume units there, while Wagu Beef and prime are growing at a great clip for us as well. So we're seeing that benefit from both sides of the consumer that great value in both areas are doing very well. The non-foods, I tell you that non-foods is strictly driven by newness and excitement and we see big and bulky going very well. It's been a year of our $1,200 swing set that we have on the floor. We can't get enough. They're just blowing out. But it's again that continuous innovation of merchandise that is exciting our members and really driving some sales force there. Executive membership continues to -- yeah, and that drives our executive base and because people are engaging at a much higher level. Peter Benedict : Sounds good across the board. But we're expecting a dryer to get delivered from Costco logistics on in the next couple of days. So looking forward to that. And then the second question would be, yeah, Ron or Gary, either one of you, just your view on vertical sourcing. I mean, this has been something that has been evolved in for several years going across different categories as you guys continue to grow your business, you need more, I guess, definable sources of supply. Just curious your view of vertical sourcing, where you are today, and what areas you might focus on over the next several years? Thank you. Ron Vachris : Sure. We have -- we've gotten into vertical integration and sourcing as the need arises. And if you think back in the infamous story about the hot dog and coke at $1.50 and how are you going to figure out how to keep that price there, while we're going to open our own meat plants. And as we looked at the prices of optical lenses going up and then we opened up our optical grinding plants. So we did that to continue to look at those things. The chicken plant came because we saw an inflection point where supply was not going to meet demand. So we had to get involved and because we didn't have a partner that was willing to expand into that area as well. There is a focus that I have a group focused on too is that let's not try and be everything though. Let's -- we've got a business to run here and we're not going to get vertically integrated just because it's something we can do. It really is going to be driven by where the needs are and when do you need to step in. It's equally -- we have great partners out there that supply our goods for us and they're long-term suppliers. And so it's strategically using that relationship is going to be the key in the future. So there's nothing that I could announce at this time that we're going to expand into, but we continue to keep that in our back pocket should we need to. Peter Benedict : Terrific. Thanks so much. Ron Vachris : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Brandon Cheatham : Hey, everyone. This is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. Thanks for taking our question. Recently, you were selling Instacart gift cards at a discount online and in warehouse and thought that was pretty interesting because it's potentially a gift card that could be used at a competitor as well. So I'm just curious, is there any strategy behind that? Are you trying to drive member engagement online and if there are any learnings from that initiative? Ron Vachris : You know the strategy behind it was another avenue to bring value to our members is really what that was about is that there is an upcharge on having grocery delivered to home. We work closely with Instacart, now we will with Uber to try and keep those costs at a minimum, but they've got people to pay on their side as well. So the partnership was really to how do we continue to enhance that service for our members and drive more sales. And so that was truly the -- yes, somebody can go out and use that somewhere else. But again, our job is to save the members where we can and be it airline tickets or Uber Drive tickets or Instacart shopping, we look at all those opportunities to add value to the member. Brandon Cheatham : Got it. Thanks. And my follow-up, how do warehouses react when you open an infill warehouse? Does it open differently than other new markets? Does the current market feel an impact? And how many warehouses that you opened over the past year would you quantify as infill versus new markets? Thanks. Ron Vachris : I guess how they react. We normally have good data before we'll open up an infill building and we can judge based on our member information what cannibalization will realize in what building. So we're able to get in front of that and adjust labor and payroll and buying and all those type of things for the upcoming cannibalization that we plan. And our team does a very good job. They're normally within a percent or so of what reality is to the execution of where our plans are as well. So we've gotten pretty good at planning those things out. And with -- it's strategic and the number of cannibalized locations I'd have to tell you, I'd have to say that we probably opened eight this year that cannibalized other buildings. Some may have cannibalized one warehouse, others may be in the middle and we had one in Toronto that cannibalized four buildings around it, but they've built back their sales within six months. So those are the opportunities where you know to Gary's earlier point, frequency improves significantly because members can get back into a high volume club. And so it's strategic cannibalization, if you would, as we look around the world. Brandon Cheatham : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. Ron, I wanted to follow up on the gross margin cap still very much in place at 14%, 15%. Is there any reason that SG&A now that it's back under 9% of sales couldn't fall to 8% if you keep having the growth that you have? Ron Vachris : No, that's a very fair -- that's a very good point. No, we continue to see -- I mean, the company, we had a very healthy SG&A number this quarter. Inventory was flowing very well. We had fresh goods coming through the system. Our warehouses did a phenomenal job. SKU counts are in line. And so it's one of those things where all the stars aligned and this is the way we operate well. When you can deliver that kind of a top-line growth at our size now, our operators do a tremendous job leveraging that to the SG&A. So what could that -- could that get to? I'd hate to say 8%, but I do think that we can have continued runway of driving down that number. Greg Melich : That's great to hear it. And on maybe some insight on gas gallons in the quarter. I know it was volatile and there's certainly a [indiscernible] pressure for a lot of members and consumers. Did that help the traffic acceleration in the quarter -- gas gallon growth? Ron Vachris : Yes. We were 5% up in gallons, you know. And again, that's -- I think all those things when you can save people on gas, that's also going to lend to your traffic as well. But gallons were up 5% for the quarter. Greg Melich : A great number. And I think a follow-up on gas. Is that still -- is the profitability in gas, Gary, kind of similar versus a year ago or last quarter or is that trending up or down? Gary Millerchip : Yes, the gas profitability would have been down a little bit. I think you may have heard me mention in the prepared comments that when we looked at the overall gross margin rate for the quarter and the sort of headwind that we had was in the ancillary businesses, the other businesses, and it was essentially gas that created that headwind. So we did see a reduction in gas profitability during the quarter, but overall, the core-on-core margin improvement and e-commerce improvement essentially offset that to bring us pretty close to flat overall when you adjust for gas inflation in the results. So it was down. I would say general, we've seen on gas profitability, it's been relatively consistent to slightly improving if you look over the last few years, but obviously, there are points in time when you think about volatility in fuel prices where you can have those ups or downs in any given quarter and that was -- this last quarter was one where we did see a headwind in year-over-year gas profitability. Greg Melich : That's fantastic. Well, welcome and I'll let somebody else ask about how much gold volume drove the comp. Take care, guys. Ron Vachris : Thank you. Gary Millerchip : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Rupesh Parikh : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So just going back to unit growth. In recent years, it's been stuck in that, let's call that mid 20s, it looks like this year will be closer to 30. Just want to get a sense of the opportunities to potentially accelerate that unit growth, especially in the U.S. just given some of your competitors are planning to accelerate growth from here. Gary Millerchip : You know it is a good risk. When you look at -- I talked before about managed cannibalization and when you do these infills and 29 locations is a solid number for us. As you start getting into infills, some of these projects take a little longer. It's a little tougher than there's not a whole lot of greenland out there for us to go in and open up a warehouse. So we have to do some creative things to find a way to infill in a very high market. International expansion continues to be strong. Some of the countries or regions that we do business in take quite a bit longer to get things done. So I think you'll see that ebb and flow. That number 25 to 29 or 25 to 30 is a good number for us. We feel good with our staffing and leadership and building out the infrastructure behind these warehouses. So we open with great solid support there. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And maybe just one follow-up question. So in terms -- you guys added Uber to a number of locations. So as you guys think about the intermediate to longer-term, would you expect multiple providers at all Costco U.S. stores over time? So maybe just more the rationale in terms of adding Uber and their longer-term vision? Gary Millerchip : You know we saw -- we were testing Uber for some time in Texas. We had the tests going on there and we did see a new cohort of members engagement that are on the Uber platform. Uber also allowed us to expand our international footprint too. So we're going to be out in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, UK and that we'll be expanding and where we don't have grocery delivery now. So there were some real benefits to that relationship, along with the long standing Instacart relationship that we had has been very good for many years. So we think that it does open up a window for us for some new member engagement and we also think that it's going to be very good for us internationally and expansion there as well. Rupesh Parikh : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horver with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Christian Carlino : Hi, good afternoon. It's Christian Carlino on for Chris. Could you speak to some of the innovation you're seeing in non-foods and anything else you think is driving some of the performance, particularly in discretionary categories. You called out toys, sporting goods and homes. So maybe any incremental color you can provide on those in particular? And while you're clearly gaining share, when you compare your own performance to some of the syndicated data out there, does the emerging newness suggest there's also somewhat of a rising tide in some of these categories that saw some pull-forward over the pandemic? Thanks. Ron Vachris : Well, yeah, I think if you look at -- if you talk about the home category and definitely is furnishings, which is one that was quite soft post-pandemic that has come back strong in furniture, those type of things. Then home decor, it's been some very unique items. I mean we've got 7 foot artificial trees that have come in and just exploded out and just blowing out of the warehouses and those are going at a nice clip. Domestics, the most unique items, Swedish dish towels, import items we're finding from around the world are doing very well. But it really comes down to unique items at great values that are exciting to members in all those categories. The housewares categories have been great. You know, sporting goods and toys, inflatable outdoor toys have been a big, big category for us as well. We've added the Kirkland Signature driver into our golf lineup that has -- that sells out as quick as it goes online. So we're seeing wins in several different categories. Christian Carlino : Got it. That's really helpful. And just broadly, are you seeing the competitive environment heat up in terms of peers investing in price, particularly in non-foods? You have some peers talking more and more about looking to drive units. Others are talking about a big step up in appliance promotions recently. So any color on what you're seeing competitively? Ron Vachris : Yes. There'll be ebbs and flows with the competition, but I'm very confident that we are always in the right position and we're staying ahead of that to keep the value there for our members. So these are -- those things are cyclical, but we're going to be a value every day. Gary Millerchip : And I think maybe just one thing to mention on that, Ron too, you mentioned it earlier, but with on the appliances, obviously, making sure we're always very competitive on price. But I do think the acquisition of Innoval Costco Logistics now and the value that we offer members there through both including the delivery and the insulation and the removal of the old appliance is proving to be a real differentiator for us on the member experience as well. Ron Vachris : Absolutely. Christian Carlino : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Please go ahead. Scott Mushkin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. And Gary, welcome. It's nice to be talking to you at Costco. And Ron, thanks for [indiscernible]. Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Scott. Scott Mushkin : I appreciate it. So my first question is kind of the opposite what everyone asks all the time around the fee. But given some of the stuff you've outlined around media and maybe driving the SG&A down, why do you need to increase the fee, right? Your sales are strong, your fee income growth is strong. So what -- just because you've always done it doesn't mean you should do it. So what would be the rationale behind driving a fee increase at this point? Gary Millerchip : You know fee increases go back to the members in lower prices. I mean that's -- it creates -- I mean and that's one of the key parts that we use that money for is that it allows us to broaden that distance from the competition and bring greater values than improving our operation overall for the member. So that's the primary focus. Scott Mushkin : Okay. And then my next question actually is kind of dovetails on the last one. But you guys talked about the consumer being a little bit better overall. And I guess what I was wondering is, is that really a Costco phenomenon? In other words, are you gaining share and that's what's really driving your improvements in some of these categories like electronics and appliances and big ticket rather than the consumer actually getting better. Is there any way to tease that out? Ron Vachris : I would say that that's very fair. We -- our merchants report monthly on industry trends in the country and/or internationally as we're seeing. And we can see our sales performance compared to the rest of market. And I would think that you're spot on when you say that we're gaining market share. Gary Millerchip : Scott, maybe one thing I would just add to is, I think we're all reading a lot about the consumer, of course and what they're going through right now. And I think what we see is that value and quality has never been more important. And so that plays to, as Ron described earlier, what we deliver, and we're making sure that the teams are laser focused on every day delivering that value and quality. And so I think we're drawing customers to what Costco has offer for many years and it's never more relevant than now based on what we're hearing from members and consumers. Scott Mushkin : Yes, we definitely like our Costco here at the Mushkin residence. So thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Ron Vachris : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Edward Kelly : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Edward Kelly : I wanted to ask you about maybe membership fee increase, but in a different way. And you just touched upon it a little bit about membership fee increase, right, just gets reinvested to your members. But can you talk a little bit more about how you think about the areas of reinvestment? I'm sure you probably have already done a lot of work around like where you would like that to go. Is there anything that's unique about where you know reinvestment might come to this time -- this time around just thoughts around that? Ron Vachris : It moves as time moves and you see pricing in categories and where we have the greatest opportunity to be more competitive for our members. And it may be in an area that if fresh foods is seeing some price inflation, we may invest more in the fresh foods departments for that period of time. The nice part about our model with 3,600 SKUs, 3,700 SKUs is we're still quite nimble as big as we are. So we can shift and based on the needs of our members and where we think the best investment in margin would take care of them. We're able to shift that thought process and then move it around. So I wouldn't say that there's any set, okay, if membership fee goes up, it's going to be spent in these areas. We work as a team and we continue to monitor it throughout the year and we act as needed. Edward Kelly : Okay. And just a quick follow-up on club throughput. I mean, it's remarkable how you drive up to a Costco club and it's hard to find a place to park, but yet you guys can still comp the way that you do. How are you thinking about throughput and ways to improve that? And I don't know if both buy online and pickup is part of that. How do you think about things like scan and go or maybe it's club density? Just curious as to how you solve for that over time. Ron Vachris : The part -- a good part of those is things like our e-commerce business and how we can -- how we can move out some of those goods out of the warehouse and move that business online. And as Gary spoke to, now that we have control over Costco logistics, we can bring great value to that experience as well. We continue to look at technology. We're testing some front door scanners that are going to -- they're speeding up our registers significantly when we get all the scanning and memberships are verified at the front door, it has shown a significant improvement in our register speed. And so that in turn turns over parking spaces much quicker. And so those kind of things along with strategic infills to help open up parking opportunities and gas expansions where those are needed as well. So there are several different levers that we'll continue to pull on how we can best serve the member in that building and where we need to make sure that we can look at throughput. Edward Kelly : Great. Thank you, guys. Ron Vachris : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Oliver Chen : Hi, Ron and Gary. You've done some really creative merchandising around UPTs and units per transaction with pickup items and innovation on that treasure hunt. What are your thoughts there? And also, big ticket and electronics, previously, previously, it was a bit of a drag. Just would love your thoughts on what you're seeing there. And third part is marketplace, the marketplace model and the concession model, and alternative inventory models. Just what are your views of opportunities there because they're really big ones and your member is so loyal to you as well. Thank you. Ron Vachris : On your UPT, you were asking about the transaction impact? Oliver Chen : I'm thinking strategically about adding units to people's baskets going forward and merchandising in that way as well if it's something you see in terms of an opportunity. Ron Vachris : Absolutely. We -- that's one of the big -- we were just in a session with our grocery divisions and talking there. And we've seen a great success in international foods that have been brought in to the U.S. and then of the like from the U.S. into the other regions of the world where we do business. But you want to take care of not only the consumables in the grocery side, but when we bring in an item that's a success in Taiwan or Korea or the UK and it creates that excitement for the member, that's when we really have done a good job of triggering that impulsive purchase where members are trusting the buyers and they will add that additional item to their cart. So that's been a big win for us. And again, it goes a lot of times with that treasure hunt. I mean, you've heard the plays, people come in to spend $100 and walk out with $300. That's because our buyers do and our operators do a great job in making the warehouses exciting and keeping those on the forefront of what they're -- when they come in and do their basic shopping, they pick up a few additional items that just compel them at the time. Gary Millerchip : I think maybe just to add on that, Ron too. I mean, the nice thing about the opportunity there for us is with trips up by 5%, that's really why the average basket size has been more flat recently and that's because we've been growing member engagement in consumables, as Ron mentioned, with food and fresh. And so it does present a great opportunity. And I think it also speaks to the team doing a good job of driving more frequency of member visits. So it creates a great opportunity for us to drive more of that basket size as well. Ron Vachris : And then your question on marketplace is a significant opportunity for us moving forward. I mean, we really do indeed see that. I think especially with our limited SKU count in the warehouse, how can we expand the offering to the members, bring value to their membership card beyond what's within our four walls or what's on costco.com and we see this as a great growth driver for us in the future and a way to bring expanded value to the members as we look forward. So I'm quite bullish on Costco Next and what that can become in the future. Gary Millerchip : I think the difference for us on that would be, of course, as we are with Costco Next is just being very curated for the member. So we're unlike a traditional marketplace that is about maybe just sheer volume for us, it's about making sure the member is getting something that truly is unique and valuable and being consistent to who we are, but it's tremendous upside opportunity there in that regard. Oliver Chen : Okay. And finally, on that big ticket question, would love any green shoots on electronics or TVs? And the last question on Asia, you have same day in China and you've done a lot of great things in the Asian region. Just would love any update there in terms of progress you made and the big opportunity for more end sales as well. Thank you. Gary Millerchip : Yes, I think just briefly on electronics, so we believe -- I think Ron referenced earlier, we look at a lot of the market data and we believe that we're winning with the member there in terms of the value that we're delivering and when we look at our trends versus the market. So we feel good about our ability to continue to outpace the market there and we're seeing a good opportunity within digital in particular to really drive more connection with the member and take some of those big ticket items from the warehouse to online as well. And in Asia, I think it would be consistent with what we've talked about with warehouses in the past that we think all of the markets offer us a great opportunity for growth. Some of those markets in Asia are more mature, but there's still significant opportunities to open new warehouses and fill in those markets. And then obviously, we have markets like China where we're really just sort of starting that journey, but there's tremendous growth opportunity as we identify the right path forward in that market. Ron Vachris : So the grocery delivery in China, we're up and going on six buildings we all just opened our seventh warehouse this week. That will start up this weekend. It's been a big win for our members. Its delivery within two hours is what is able to be done. And so we're seeing some good incremental shops initially out of that program, and we look forward to good things in the future on that. Oliver Chen : Thank you. Best regards. Ron Vachris : Thank you. Gary Millerchip : Thanks. Operator : Our final question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. Joe Feldman : Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking questions. A lot have been asked, but I do want to ask with Costco Logistics, what was driving that 28% increase, which is very strong? Was it new relationships with some of the other retailers or partnerships or just anything you could share on that would be helpful. Ron Vachris : Yes, that is other -- that is only -- we only deliver Costco members' orders through Costco Logistics. There are no partnerships going through those numbers that you see. We do a trace amount of series numbers, but that's not in any of the numbers that we report the growth in. That is just part of the past relationship that's there as well. And it is appliances, furnishings and outdoor were the three big drivers. Appliances were almost 30% growth for us in the period. And again, to Gary's point, it's that member value of the all in, what you see is what you pay price for delivery, installation, haul-away, everything you need done at one time that has really resonated with our members and has been a great driver of sales force. Gary Millerchip : Joe, I'll give you the practical example as a new entrant to the Seattle market. I just had Costco Logistics deliver two mattresses, three TVs and a couple of chairs as well for me. So that's the kind of stuff I think that we're seeing really resonate with members. Joe Feldman : Got it. That's great. That's great. Thanks, guys. And then just one other question. I know it's still relatively small, I think, but the Costco Next, is that sort of -- it seems like it's ramping nicely. I guess how will that continue to ramp in the future? Like where do you see that going and how important is that a driver? Like is that sort of the basis for this marketplace that Oliver was just asking about? Ron Vachris : As Gary mentioned earlier, Costco Next is a bit unique, but is it a fully curated marketplace. As there's many other marketplaces out there that are just for somebody to go on and sell goods on this marketplace. These are relationships that our buyers have with our suppliers and we're creating new suppliers as well. This has not only been a new way to sell goods, we've also found that we can find some really neat items that are selling through Costco Next that we in turn then bring into our warehouse. So it is a great testing ground for newness -- new items, a way to expand categories of accessories for certain categories that you have swing sets that we sell online, but you have additional swings and slides and other activities that you sell that we normally wouldn't be able to fit into a warehouse. So it really complements the core warehouse business, but gives us an opportunity to expand member value to these other partners as well. So we see a lot of upside there. Joe Feldman : Got it. That's great. Thanks, guys. Good luck with the fourth quarter. Gary Millerchip : Thank you. Ron Vachris : Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions in our queue. And with that, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco Wholesale Corporation Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Gary Millerchip, Chief Financial Officer. Gary, the floor is yours. Gary Millerchip : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Costco's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.

Now before we dive into our financial results for the quarter, I'm delighted to say that Ron Vachris is joining us for the call today. I'll now hand over to Ron for some opening comments. Ron Vachris : Thank you, Gary, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As we turn the page on fiscal year 2024, let me make a few comments on our progress during the year as a whole. Throughout the fiscal year 2024, we will continue to execute on our strategy of growing the top-line through delivering the highest quality goods at the lowest possible price to our members. As a management team, we continue to be incredibly proud of our 333,000 employees worldwide and the culture that they foster. The consistency of our financial results is a reflection of the commitment of our entire team to member service and the Costco experience. Most of these employees are led by our fantastic warehouse managers, who we view as executives in our company. Succession planning continues to be a key focal point for us, as we're continually working on identifying the future leaders of our company. In fiscal year 2024, we promoted 95 new warehouse managers. 85% of those promoted, started at Costco as an hourly employee. This promote from within culture and the long-term career it helps to build is core to who we are as a company, community member, and retailer. A few other highlights I'd like to mention. In fiscal 2024, we hit our target of 30 new warehouse openings. This included one relocation and resulted in 29 net new buildings. Highlights included our first-ever building in Maine, bringing us to 47 states, and our 600th US Building in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. We also continue to see significant opportunities worldwide, and our fiscal 2025 plan has 12 of our planned 29 openings coming outside of the US, including our fifth building in Spain, which opened in Zaragoza two weeks ago. With three of these warehouses being relocations, we expect to add 26 net new buildings in fiscal 2025. We continue to grow our e-commerce business, and Costco Logistics has had a remarkable year. Appliances and furniture in big and bulky has led the way, and Logistics delivered over 4.5 million items this last year, up 29% over the year prior. Improvements in our items sortment, delivery times, and scheduling functionality all enhance the member experience. We have great momentum with this business and expect big and bulky items will be a key part of our continued progress with e-commerce in the coming year. Turning to technology, we're starting to realize the benefits from the work that was done this past year. Members are very excited about being able to check warehouse inventory via the Costco app. And the membership card scanners installed at the front doors have delivered on the goal of speeding up the checkout process. This has been very well received by our members. More improvements are currently underway, which should further benefit our business both online and in our warehouses. With that, I'll turn it back over to Gary to discuss the results for the quarter, and I'll jump back on during Q&A to field some questions. Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Ron. In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the 16 weeks ended September 1st. As we did last quarter, we published a slide deck on our investor site, under Events and Presentations, with supplemental information to support today's press release. You might find it helpful to have this presentation in front of you as I walk through our results. Throughout this discussion, when we're comparing to last year's fourth quarter, the best way to normalize for the extra week is to multiply last year's results by [16-17] (ph). Net income for the 16-week fourth quarter came in at $2.354 billion, or $5.29 per diluted share, up from $2.16 billion and $4.86 per diluted share in the 17-week fourth quarter last year. This year's results included a non-recurring net tax benefit of $63 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, related to a transfer pricing settlement and true-ups of various tax reserves. Reported net income was up 9% year-over-year. Excluding this year's non-recurring tax benefit and normalized for the extra week, last year, net income and earnings per diluted share were up 12.7% and 12.6% respectively. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $78.2 billion, an increase of 1% from $77.4 billion in the fourth quarter last year. Adjusting for the extra week last year, net sales would have been up 7.3%. The following comparable sales reflect comparable locations year-over-year and 16 comparable retail weeks. US comp sales were up 5.3% or 6.3% excluding gas deflation. Canada comp sales were up 5.5% or 7.9% excluding gas deflation and FX. And other international comp sales were up 5.7% or 9.3% adjusted. This all led to total company comp sales of plus 5.4% or plus 6.9% adjusted for gas deflation and FX. Finally, e-commerce comp sales were up 18.9% or 19.5% adjusted for FX. In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, foreign currencies relative to the US dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.9%, while gasoline price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.6%. Traffic or shopping frequency increased 6.4% worldwide and 5.6% in the US. Our average transaction, or ticket was negative 0.9% worldwide and negative 0.3% in the US. This includes the headwinds from gas deflation and FX. Adjusted for those items, ticket would have been positive 0.5% worldwide and positive 0.6% in the US. Moving down the income statement to membership fee income, we reported membership fee income of $1.512 billion, an increase of $3 million, or 0.2%, on one less week year-over-year. FX negatively impacted membership fee income by 0.9%. Excluding the impacts from the extra week last year, and FX normalized membership fee income was up 7.4%. In terms of renewal rates, at Q4 end, our US and Canada renewal rate was 92.9%, down one-tenth of a percent from Q3 end. This slight decrease related to an online membership promotion that we ran for a short period in fiscal year 2023, which resulted in over 200,000 new sign-ups. As those members entered the renewal rate calculation during Q4 fiscal year 2024, the lower renewal rates for that cohort, which is typical for digital promotions, had a negative impact on the overall US renewal rate. Outside of those sign ups, there were no meaningful changes in the US renewal rate. The worldwide rate came in at 90.5%, the same as Q3, with improvement internationally offsetting the slight negative in the US. We ended Q4 with 76.2 million paid household members, up 7.3% versus last year, and 136.8 million cardholders up 7% year-over-year. About half of new member signups in fiscal year 2024 were under 40 years of age. This percentage has been growing since COVID, and has lowered the average age of our member over the last few years. At Q4 end, we have 35.4 million paid executive memberships, up 9.6% versus last year. Executive members now represent 46.5% of paid members and 73.5% of worldwide sales. Turning to gross margin. Our reported rate in the fourth quarter was higher year-over-year by 40 basis points, coming in at 11% compared to 10.6% last year and up 33 basis points, excluding gas deflation. Core was lower by 5 basis points and lower by 11 basis points without gas deflation. In terms of core margins on their own sales, our core-on-core margins were higher by 9 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses' gross margin was higher 44 basis points and higher 42 basis points, excluding gas deflation. This increase year-over-year was driven by gas and e-commerce. E-commerce benefited from strong sales growth, item mix, and fulfillment productivity. And gas margins benefited from some moderate tailwinds and lapping a slightly weaker quarter last year, but nothing as significant as the benefit in Q1 2024, as a result of the volatility from world events in that quarter. 2% rewards was higher by 4 basis points or 3 basis points without gas deflation, reflecting higher sales penetration from our executive members. And LIFO was a benefit of 5 basis points. We had an $8 million LIFO credit in Q4 this year compared to a $30 million charge in Q4 last year. Moving to SG&A. Our reported SG&A rate in the fourth quarter was higher year-over-year by 8 basis points, coming in at 9.04% compared to last year's 8.96%. SG&A was higher by 2 basis points adjusted for gas deflation. The operations component of SG&A was higher 4 basis points, but was flat excluding gas deflation. Higher wages went into effect for the last six weeks of the quarter in the US and Canada, which was a headwind for the quarter of approximately 4 basis points. Investing in our employees remains a key part of our strategy, and we will continue to focus on driving top-line sales and improving productivity to mitigate the incremental costs. Central was higher by 3 basis points and 2 basis points without gas deflation. Stock compensation was flat year-over-year, and pre-opening was higher 1 basis point but flat without gas deflation. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $49 million versus $56 million last year, reflecting $1 billion of debt paydown in the second-week of Q4 this year. Interest income for the quarter was $138 million versus $201 million last year, primarily due to the $6.7 billion special dividend paid in January 2024. Interest income will continue to be a headwind in the first half of this year due to lower year-over-year cash balances and lower interest rates. FX and other was an $18 million loss this year versus a $37 million gain last year. This was primarily due to foreign exchange. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q4 was 24.4%, compared to 27.1% in Q4 last year. As mentioned earlier, this year's rate benefited from $63 million of net tax discrete items. Adjusted for this benefit, the tax rate for the quarter would have been 26.4%. Turning now to some key items of note in the quarter. We opened 14 new warehouses in the fourth quarter, 10 in the US, 2 in Japan, and 1 each in Korea and China. Capital expenditure in Q4 was approximately $1.58 billion, bringing the total year spent to $4.71 billion. Taking a deeper look into core merchandising sales, once again, non-foods led the way with the highest comparable sales in Q4. Our buyers have done a fantastic job finding new and exciting items at great values. Golden jewelry, gift cards, toys and seasonal, home furnishings, tires, and housewares all were up double digits in the quarter. Health and beauty aids also performed well, as we have expanded and elevated that category with new high-end SKUs, both online and in warehouse, including assorted luxury fragrances at a 30% to 70% value to retail. Across the fresh departments, we saw high single digit growth, as our continued focus on value is resonating with our members. An example of this in the meat department is our Kirkland Signature boneless chicken tenderloins, where we lowered the price 13% and saw a 21% lift in pounds sold. In food and sundries, the introduction of more international food products such as paneer cheese, Punjabi cookies, and fried tofu kimbap are resonating extremely well with our members. We're also delivering greater value by adding some new Kirkland Signature items, such as our KS Organic Golden Maple Syrup and KS aerosol whipped cream. Kirkland Signature offers significant member value compared to the national brands and continues to grow at a faster pace than our business as a whole. Our goal is always to be the first to lower prices where we see the opportunities to do so. And just a few examples this quarter include KS Standard Foil, reduced from $31.99 to $29.99, KS Macadamia Nuts, reduced from $18.99 to $13.99, KS Spanish Olive Oil, 3 liter, reduced from $38.99 to $34.99, and KS Baguette 2-Packs reduced from [$5.99 to $4.99] (ph). Our commitment to sustainability and achieving lower emissions is also presenting opportunities to lower our costs. A great example of this is our KS laundry packs, which we recently converted from a rigid plastic tub to a pouch. This allowed us to reduce the plastic packaging by 80% and pass these cost savings onto the member, lowering the price by $1 from $19.99 to $18.99. We've also found success working with suppliers to localize production of bulky items, such as water, paper, and laundry detergents. By manufacturing these goods closer to the countries in which they're sold, both costs and emissions associated with the shipment of these goods are greatly reduced. This quarter, we introduced our new Japan-produced Kirkland Signature paper towels. In addition to the emissions benefits from no longer shipping millions of units of paper towels from the US to Asia, the reduced freight allowed us to lower the price by approximately 30%, or $8 per unit in that market. As production ramps up, we are in the process of transitioning our other Asian markets to locally produce skews. Shifting the production country of this one product will result in annual member savings of $30 million. Within ancillary businesses, pharmacy have the strongest sales percentage increase, driven by double digit growth in script counts. Our optical department also performed well, as more members have taken advantage of the exceptional values in brand name frames and sunglasses. On a like-for-like 16-week basis, gas sales were negative low single digits in the quarter as a result of the average price per gallon being 5% lower. This was partially offset by gallon growth of 3%. Inflation was once again effectively flat in the quarter across all core merchandise. Food and sundries and fresh foods were slightly inflationary and this was offset by deflation in non-foods. In the supply chain, we are seeing good flow of products through Panama and Baltimore. The Red Sea is a remaining pain point and is causing some relatively minor shipping delays. Product availability has generally been good with a few exceptions. Egg supplies are still being negatively impacted by avian influenza and prime beef and a handful of vegetable SKUs have been tight. As Ron shared earlier, we are pleased with the momentum in our digital business and continue to make good progress with our technology priorities. Our app was downloaded 3.5 million times in the quarter, bringing total downloads to approximately 39 million, and we recently upgraded the native search function on our US mobile app, leading to a doubling of the click-through rate on search results. E-commerce traffic, conversion rates and average order value were all up year-over-year, helping to drive another strong quarter of comparable sales growth. While continued strength in bullion, was a meaningful tailwind to e-commerce comps, appliances, health and beauty aids, tires, toys, gift cards, hardware, housewares, home furnishings, optical and pharmacy all grew double digits year-over-year. The rollout of buy online and pickup in warehouse for TVs in the US market was also completed in Q4. This allows same-day pickup of a new TV for members who prefer not to wait for delivery. While buy online pickup in warehouse isn't cost effective for us on lower-priced items, for high-value items with high shipping costs like TVs, the freight savings more than offset the added labor, required in warehouses to fulfill those orders. We're now testing a similar program on laptops. Costco Next, our curated marketplace, while still small, continued to grow nicely in the quarter. We added 11 new vendors, bringing the total to 86 and adjusting for the extra week, gross sales grew nearly 40% year-over-year. A brief comment on the membership fee increase that went into effect on September 1. Due to deferred accounting, this will have minimal impact early in the year. The vast majority of the benefit will come in the back half of fiscal year 2025 and into fiscal year 2026. With that being said, our commitment to invest in our employees and members is continuous as evidenced by the July wage increase and lower prices such as the example shared on today's call. In closing, we are encouraged by our momentum exiting fiscal year 2024 and are excited about the growth opportunities ahead as we continue to execute our strategy of delivering exciting new items and greater value for members, innovating with Kirkland Signature and growing our warehouse footprint and digital capabilities globally. In terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our September sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, October the 6th on Wednesday, October 9th after market close. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now open the line up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simeon Gutman : Questions. On the previous earnings call, there was a discussion about the possibility of greater SG&A leverage in the future as a lot of foundational investments have already been made shortly after Costco announced a membership fee increase and reinvestment into employee wages as well. While wage investments are clearly the right thing for the business and instrumental for Costco's culture and success, how should we reconcile this potential posture of driving more leverage but also adopting the same prior approach of putting upside back into wages. Gary Millerchip : Hi, yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. As we think about our overall model for the company, our focus is on really achieving a balance across the business. And as you know, over the years, what we've done successfully at Costco is, continue to invest in members, continue to invest in lowering prices and value for our members and continuing to invest in our employees. And we believe that's going to be a critical part of our overall strategy going forward to make sure that we keep driving our top-line sales growth. You're absolutely right, during the quarter. And in fact, I think 3 times during the year, we shared -- we made various investments in our employees back in September 2023, we announced an increase in the starting wage. And then in March this year, we announced that we were increasing wages for a number of our managerial roles in the warehouses. And as you mentioned, we recently announced a further increase for all of our hourly employees in the warehouses and across our distribution network. And so from our perspective, we think that's an important part of continuing to support the top-line growth in the company. As you saw in the quarter, when you adjust SG&A for gas deflation and for looking particularly at the operational part of the business, the good news was we were able to effectively offset that cost -- those cost increases by driving productivity and driving sales leverage. And I think we've done that pretty consistently over time. And our expectation of ourselves is that we'll continue to do that. So I think for us, it's less about giving specific guidance on a particular measure but more looking over the long term of how we expect to be able to keep making those investments, but also driving leverage in our model to ensure we're sustainably driving top-line and driving profitable growth. Ron, anything you'd like to add? Ron Vachris : No, I have to agree with you, Gary. Simeon Gutman : Got it. That's really helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, can you speak to the impact of the card readers at the different stores you've rolled out so far? Should we be modeling potentially a lift in member counts or growth in addition to the MFI bump from the fee increase as well? Ron Vachris : This is Ron. The purpose of the card readers at the front door, this is a system we've been using for over two years now in Europe and especially in the UK and we've piloted here in the US for about six months. Several different benefits for it. It gives our operators real-time traffic counts throughout the day. So we're able to adjust front-end lines that we need to open and close lines based on the fluctuations of business. We can monitor our fresh foods a little better because we know what the traffic counts look like and so forth. And it has also taken the friction of membership verification away from the front-end registers and move that to the front door, where we're able to look at people's membership status. We let them know if their renewals is due before they get to the front-end. So we've realized some very nice, healthy front-end improvements in productivity, and it's allowed our operators to manage the business much better throughout the day. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Horvers : Thank you. Good evening. I\u2019m going \u2013 hopefully you can hear me. The question is can you talk about the risk around the port strike that's emerging here. What percentage of the product do you -- comes through those defected ports. Any description on maybe the categories that are more exposed versus the others? And to what extent have you tried to bring in product early for the holidays to try to manage that risk? Ron Vachris : Yes. This is Ron again. Yes, I'll take that question. The port strike is something we've been watching very closely for some time. We knew about the timing of this as well. When you think about the impact to our business, we import primarily nonfoods and some limited food and sundries come in, but nonfoods is less -- about 25% of our total business and only a subset of that is important. There's some domestic goods in there as well that are not imported in nonfoods. We have done a little bit of everything that you spoke about. We've got contingency plans, we've cleared the ports, we've pre-shipped. We've done several different things that we could to get holiday goods in, ahead of this time frame and looked at alternate plans that we could execute with moving goods to different ports and coming across the country if needed. It could be disruptive based on how impactful, I can't tell you until we know length and what could happen out there. But it is in our sights. Our buyers are all over it. They're watching it closely, and we've taken as many preemptive measures as we could to prepare for this. Chris Horvers : And then just as a quick follow-up. As you think about the risk around ocean freight rates, is your expectation that freight rates are maybe elevated right now because of all this and perhaps come down into next year as we think about contract renewal periods? Thanks. Ron Vachris : I'm not good at predicting the future, but I can tell you that from what we're seeing a big chunk of our freight comes in under contract. So we've been insulated from that. The spot market has peaked in the last quarter. We see that coming off now. If a port disruption could happen or something else could happen in the Red Sea, could that go up? Absolutely, it could go up. But from what we're seeing now, the spot market did increase is coming off at this point. And again, our team did a great job by insulating us with good solid contracts for this year. Chris Horvers : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. Chuck Grom : Thanks. Good afternoon, Gary and Ron, just to go back to the membership card scanners. Can you just speak to where you are on the rollout of that across the US? And any positive reactions you've seen so far? Our checks have shown that in some locations you guys are actually seeing a double-digit increase in new sign-ups. Ron Vachris : Yes. We have about 350 US warehouses rolled out at this point and through the process, reaction has been very positive. Myself, all our operators, and we really rely on feedback of our warehouse managers and what's been done. And our head operator, Russ Miller, and myself have been met with great positive reactions both from the members and from the operators as well. We have seen some lift in member sign-ups from that. We have also seen a lift in renewals because before people get to the front end, now they're aware that my renewal is going to be due when I get to the registers, so members are very appreciative about that. They know that and they get up to the front, and they're not shocked by that process as well. So improved productivity, improved interaction. And as we know, as our volumes grow, we're looking for everything we can find to use technology to help get our members through the front ends in a good, smooth manner. Chuck Grom : That's very helpful. And then my follow-up, just, Gary, on the other business line and within the margin build up 42 basis points ex-gas. Can you add a little bit of color on the sequential change? How much came from e-comm or how much came from the improvement in gas margins? Thank you. Gary Millerchip : Sure. Yes, we called those two out because they were the two biggest factor in the results. I think of them as being relatively similar in terms of the impact. E-commerce actually has been a nice trend that we've seen for the last couple of quarters. We've been really pleased with the momentum in e-commerce. Of course, the headline sales growth has been very positive, which is a great starting point. But then the team's done a really nice job of improving fulfillment, efficiency and driving better sell-through in terms of the product and the inventory management as well. And the mix has improved. As I mentioned, on the prepared remarks, we've seen really good growth, really a balance across the board around e-commerce growth. So e-commerce has been a sort of a sustained trend that we've been pleased with the last couple of quarters. On the gas side of things, it was really -- I wouldn't say there was anything unusual during the quarter. It was really more a case that we had a little bit of tailwind in margin. And as I mentioned earlier, we're cycling some lighter margin in the same quarter in 2023. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Brandon Cheatham : Hi, everyone. This is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. Thank you Gary and Ron. I want to talk about new store growth. You mentioned 26 net in 2025, with I guess, an increasing focus on international. Anything you can share on why the US would step down from 24 levels? Should we think about international being a more important growth vertical for you? And then on the US side, how many of those are new markets versus infill where you're trying to alleviate traffic congestion from a nearby store? Ron Vachris : On the international to domestic new openings, it really is based on timing through the system. I mean, in larger markets, we may have a building that's taken us three years to get to fruition, where some markets move quite quickly. So there is no specific plan that we have. We put the buildings in queue. We agree that we're going to go there. And then it's following the process all the way through to how utilities come along, infrastructure, those types of things. As far as the outlook on international versus domestic growth, it's pretty balanced, again, more of a timing thing than anything. I think we've got 12 next year that will be outside of the US. And we've got some -- you could imagine in some countries, it takes us a few more years to get a building opened up. So it really is about the cadence of them opening. But we continue to look forward that we feel pretty good, balanced growth. We see infills as being very positive for us, both in US, Canada and all of North America that we have plenty of opportunities for infills in North America for the next several years ahead. And then a good market of new regions of the world. I don't think we have anything lined up for next year but new markets. I'd say that we're probably looking at 5 to 6 new markets that we'll be expanding into next year. Brandon Cheatham : Got it. Okay. Thanks. And just one follow-up on the [MFI fee] (ph) increase. I know you all typically reinvest in the member experience and price. And I think we already talked about wages. How should we think about the timing of that? Because you realize the MFI fee increase over a longer period? Is there any near-term pressure that might flow through the P&L as you do kind of focus on delivering that value to the member after you've increased that fee? Gary Millerchip : Sure. Yes, thanks for the question. We mentioned a couple of these things in the prepared comments, too, but we certainly think about as we increase the membership fee, our goal is always to find ways to deliver more value for the member. And we think about that pretty holistically. It can be lowering prices. It can be launching new Kirkland Signature products. It's also investing in ways that we can improve member experience and some of the things that Ron mentioned earlier. And we believe a critical part of delivering a better experience for our members is also in employee wages. So we very much look at it holistically and how do we make sure we feel confident that we are delivering more value to our members over time. And some of those things that you heard in Q4, we've already started that journey with some of the wage increases and some of the ways in which we've been able to lower prices and deliver more value through new Kirkland Signature products in the quarter. To answer maybe the broader question that you mentioned, as you know, we generally don't provide guidance as part of our updates for the results of the company. That being said, I would say, overall we feel very good about our momentum ending fiscal year '24. And as we head into the new fiscal year, we feel very good about the opportunity ahead of us. As always, we've set ourselves high internal expectations for how we expect to grow the top-line and to do so profitably. And we'll be doing that by continuing to invest in member value and employees while driving efficiencies and leverage. And we still see many opportunities to find ways to improve gross margin and SG&A in terms of opportunities to fund those investments. We wouldn't normally comment on cadence for the year ahead either. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there are a few unusual items this year with the deferred accounting for the membership fee increase, as you mentioned. And that will generally sort of really the most part of that will come in, in the second half of 2025 and the first half of 2026. And then there were also a couple of specific factors to Q1, namely the interest income, where we'll be cycling higher cash balances and higher interest rates from last year and gas profit, while it is really been pretty stable over the years, there was certainly some volatility due to world events in Q1 last year. So the one thing I think I would say is that as you think about our cadence of our earnings growth across '25, it's likely to be less linear than you would probably typically expect. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. John Heinbockel : And Gary, I wanted to start with -- I think you said right, core-on-core was up 9 bps. What was the color by product category of fresh foods, sundries and non-food? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Food and sundries were slightly negative. Fresh was slightly positive and non-food was the strongest of the three, which was really, again I think, from the mix perspective and the strong sell-through in the year, but that was sort of the breakout of it, John. John Heinbockel : And then maybe second for both of you guys. How do you -- when you think about Kirkland Signature, you talked about -- you gave some price decreases that you've taken and all of those that you cited anyway were Kirkland Signature. So maybe talk about that, those price decreases maybe versus brand name product. Where Kirkland signature penetration is now? And is that business because you're getting scale -- is that just becoming a lot more profitable than it used to be or you're trying to manage to a flatter -- an unchanged margin on Kirkland Signature? Ron Vachris : I guess I'll take that one. We continue to see the penetration grow. And it's in the high 20s now as it continues to grow as our penetration across the board goes. We are not only seeing investment in price in Kirkland Signature. But with Claudine and her team, they have a commitment that if we're going to expect that of our suppliers, we're going to start with setting that example and showing the benefits of investing in price and driving unit volume. So we are doing that, but we are also seeing great support from our suppliers and our partners around the world. That are also interested in driving their business and using Costco as that partner to get that done. So we continue -- I think we've got some great items coming up this next year in Kirkland Signature that will continue to enhance that value proposition to our members and continues to build the loyalty with our members because this is a place you come to get Kirkland Signature. So we see good things coming. We see the penetration continue to grow, and we continue to see the value and the benefits to the members improving over time. Gary, if you would --. Gary Millerchip : Yes, maybe, Ron, just to add to the comment also, John, you were asking around the margin opportunity. Obviously, we stay very disciplined about -- we have a cap on the margin that we expect to make on a Kirkland Signature product. But as that mix continues to grow, it definitely creates some overall tailwind in our margin overall. And I mentioned a couple of examples in the prepared comments. We're also seeing some really great opportunities as we're thinking more globally across our merchandising team is really working together and finding ways to buy more efficiently and in-country production that we mentioned. So when you take all those combined, I think that's creating opportunity for us to win-win in the sense that we can create more value for the member, stick within our commitments around the margins that we work within, but I do think it creates tailwinds and ways to balance the investment in the member while continuing to grow long term. John Heinbockel : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Scott Ciccarelli : Hi, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Another question on the ID scanning. Any feel for how often nonmembers were shopping at Costco? And then secondly, just given some of the price reductions that you highlighted earlier, can you comment on your broader inflation and deflation expectations for fiscal '25? Thanks. Ron Vachris : As far as the scanning, I really couldn't give you a number. I mean, we've been exclusive for -- since the inception of the company that we're exclusive to members. There are shop cards and those type of things that people come in with. But I really couldn't give you a set number of what percent of people coming in are non-members. And as far as inflation, I think Gary is signing, that he'd like to take that one. Gary Millerchip : Yes, happy to. Probably similar to Ron's comment earlier, I don't know we would be particularly good at telling you what we forecast for the market overall, but what I can maybe give you some a little bit more color from what we're seeing, Scott from our perspective, we shared for the quarter overall inflation was essentially flat. We saw a little bit of inflation in fresh. That was mainly driven by produce right now. That was sort of the key category there that drove -- but again very low inflation, nothing meaningful to talk about. We're still seeing it very quiet in terms of the inflationary impact on prices and on the business. Food would have been slightly inflationary as well, but it's a remarkable actually how a small range now between the different categories, really nothing between positive 2% and negative 2% and sort of all coming back out to even just very slightly inflationary. But nothing much there either that we're seeing. We are seeing more of a mixed view on commodities. Things like corn and flower and sugar are all deflationary, which is causing the bakery category as a whole to be deflationary. But then on things like butter and cocoa and eggs, as I mentioned earlier on the call, and cheese, we're seeing more inflation. So I don't know that we're seeing anything today that's causing us to believe that where we are today is what the world looks like. And our goal, of course is always to find ways to lower our costs and therefore, hold prices down for our members. So I wouldn't say that we are seeing anything dramatically different from how our quarter looked for this quarter. But of course, like everybody we're susceptible to shocks and changes that can happen in the market. Scott Ciccarelli : Helpful. Thanks a lot guys. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] on for Michael Lasser. Thanks very much for taking our questions. While it's early, what has been the customer response to the MFI increase? And do you expect to see a rise in customer attrition? Why or why not? Thanks. Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks for the question. As you are familiar with the membership fee increase, we were very deliberate about the timing. In fact, we are really delayed by 2 years from when we've traditionally increased the fee every 5 years and that was initially because of what we thought our members were experiencing with COVID and then we saw higher inflation. So we were very deliberate in delaying the increase until we felt that we started to see inflation dissipate and our members were spending more in non-food categories seeing that they were coming through the inflationary period. From a member reaction perspective, I'd say, we haven't really heard a significant member reaction. Our membership renewal rates. There's no real change in trend, as I mentioned in some of my prepared remarks. I think the fact that we've been able to stave off inflation on things like the hot dog pricing at $1.50 and the rotisserie chicken at $4.99. And generally, demonstrating the way that we're lowering prices for members wherever we can. I think there's been a recognition that in the context of what's happened more broadly over the last seven years that we stayed true to our principles of really trying to help the member and deliver the value. And as we mentioned earlier on the call, we\u2019ve been making investments, whether it be in wages for our employees in lowering cost to show our members that we want to make sure that the increase is delivering value to them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So just on the consumer front, just curious how you guys are feeling about the health of your consumer? And then any changes in consumer behavior of note during the quarter? Gary Millerchip : Sure. Thanks, Rupesh. I think we see the consumer or member through a course through our lens. And what I would say is that it is very clear that quality and value have never been more important. That's something that has very clearly coming through in our insights and how we're seeing our members shop. I think the encouraging thing for us is, as you know, as you look at our trends in the year-to-date, we have seen that as inflation has dissipated, our members have started to spend more on non-food items, which is really encouraging in our mind. And what we're really pleased about is the widespread nature of that across the different categories that we've seen in non-foods. I would say that on some categories like appliances and electronics, definitely, they've become more promotional over time. That would be a factor, I think, that members are looking for more deals. And for us, of course, we are always going to be there on price, but we also include within what we're offering to our members, the installation and the removal of the old product, if that's necessary in the delivery. So we kind of trend to try and differentiate there on the overall experience as well as being a great everyday low value. I think they're the kind of key trends in non-foods. On the food side of things, we've definitely seen some signals that would suggest that members and consumers in general are maybe shifting a little bit of spend from food away from home to food at home. Under the food and the sundry side of our business, alcohol would still be relatively soft. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing really strong growth in our ethnic food categories and also in Kirkland Signature products, particularly in the new ones that we've been introducing. And then on the fresh side of things, really strong growth across meat, produce and bakery. I would say we've certainly seen a continued acceleration in some of those lower-cost protein items like poultry, cheaper cuts of beef like ground beef and pork. So there is definitely some signs that the consumer is being very choiceful in how they are spending their dollars. But thankfully, with the quality and value that we're offering is definitely resonating with our members. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. Big focus out there on alternative revenue streams, including media. Just curious on the latest on the efforts from Costco. And is there more -- is there maybe a more aggressive push in growing that area? Gary Millerchip : Yes. I think we still see it as a significant opportunity. It\u2019s definitely a journey for us. It\u2019s the foundations of that journey are getting our technology infrastructure in a position where we feel really good about the capabilities that will allow us to deliver to the member in terms of the offers that we can give to them and the level of targeting and personalized capabilities that creates. We\u2019ve already started to build out those plans and starting to identify how we can capture low-hanging fruit where there are opportunities. But we would see it as a significant opportunity over the long term, to drive new revenue. We will approach this probably a little bit differently than many others \u2013 we\u2019ll be reinvesting the vast majority of those dollars as we always do to drive top line growth. And we think that will be a competitive advantage with our CPG partners because it will show them that every dollar they\u2019re spending is really intended to drive overall growth for the company. That being said, I do think it will help also with e-commerce business is typically less profitable, on this case, a way to offset some of those costs in delivery and fulfillment as well. Rupesh Parikh : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Kelly Bania : Hi, good evening, Gary and Ron. Just wanted to ask about e-commerce, obviously, continued strength there. Just can you just give us a broad update on the penetration, the profitability and how that is impacting margins at this growth level? And just an update on what the penetration would be if you included Instacart, like others do in that penetration? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks, Kelly. As we look at the progress, we're really pleased with the momentum that we've seen in digital. Actually, we were looking at the data recently over a 10-year period, and we've grown our compounded annual growth rate in e-commerce, it's been over 20% for that 10-year period. So it's been a significant growth story for us and members clearly evaluating the additional ways in which we're giving them opportunities to find new deals and value for the member. Overall, it would be -- the penetration will be in the sort of high single-digit range based on how we report e-commerce today. If you kind of -- to your point earlier, we don't include some of those digitally started sales transactions, if I could say it that way. So Instacart, Uber, the ways in which members might be buying groceries and food and sundries. If you added those in, and of course, we also include gas in our total sales, we would be into the double-digit penetration when you include all those elements in the number. Kelly Bania : Okay. And any comments on profitability and how that's -- how e-commerce is impacting profitability? Gary Millerchip : Yes. I would still say it's marginally, it's lower than the traditional shopping in the warehouse, and that's obviously intuitively makes sense given that we're doing more of the picking and shopping for the member. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we have seen some good improvements as we've grown our sales numbers, that's created some leverage in the model. We\u2019re improving the efficiency of our fulfillment costs. So it is continuing on an improving trend over time because of the sales growth and the leverage that\u2019s creating, but also some of the improvements the team are making in the business to drive more efficiency as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Michael Baker : Great. Thanks. Two questions. One, can you talk about competitive pricing, particularly in grocery. There's been a lot of talk about some grocery chains investing in price, et cetera. What are you seeing how your price gaps? And then I'll have a follow-up after that. Thanks. Gary Millerchip : Yes, thanks for the question. I think the key thing for us is we're our own biggest competitor. As you heard us mention earlier, we want to be the first to lower prices and the last to raise prices. And at every one of our regular budget meetings, we're talking about how can we find ways to do that. And the majority of our price investments are proactive, not that we're reacting. But of course, we're always watching and staying very close to competition. I would say that the promotional environment has been increasing. That would be with us, as Ron mentioned earlier, that our CPG partners are investing to find ways to drive units, and that would certainly be the case across some of the competition as well. I mentioned earlier, appliances and consumer electronics would be an area where we've seen more of that activity. But I think if you took it all on balance, we wouldn't say that we're seeing the activity sort of outside of normal in the food space. And we feel very good about our position relative to the market and continue to be proactive in finding ways to provide the best quality, best value for our members. Michael Baker : Excellent. That makes sense. Follow-up when gas prices fall, I think gas prices are down now 15%, 16% year-over-year, broadly speaking, at least in the latest data. Does that hurt your traffic at all? Because I think you guys say 50% of people will come to get gas -- come into the club and buy something, I think the unit growth -- the gallons growth did decelerate a little bit this quarter. Is that something that you guys look at or have any concern over? Ron Vachris : Yes. This is Ron. I don't see it as a concern. Gallons were up 3%, which was a little bit softer than the prior quarter. So when you do hit those peaks in prices, we will see a greater attraction to the Costco gas stations. But our balance of transactions, dual transactions that we have looks very positive. And so we're not seeing traffic dropping off at all in the warehouse based on the slightly softer gallon growth that we're seeing out in the gas stations. Michael Baker : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Karen Short : Hi, thanks a lot. And good to talk to you again. So thanks for taking my question. So my question is, when you look at your pre-tax margin, I know you don't manage to that in any way, shape or form. But it obviously has been creeping up. So when you look at the actual delta on a 10 basis point increase in that margin, it's not immaterial to get to earnings and/or valuation, obviously. So wondering how you think about that. Gary Millerchip : Hi, Karen, I think the way we think about it is really back to some of the comments that we were referring to earlier is that our goal is always to drive top line. That's the top priority for the company, and we're focused on investing and delivering value for the member and delivering improved investments in our employees as well to make sure that we're an employer of choice. I think I appreciate the comment because I think, we have been successful over the years in doing that because there are ways for us to continue to lower our costs in our gross margin part of our business and drive more value for the member. Some of the things that we've been focused on, like global buying and the Kirkland Signature growth that we've seen, e-commerce growth, as we mentioned earlier. And there will be opportunities for things like Retail Media in the future. So I think there are a number of ways in gross margin and also a number of ways in SG&A where we can continue to be more efficient to drive that investment. Our focus is always to drive, as I mentioned, the top line and if that, over time, allows us to continue to grow the margins, then obviously, that's something that we're pleased with, and it's a good outcome for our investors. But I wouldn't say, as you mentioned, it's a targeted outcome. It's really about making sure that we're driving that top line growth and the history, as you've mentioned, would suggest that when we've done that well as we continue to look for opportunities, it has allowed us to expand margin slightly as well. Ron Vachris : I agree with Gary. I would add to that, there are several levers that our operators and our buyers have to improve margin. And our buyers speak often about the fact that we can lower prices while improving margin as well. And that comes with the efficiencies that we're seeing, comes with very good sell-throughs that we're realizing in the goods that we're buying, newness and bringing in new items to the market that that could have a little bit better margins. And our operating shrinkage has been improving. And we saw a nice solid year this year and picked up some margin on improving shrink results in the business as well. So those are some different levers that will augment lowering prices and continue to improve margins. Karen Short : But is it fair to think that 4%-ish maybe going up from there is realistic? Ron Vachris : Yes, Kare, I think we wouldn't get into it, as you know, into sort of guidance of what we're expecting in the future. I do think, as Ron shared, that we don't see it as -- a if you like, a zero-sum game. I think we believe there's an opportunity to continue to find ways to invest in our members and our employees, and we do believe you can do that through the way that we manage the business to continue to improve profitability over time, but I wouldn't want to really provide any specific guidance related to that. Karen Short : Great. Thank you. Ron Vachris : Thanks Karen. Operator : Laura Champine from Loop Capital. Your next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. I want to go back to the profitability and gross margin, particularly gasoline, the tailwind. What -- are we now back at $0.20 of penny profit per gallon? Or what should we think of that as sort of a normalized range going forward? Gary Millerchip : Yes. I think, Greg, we generally aren't sharing specific breakdown of profitability, and that would be true obviously across a number of areas of the business. But on gas, as I mentioned earlier, I would think of gas as being sort of fairly stable in general for us. There are peaks and troughs because of volatility in the market in the short-term sometimes. I wouldn't think of this quarter, while it showed up in -- as part of the overall improvement in other businesses, I wouldn't call it out as being like anything that was particularly changing the trajectory of gas or that would cause us to be wanting to share any more sort of detailed color because generally, we're expecting the gas side of the business to be relatively stable. As I mentioned, next quarter -- this quarter, I should say, that was an example of where there was some really very unusual volatility because of world events. But in the main, I would think of gas as not being a major sort of underlying change in trajectory or something to look at differently in our model. Obviously, we do provide color where there is something unusual that pops up, but I wouldn't think of that as being a directional change. Greg Melich : Got it. And given the recent wage increase, could you help level set us, so maybe on what your average wages are now in the US or globally? I think in the past, the number was something like $26 an hour? Ron Vachris : No. Currently, the average wage is just north of $30 an hour. Greg Melich : Just north of 30%. Great. And that's for the US? Ron Vachris : Yes. US and Canada [Equivalent] (ph) in Canada. Go ahead. Greg Melich : So my last question was just given the nonfood, the success there. You called out the gold bullion Boeing again. I'm just curious, are there any plans to maybe bring Kirkland Signature into the gold bullion market? Ron Vachris : No plans at this time. Greg Melich : All right. Thanks a lot and good luck guys. Ron Vachris : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that's all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the conference back over to Gary for closing comments. Gary Millerchip : Thank you, Krista. Thank you all for joining the call today, and we look forward to talking to you at the next quarterly earnings call. That will conclude our call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

Ron Vachris : Thank you, Gary, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As we wrap up the first quarter of fiscal 2025, let me make a few brief comments on some of the highlights since we last spoke in September. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we opened seven new warehouses. This included one relocation and resulted in six net new buildings, of which four were outside of the US. Additionally, after the end of the quarter, on the day before Thanksgiving, we opened our 897th warehouse in Pleasanton, California. That opening had the highest ever opening day sales for a US warehouse at $2.9 million that day. We continue to project 29 openings during fiscal year 2025, of which three will be relocations, and so 26 net new buildings. Ten of those warehouses will be outside of the US. Gary will speak to a more detailed review of our results in a few moments, but I wanted to share some fun facts regarding our growth across the business. Our US bakery division has reached new records of 4.2 million pies being sold the three days prior to Thanksgiving. In our US food courts on Halloween Day, we set a new record of 274,000 whole pizzas being sold. That was an increase of 21%. Our US pharmacy business has prescription growth exceeding 19% for the first quarter, setting new volume records for that business. And lastly, we continue to gain market share with our e-commerce big and bulky fulfilled by Costco Logistics. Costco Logistics completed nearly one million deliveries in Q1, and over 196,000 deliveries last week alone. That was a new record as well. The majority of these deliveries were completed in four days from the members ordering their merchandise online. All of these milestones reflect the continued strength of our business across the membership offering. These great results are a reflection of the outstanding work done by our over 330,000 employees around the world. Their commitment to our company and the Costco experience for our members is truly inspiring. I'd like to thank all of our people for their outstanding work this year and especially during the busiest time of the year. As we approach our annual shareholders meeting in January, I also wanted to mention that our annual update to the Costco sustainability commitments was just made available online today. This report provides a comprehensive review of the progress we're making towards our sustainability objectives, and I would encourage all of you to take a look. With that, I'll turn it back over to Gary to discuss the results of the quarter. And I'll jump back on during Q&A to field some questions. Thank you. Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Ron. In today's press release, reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the twelve weeks ended November 24. We have once again published a slide deck on our investors.micron.com. You might find it helpful to have this presentation in front of you as I walk through our results. Net income for the first quarter came in at $1.798 billion or $4.04 per diluted share, up from $1.589 billion or $3.58 per diluted share in the first quarter last year. This year's results included a tax benefit of $100 million or $0.22 per diluted share related to stock-based compensation. And last year's results included a tax benefit of $44 million or $0.10 per diluted share, also related to stock-based compensation. Excluding these discrete tax items, net income and earnings per diluted share grew 9.9% and 9.8%, respectively. Net sales for the first quarter were $60.99 billion, an increase of 7.5% from $56.72 billion in the first quarter last year. US comparable sales were up 5.2% or 7.2% excluding gas deflation. Canada comp sales were up 5.8% or 6.7% adjusted for gas deflation and FX. And other international comp sales were up 4.7% or 7.1% adjusted. This all led to total company comp sales of 5.2% or 7.1% adjusted for gas deflation and FX. Finally, e-commerce comp sales were up 13% or 13.2% adjusted for FX. In terms of Q1 comp sales metrics, foreign currencies relative to the US Dollar negatively impacted sales by approximately 0.3% while gas price deflation negatively impacted sales by approximately 1.6%. Traffic or shopping frequency increased 5.1% worldwide and 4.9% in the US. Our average transaction or ticket was up 0.1% worldwide and 0.3% in the US. This includes the headwinds from gas deflation and FX. Adjusted for those items, the ticket would have been up 2% worldwide and up 2.3% in the US. Moving down the income statement to membership fee income. We reported membership fee income of $1.166 billion, an increase of $84 million or 7.8% year over year. Membership fee income growth was also 7.8% excluding FX. Remember that the recent membership fee increase doesn't have much impact yet, due to the effects of deferred accounting and represented less than 1% of the fee growth in the quarter. In terms of renewal rates, at Q1 end, our US and Canada renewal rate was 92.8%, down one-tenth of a percent from Q4 end. The worldwide rate came in at 90.4% also down one-tenth of a percent primarily due to the US and Canada. As we mentioned on the last quarterly earnings call, our renewal rates are seeing some impact from higher growth in digital sign-ups, which renew at a slightly lower rate than our base as a whole. Underlying renewal rates and membership growth remain strong, but this mix shift is likely to have a continued effect on our published renewal rate for the remainder of 2025. Gary Millerchip : We ended Q1 with 77.4 million paid household members, up 7.6% versus last year. And 138.8 million cardholders, up 7.2% year over year. At Q1 end, we had 36.4 million paid executive memberships, up 9.2% versus last year. And executive members now represent 46.8% of paid members and 73.1% of worldwide sales. Turning to gross margin. Our reported rate in the first quarter was higher year over year by 24 basis points, coming in at 11.28% compared to 11.04% last year. And up 7 basis points excluding gas deflation. Core margin was higher by 31 basis points and higher by 17 basis points without gas deflation. This was driven by mix and our credit card co-brand program. In terms of core margins on their own sales, our core on core margins were higher by 3 basis points. Ancillary and other businesses' gross margin was lower by 12 basis points and lower by 16 basis points ex gas deflation. This decrease year over year was largely due to gas partially offset by e-commerce. The 2% reward was lower or better by 5 basis points, 6 basis points without gas deflation. And LIFO was flat for the quarter. We had a $19 million LIFO credit in Q1 this year compared to a $15 million credit in Q1 last year. Moving on to SG&A, our reported SG&A rate in the first quarter was higher year over year by 14 basis points, coming in at 9.59% compared to last year's 9.45%. SG&A was flat adjusted for gas deflation. The operations component of SG&A was higher or worse by 15 basis points and higher 4 basis points excluding gas deflation. Higher employee wages that went into effect in July drove the headwind for the quarter, partially offset by sales leverage and productivity gains. As always, investing in our employees remains a key part of our strategy, and we will continue to focus on driving top-line sales, improving productivity to mitigate the incremental costs. Central was higher or worse by 5 basis points and 3 basis points without gas deflation. Stock compensation was lower or better by 2 basis points and 3 basis points without gas deflation, and preopening costs were lower or better by 4 basis points both with and without gas deflation. Below the operating income line, interest expense was $37 million versus $38 million last year. And interest income was $96 million compared to $154 million last year. As mentioned in our Q4 earnings, interest income faced headwinds in the quarter due to lower cash balances, subsequent to our special dividend in January 2024 and lower interest rates. This will continue to negatively impact year-over-year comparisons in Q2. FX and other was a $51 million gain in Q1 this year versus a $6 million gain last year. This gain offset much of the headwind we saw in interest income in the quarter and was primarily due to FX. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q1 was 22% compared to 24.5% in Q1 last year. As mentioned earlier, this year's rate benefited from a $100 million discrete item related to our annual RSU vesting. Adjusted for this benefit, the tax rate for the quarter would have been 26.5%. Turning now to some key items of note for the quarter. Ron talked earlier about our continued momentum with new warehouse openings. And capital expenditure in Q1 was approximately $1.26 billion. We estimate CapEx for the full year will be approximately $5 billion. Taking a deeper look into core merchandising sales, Fresh led the way in Q1 with comparable sales of high single digits. Meat was up double digits and demonstrated strength across the department, with members continuing to purchase high-ticket premium cut selections and others gravitating more towards lower cost per pound options. As always, our focus remains on delivering exceptional quality and value across every item we sell in fresh. Our non-foods category was also up high single digits, despite some impact from the calendar shift. As our buyers continue to bring in new and exciting items at great values, gold and jewelry, gift cards, home furnishings, sporting goods, health and beauty aids, luggage, kiosk, and hardware were all up double digits. This quarter, we were able to add several new high-quality brands across a broad range of categories, including Peloton, Wrangler, Springfree trampolines, and Ruggable. Food and sundries had mid-single-digit comps with our cooler and frozen food departments leading the way. We continue to see strong momentum with new and exciting international food items, such as Saneer Pork Soup Dumplings, Sona Missouri rice, and hot pot beef sliced chip rolls. Kirkland Signature continues to grow at a faster pace than our business as a whole. Our goal is always to be the first to lower prices, where we see the opportunities to do so. And just a few examples this quarter include Kirkland Signature organic peanut butter reduced from $11.49 to $9.99, Kirkland Signature chicken stock from $9.99 to $8.99, and Kirkland Signature Sauvignon Blanc from $7.49 to $6.99. Our merchants are also driving innovation with Kirkland Signature, most notably this quarter, we introduced new Kirkland Signature oxy powder, and Kirkland Signature food storage bags, both offering significant value to the national brand alternatives. Within ancillary businesses, pharmacy had the strongest sales growth. Our focus continues to be on keeping prescription and OTC prices low, while also leveraging technology to make it easier for our members to use our pharmacy. Recent examples include the introduction of new prescription inventory management software to better stay in stock, enabling delivery of prescriptions via Instacart. Our food court and optical departments also performed well in the quarter. Gas sales were negative low double digits due to the average price per gallon being down low double digits. Costco travel is another way we deliver unique membership value and these services continue to resonate well with our members. We offer a wide range of vacation packages, car rentals, cruises, hotels, flights, and other travel-related services. And in addition to highly attractive rates, many of our offerings include a Costco shop card as extra value for booking with Costco. A couple of fun facts about our travel business. Last year, we sold enough rental cars to fill every US Costco parking spot 8.5 times. We also offer great value to members on cruises. And our largest cruise booking last year was a 150-day around-the-world cruise, starting from Fort Lauderdale and making stops in places like the Galapagos and Easter Islands. The total price was $293,000 for two, in the owner's suite cabin, and added value on the booking included a shipboard credit of $13,000 and the Costco shop card worth $25,000. Members who use Costco travel spend approximately twice as much as members that do not use these services. Inflation was once again essentially flat in the quarter across all core merchandise. Food and sundries and fresh foods were slightly inflationary and this was offset by deflation in nonfoods. In the supply chain, while egg suppliers have been negatively impacted by avian influenza and the recent East Coast port strikes led to a spike in paper and water product demand, overall product supply is generally being good. The predictability of on-time shipping delivery remains below pre-COVID levels, and items are generally spending more time on the water. Our merchants have adapted well to this change, and we are in a great position with inventory for the holidays. As we head into Q2, we continue to monitor potential port strikes in India, the East Coast, and Canada. And our merchants are adapting plans as necessary to ensure we remain in stock for our members. Turning to digital and e-commerce. We continue to make progress with our technology roadmap and enhancements made to the member experience like the ability to check warehouse inventory via the Costco app, are resonating well. Our US app was downloaded 2.9 million times in the quarter, bringing total downloads to approximately 42 million. E-commerce traffic, conversion rate, and average order value were all up year over year, helping to drive another strong quarter of comparable sales growth. While strength in volume was a meaningful tailwind to e-commerce sales, hardware, sporting goods, gift cards, and home furnishings all grew double digits year over year. As Ron mentioned earlier, Costco Logistics also had another great quarter driving growth in big and bulky items. And Costco Next accurate marketplace achieved record sales over the Thanksgiving Black Friday, and Cyber Monday sales period. In closing, let me provide a brief update on retail media. To use a baseball analogy, we are very much in the early innings with retail media. But we continue to believe this represents a significant growth opportunity in the future. This quarter, we completed our first targeted media campaign through third-party media channels with one of our largest CPG partners. The campaign achieved two to three times the return on ad spend typically expected, highlighting the value we can create for our members and suppliers. Our retail media team is now working with over 25 suppliers who are eager to participate in our next wave of off-site campaigns. And finally, in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five weeks ending Sunday, January the fifth, on Wednesday, January the eighth after market close. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open the line up for questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll now begin the question and answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one a second time. If you are called upon to ask your question and are listening via speakerphone on your device, please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. To be able to take as many of your questions as possible, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Again, it is star one if you would like to join the queue. Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Hi, everyone. I hope you can hear me. My one question with a couple parts. Actually, diagnosing the health of the consumer. Can you give us some sense of how you're clearing some of the seasonal inventory, maybe apparel, bigger ticket? And then once in a while, we talk about market share in some discretionary categories. Can you share your perspective on that? Thank you. Gary Millerchip : Sure. Thanks, Simeon. And, yeah, we can hear you well, and thanks for the question. So maybe taking that question in a few parts. As we look at the consumer, I think we're seeing a lot of similar trends that we've talked about in the last few quarters. What we're seeing with our members is that now, probably more than any time in recent history, that combination of newness of items, quality, and value are really important to the member. And we're seeing the member being very choiceful about how they're spending the dollars. All that being said, I think we're finding that as our merchants are doing a great job of finding that newness and quality at great value, we've seen some great strength in our nonfood categories and certainly, as you heard me say in the prepared comments, we're seeing really strong performance across many of the categories around things like gold and jewelry, gift cards, home furnishings, sporting goods, health and beauty, hardware, all up double digits during the quarter. So we're pleased with the momentum that we're seeing there, and I think it reflects the fact that our members are willing to spend as inflation comes down as long as those sort of three key ingredients that I mentioned are there for the member as well. I think in terms of overall what we're seeing with the member on food and grocery, I would say that we are seeing what we think is a little bit of a shift from food away from home to food at home, and that's certainly reflected in strong meat and produce sales that we've seen in our own business. We are seeing, I think, a little bit even more of a trend that we've talked about in prior quarters of bifurcation with the member where we have high-quality premium cuts. They're selling well. But we're also seeing a gravitation towards those lower price per pound items across categories like poultry, cup cuts of beef, and pork as well. Ron, would you like to add? Ron Vachris : Yeah. I guess, Simeon, another part of your question seasonal sell-through appears to be very strong. It's a unique retail calendar with the shorter period of time after Thanksgiving, but our buyers have been through this before and they've responded properly with that as well. So that feels good. Seems to be a very foundational Christmas, though. As you see, furniture driving a lot of our e-commerce sales, appliances, sporting goods, hardware, and so just people are very, very basic buying this year, but good trends. Gary Millerchip : And I think, Simeon, I guess I didn't mention specifically, we tend to focus on our member and how can we deliver that great value. The data that we do see would tend to suggest that we're growing our share across most of the categories that I mentioned. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with T. B. Cowen. Your line is open. Oliver Chen : Hi, Ron and Gary. Happy holidays. Their traffic continues to impress a lot. As we look forward, what are your thoughts and key drivers and mix opportunities as you think about ticket and UPT? Also, you highlighted retail media, which is a huge great opportunity. How does that intersect with your important multi-vendor mailer and also as you think about the incrementality of that opportunity, that would be great to hear. Thanks. Thank you very much. Gary Millerchip : Yeah. Thanks, Oliver. I think the first part of your question, you've probably heard in some of the comments that we made that we have been pleased with the traffic that we've seen and the continued frequency of shop from our members. What was nice to see at the end of last quarter, we did see when you adjust for foreign exchange and gasoline that we started to turn positive on the items per basket. And then this quarter, when you adjust for those items, we're up about 2% on the US and 2% worldwide. So we have seen some improved momentum on the items per basket, and I think that's a lot of great work being done by, again, our merchants making sure that we've got great product offerings in the warehouse and then our operators really executing those campaigns exceptionally well when the members are in the warehouse as well. From a media perspective, I think we look at it very much as an incremental opportunity. Our goal is to continue to maximize the value we can put into everyday product quality and pricing. And where we're seeing a lot of the interest in retail media is really coming from the marketing agencies, which gives us a lot of confidence that this is an opportunity for us to tap into new. A lot of our national brand suppliers are going to those media agencies to invest those marketing dollars to really make sure they're getting a good return on that ad spend. And so where we're seeing a lot of the traction and again, I would emphasize it's very early days with retail media for us. It's something that we're just really embarking on that off-site journey. But really where most of the interest is coming from is from retail media agencies, which we believe is the way for us to make sure that we're driving incrementality and growth in the model. Oliver Chen : Thank you very much. Very helpful. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. Good evening, guys. So can you talk about what drove the core on core margin performance this quarter? You have the MFI now rolling through. How do you think about, you know, reinvestment of price either, you know, in terms of price reductions that you see coming down the supply chain or maybe even going above and beyond that? And just as a side question, can you define what's in the hardware category? Is that consumer electronics? Thank you. Gary Millerchip : Sure. Thank you for the question. Yeah. In terms of the core on core margin first of all, which I think was the first part of your question, if you break it down between the sort of three main categories that we see within the business, that's Foods, Fresh, and Nonfoods. Foods would have been essentially flat. Nonfoods would have been down slightly, and Fresh would have been up slightly. So those three kind of, you know, obviously, overall, we were just up three basis points. So there really wasn't a tremendous amount of change overall, but they would have been the sort of key puts and takes in the overall number. Ron Vachris : And then the description of the hardware category really is just that. It's storage, plumbing, lighting, power tools, batteries, those types of household goods that you would find at a typical hardware store. Christopher Horvers : And then on the price investment side, your thought process there? Ron Vachris : That's something that we've done for the history of the company. We're going to continue to invest in price and some of it may come in holding certain prices as some commodities are starting to increase. But if investing in items like Gary described, I'm leading with Kirkland Signature. I mean, we feel that we're gonna be asking our members and our vendors to contribute with lower prices. We've got to set that example and start with Kirkland. So we're gonna continue to look at those opportunities and invest where we can and keep driving sales. Christopher Horvers : Thank you. Have a great holiday season. Ron Vachris : Thank you. You as well. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jiang Ma with Bernstein. Your line is open. Jiang Ma : Thank you for taking my question. I have a two-part question. One, I think Gary you mentioned the difference in renewal rates from online sign-ups and then offline sign-ups. Can you help us break it out and understand the difference in online behaviors? And the second part on the retail media side, how do you expect Costco Connect to the third-party marketplace to contribute to the growth of retail media going forward? And will that impact the membership loyalty in any way or regard? Thank you. Gary Millerchip : Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question. So first of all, on the membership rate, you know, I'd maybe take a step back and just say overall, we're feeling very good about the underlying membership metrics that we're seeing. So renewal rates in general, sign-up activity, and then the membership growth remains very strong. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, really what we're seeing is that over the last few years, we've seen some shift in more of the members that we're acquiring coming through digital channels. And that's helping with the comment that we made last quarter where we're also seeing slightly a reduction in the average age of members because of that change in shift as well. What it does mean is that often when we have new members being recruited through that digital channel, they're renewing at a slightly lower rate than the historical base that we have. And you may recall that when we talk about membership renewal rates, it's effectively an eighteen-month lag that we see that we report out on that renewal rate. And so as we look forward and see that trend continuing as we build more of that new digital member into the base and it slightly affects the mix, we expect it will have a slight impact on that overall membership renewal rate that we report. So we wanted to make sure we gave you visibility into that. When we look at individual cohorts of members, we feel good about the ability for us to be able to continue to drive improvement in renewal rate, but we are gonna see that impact through as it becomes a flow through from the continued growth in digital members. Ron Vachris : And then this is Ron. The question on Costco Next, Costco Next is our exclusive Costco member-only marketplace. It's fully curated by our buyers. So everything that's on that site has been reviewed by our buyers but is exclusive to Costco members. So we think it's just gonna enhance the relationship we have with our members and give more options for their shopping needs. Jiang Ma : Got it. Just to clarify, I was wondering if you were gonna have more 3P marketplace vendors using the retail media service and whether there's any implications on the member's side. Ron Vachris : That and that again is, as Gary mentioned earlier, we're in the early stages and we're gonna look at where we feel the benefits will be to our members. So that is to be determined yet. Jiang Ma : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Melius Research. Your line is open. Karen Short : Hey. Thanks very much. I know this is maybe a little out of left field, but just curious. There's kind of been a trend in retail for some for stock splits generally. And I'm wondering what your philosophy is on that because I know you want your employees to have an opportunity to buy stock, you know, below the store manager level. And the second question that's kind of unrelated is just tariffs. Any thoughts on that? And thoughts on what that could do to inflation? Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Karen. Yeah. On the stock split, you're probably aware that Costco has done stock splits in the past. It's something that we'll continue to evaluate and discuss with our board, but there isn't a plan at this time for a stock split. I think for us, the way we think about it is the economic arguments were showing the rep past are a little bit less clear because retail investors and employees both have the ability now to buy fractional shares, but we do also recognize that there's a benefit of the stock feeling more affordable for our retail investment employees. Were very important constituents for us. So we'll continue to evaluate over time. Gary Millerchip : And then I think the second part of the question was on tariffs. I think from a tariff point of view, what I would say is that, first of all, there's a lot of uncertain timing and scope of changes. So it makes it difficult for anyone to predict what the impact will be with confidence. And in general, of course, tariffs raise costs. That's not something that we see as a positive in general. With that being said, I'll quote my predecessor, Richard. He'd say, when it rains, it rains on everybody. And I think for us, we face tariffs in the past, and we believe that our merchants and buyers are equipped as anybody is to sort of work through and navigate and manage that situation. We have a plan over time where we have done that in the past, and typically, we'll look where we can to pull forward inventory buying. Actually, we've done already because of some of the less predictability around shipping and how much time product spends on the water and also because of the risk of strikes that we've seen in the past as well. Of course, try and work with our vendors to make sure we're looking for ways where we can to mitigate the cost. And we also consider alternative sourcing locations where that's practical as well. I guess the final sort of string in our bow would be is if we didn't see the value in an individual SKU, then we could always pivot to a different SKU item for the member. If we felt the value just wasn't there and it was more effective for us to move to a different item in the warehouse. I guess in context for us that the amount of business that's affected. We're about a quarter of our business is nonfoods, and then a subset of that is imported. So remember, it's a minority of our overall business, and then it's a smaller part of that as well we actually import the context. Karen Short : Great. Thank you very much. Have a great holiday. Gary Millerchip : You too. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Edward Kelly : Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask you about CapEx. You know, CapEx has kind of been inching up over the last couple of years. But taking a step back and thinking about the evolution of your business, your goals, growing them out. How are you thinking about, you know, the outlook for CapEx? Any meaningful changes ahead? And as part of this, you know, anything different sort of in the pipeline from a project or priority standpoint? Gary Millerchip : Yeah. Thanks, Ed. I wouldn't say there's really any major change. As you mentioned, we have been gradually increasing capital expenditure, more reflection of the continued growth of the business as we've opened new warehouses seen some inflation in those costs over the last few years. And we have, of course, been investing a little bit more in technology as well as we sort of modernize the platforms there and look to build the right capabilities to support growth in the future. But I think philosophically, to focus on the warehouses and invest in continuing to maintain the quality of athletes and invest in new growth warehouses in that twenty-five to thirty range, updating our supply chain and depots to support the capabilities there and both digitally. And then also, as I mentioned, sort of technology investments. But I wouldn't indicate at this point that there's any major change in trajectory. It's more just continuation of the growth strategy that we've had and executing on that strategy. Edward Kelly : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Your line is open. John Heinbockel : Hey. Hey, guys. Two quick things. Philosophically, you know, price investments get a lot of publicity. But when you think about reinvesting the MFI increase, price, product quality, right, IT, labor. There are a lot of things to invest in. You know, where do those other things rank relative to price? And then what does the international Club pipeline look like? I'm thinking in particular, where you control sites you know, even though they may be years away, is that you know, I don't think it's over a hundred, but how big is that pipeline today? Gary Millerchip : Yeah. Thanks, John. I'll in the first and Ron may add some color as well. I think overall, we look at the reinvestment of the membership fee holistically. So it's partly where is it that we can lower prices, of course. Part of it's where can we mitigate the impact of inflation to maintain the value for the member even if costs are increasing. It's how can we improve the membership experience including investing in our employees' wages as we've done recently as well. And, of course, innovation with new products through Kirkland Signature. So I think we tend to look at it holistically and say, how do we make sure that when we think about what our members are paying for the membership fee each year that we're delivering more value and showing them that they're getting greater value than they're paying by a meaningful margin for the value of being a member. Ron, anything you want to add on that? Ron Vachris : No. I think that that's accurate. And then expansion around the world, I think you'll continue to see an equal amount of thirty warehouses opening up over the next few years for sure. A good portion of those being out of the US, we see some great opportunities in Canada and Mexico have been strong countries for us. We continue to see growth opportunities both in Europe and Asia as well. So some of these projects take a lot longer than other ones will, so they'll come on at different times. But I think the outline of thirty a year seems very realistic. And a good portion of those not quite half to be outside of the US. Thank you. John Heinbockel : You're welcome. Thanks, John. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Rupesh Parikh : Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted it to Gary, to go back to your comment to core margins ex gas were up seventeen basis points, and you called out mixed in credit card co-brand program. There any more color you can provide in terms of what's driving that? Gary Millerchip : Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Rupesh. Overall, as you mentioned it, you know, we were pleased with where reported gross margin rate came in. We tend to look at it ex gas deflation, as you know, and that was up seven basis points. And then core on core was up three. So I think the overall message is that things were stable. When we look at the gross margin rate. There are a number of puts and takes in that that largely offset each other within the overall results. The main headwind as we signaled potentially could be the case, was around gas, which was impacted by the fact that we had a major event, obviously, twelve months ago or so in the Middle East that created volatility, and often that can create some strange margin performance, and we were cycling that. So that was the large headwind. I wouldn't say overall that we've seen in the long term gas margins be unpredictable. It just tends to be more unpredictable on individual quarters when you have that volatility. So that was the sort of biggest headwind. And then offsetting that in the quarter, we had some benefit again this quarter from e-commerce as margins improved there and the rate of improvement in e-commerce would have been largely similar to what we saw last quarter. So we were pleased with the progress we continue to see there. And then as you mentioned in the call, had a couple of offsets that we saw in some benefit from mix. As we look at the business. And then secondly, we saw benefit from the co-brand credit card program, as you mentioned. But, essentially, the way the credit card co-brand works is that we fund a portion of the rewards that are paid to members, and then we receive various incentives and payments from our issuing bank and all that flows into gross margin. And, essentially, the net effect of that was favorable for the quarter, which offset along with mix and the e-commerce benefits, the gas headwind. So as I mentioned, overall, I think there were no major takeaways from the puts and takes, but we're pleased that gross margin was up slightly even though we continued to invest in lower prices and deliver more value for the member. Rupesh Parikh : Great. Thank you for all the color. Happy holidays. Gary Millerchip : You too. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is open. Peter Benedict : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanna maybe, Ron, for you on the runway for growth in the US. You said thirty new clubs per year next handful of years here. Most of those are gonna be in the US. You guys are just over six hundred right now. I think it did include the other two players, we're talking about fourteen hundred plus clubs in the US. They're growing as well. How do you think about maybe the capacity for the club industry in the US and maybe for Costco in particular? What are you seeing that gives you confidence in your ability to keep growing at this pace in the US? Ron Vachris : I think the one thing I see is continued success of operations like I spoke of Pleasanton, California, that we opened the day before Thanksgiving. Right in between three high-volume Bay Area locations in the East Bay, and we opened this warehouse up not long ago and even finding incremental business significant incremental business from our members. As we relieve the pressure off of those high-volume warehouses, we see the existing member base coming more frequently and the build-back is quite nice for us. So we see incrementality of the new warehouse, and then we see very, very quick build-back on those as well. So not only do we still see some opportunities, you know, Scarborough, Maine, we building has had a tremendous first year in a smaller market like that that we see. So we see some runway for a few years ahead of us yet. We have a combination of new markets but we really are focusing on how do we continue to improve that member experience by relieving pressure off of some of these super high-volume warehouses and we're finding it to be incremental to the business. Peter Benedict : Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Greg Melich : Thanks. I wanted to circle back on e-commerce, the growth there thirteen percent. Could you update us on what the penetration is now and also how if you add on Instacart and, I guess, the Uber Eats start, where we're getting up to on that. Gary Millerchip : Yeah. Thanks, Greg, for the question. Yeah. We were pleased with the growth that we saw in digital. I think important to remember as well as we shared in the November sales release that there was some impact of timing of calendar as well. So the thirteen if you think about I think we shared the team shared that we're, like, a fifteen percent headwind in our November sales results. And so clearly, if you take about a third of that, you wouldn't be a million miles out with the impact that it but it would have had on our sales in the quarter as well. So we were pleased overall with the underlying trend and the metrics that we saw around downloads and traffic and average order were all up as well, which was encouraging. If you think about the mix of the business. Would be in the sort of from the numbers that we disclosed publicly as being part of our digital business in the sort of seven percent to eight percent range of our total sales. So as you know, it continues to outpace our overall growth, and we expect that trend to continue. You're exactly right that when you recognize how we define it compared to how others define it. We wouldn't include some of those third-party sites that are delivering, and there's a few other business parts of our business that we don't include in there as well that would fit in under other businesses. When we add those in there, and when you sort of strip out gas, which I think most companies do when they compare, we'd be north of ten percent in terms of total penetration of e-commerce sales. Greg Melich : Got it. Thanks. And then maybe circling back on private label, could you just update us now on the penetration, especially given some of those great new items you've come out with that you highlighted earlier in the call. And what that could eventually be. Ron Vachris : Yeah. I think it's up about thirty-three percent at this point in the US. Is where we've now hit. And that's primarily the food and sundry side of things where we see the majority of our private label. We're just bumping up against thirty-three percent and it's growing a little faster than the rest of the business. Greg Melich : That's great, guys. Have a great holiday. Ron Vachris : You as well. You too. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Your line is open. Scott Mushkin : Hey. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to maybe ask a higher-level question around your business, the traffic growth which is the lifeblood of a retailer, has been very strong given the size of the company. You talked about the Pleasanton opening. But I was wondering if you could kind of give us an idea of what you think is driving this. Is it the club format? Generally, resonating consumer life, okay. I should have been how do we think it's, like, two or three years? And the numbers just time. Ron Vachris : You're right. We've lost you halfway through the questions. I'm sorry? Scott Mushkin : I apologize, but I don't know why that's happening. You guys are clear as well. Actually, just to set this type of traffic growth is your initiatives, the industry, Kent said, and what your thoughts are about keeping this type of going three years. Ron Vachris : Okay. And I think we got most of your question. That really regards around traffic growth and why we what we see that happening and if we feel that can continue on. And that's what I'll try to answer, and hopefully that was what you're talking about. I think from some of the comments you made, I think it's all of the above. You know, and some of the fun facts I gave out there was just really to point to the growth success we're seeing in several parts of our company. Be it the pharmacy, the food court, our fresh foods area, I've gotta contribute a big part of that to our buyers and operators and the work that they're doing in keeping relevance to the member needs and being reflective of what, you know, are we we're focusing on some of the lower-cost proteins for some of our members while we're focusing on the Wagyu for the members that would like those goods as well. So I think our people are doing a tremendous job knowing our customer, but it really is all parts of the business are contributing. Their tire business is very strong. Our nonfood business continues to strengthen. E-commerce is doing their part. But it just goes back to execution from the teams. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Your line is open. Robbie Ohmes : Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. It's on the competitive impact, so it may end up sounding like more than one question. But are there any competitive impacts you guys are seeing, you know, worth calling out, you know, benefits or headwinds? So maybe remind us when, you know, a regional player you compete with raises their member, does that help you guys at all, retain or retention rates, things like that? And also, I know you've been asked this, but any pressures you're seeing on the fact that you guys don't do scan and go and Sam's seems to be doing really well with it and any other competitive impacts you can call out? Thanks. Gary Millerchip : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Robbie. I think, you know, I think we're generally our own biggest competitor, honestly. That's generally how we approach the business. Maybe the couple of trends that add some color on that that I would call out would be we haven't talked for some time about cannibalizing our own business with opening new warehouses and as Ron mentioned, generally, we're seeing significant incrementality. But as we have opened more warehouses, we certainly create of that. We don't split it out in our numbers. We just flow it through our results, but it does impact the number because we are moving some traffic from existing warehouses when we open a new one. I think from a competitive point of view, I guess the biggest tailwind I would call out, and Ron mentioned it briefly in prepared comments, around our business is that, obviously, we're seeing quite a lot of disruption work our teams are doing to deliver great value for the member, and continuing to improve the experience and make it easier to engage with our pharmacists. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we're seeing significant growth in that business today. I think that's partly the work that we're doing, and partly, I think there is some disruption in the industry currently as well. Robbie Ohmes : And just any comments on Scan and Go or maybe remind us why that might not be on your agenda? Ron Vachris : I mean, I think we've got you know, our job is, as Gary said, take care of the members and make sure they move through. Do we hear about Scan and Go? Yes. We do. Self-checkout has been a great option for our members, and we focus on that. Our job really is that we will continue to keep an eye on technology and how we can improve that front-end experience. That is the one pinch point. That was the focus of our door scanners as we took a lot of pressure off of the cashiers and moving lines through and saw some nice productivity enhancements when we did that. But at this point, it's not something we're hearing quite often. We do hear it randomly, but gonna keep an eye out there on technology and make sure that we're doing our part to keep the experience as strong as we can for our members. Robbie Ohmes : Great. Thank you. Ron Vachris : You're very welcome. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. Given the recent sales contribution from categories like precious metals and gift cards. Have you, a, expanded the aperture of what Costco is now willing to sell or what the member is willing to buy from Costco? And b, have you changed your philosophy on the margin where you are expecting more profitability from traditional product vendors to offset the negative margin impact from selling these items that don't drive a lot of profit? Thank you very much. Ron Vachris : I think as far as new categories, you go back to caskets that we've started many years ago that we would never thought would have been a business for us, and we were able to find a way to deliver great member value and great quality. And that was such as the addition to gasoline we had many years ago in the company as well. Is that can we find something that does meet the needs of our members ensure we can deliver the right quality and the great price? So I think the tickets and precious metals was, again, great work by our buying teams. And finding new areas that we can deliver great quality. And great value to our members. And I see them working hard on the next categories that are gonna be coming for us. But that's part of the treasure hunt at Costco is that we're always keeping nimble and continue to change those categories that we can find new areas to improve the lives of our members. Gary Millerchip : Maybe, Ron, just to add on that, Michael, to your question of, you know, I think we'd give a bit more credit in addition to Ron's point about it's great work by our merchants creating new and exciting items. We give a bit more credit, I think, to the impact they have on the business. Not necessarily because we see significant margin as you mentioned from them, but they're driving significant traffic to our website, and we do get a high proportion of cross-selling. When members are buying things like precious metals. So it's driving the ability to grow our digital business overall. I think we see it as something that also just creates a lot of awareness about e-commerce business as well. So as you know, we don't advertise, but it's identifying these exciting items that help drive traffic and awareness of what Costco offers. So and I think some of that is a factor in what helps with the continued growth in e-commerce just from a top-line perspective, but also the margin improvement that we talked about on the call. So I think, you know, we would look at it a little bit more broadly for sure. Michael Lasser : But just to clarify that second point, are you having to offset the margin impact from selling these traffic-driving items that don't carry a lot of margin, by requiring even better margins on the rest of the assortment? Gary Millerchip : No. What we're seeing is we're driving a mix improvement overall because of the traffic that it's driving and the engagement with the website. And remember, of course, as well that there's very low SG&A costs associated with that product. So it also helps create leverage in the e-commerce model as well. Ron Vachris : So yeah. So the answer is really no. We're not making more margin on those other items to offset that. We're just driving down our SG&A so we don't require more margin. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much, and have a good holiday. Ron Vachris : You as well. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open. Chuck Grom : Hey. Thanks very much. Ron, can you talk about Costco's right to earn more wallet share with your more affluent higher-income shopper, particularly on the discretionary side of the business? And then, Gary, just on the margin bridge, can you just explain why the 2% rebate was favorable five basis points? Historically, it's almost always negative or, you know, neutral. Thank you. Ron Vachris : Sure thing. Chuck, your question was why are we gaining more market share with our affluent customer? Is that what your question was? Chuck Grom : Now do I my question is do you think you you've earned the right to earn more wallet share with that higher-income shopper? Ron Vachris : Absolutely. I think we do. I think as we continue to find the brands, I mean, and deliver also with great quality Kirkland Signature, we'll continue to see that growth and that customer. We resonate that that is our member. That's who we cater our mixes to. And I think that we see great runway for us in the future. Gary Millerchip : And then, Chuck, on the second part of your question, so with the 2% rewards, think of it as that throughout the year, we're accruing what we believe is the right amount of redemption for the 2% reward. And generally speaking, we're gonna be conservative around that because we wanna make sure we're fully accrued. And then when we get into the first quarter each year, we're sort of truing up if you like what the actual spend was. So I'd almost think of the adjustment this quarter sort of offsetting the increases that we saw in the back half of last year. And so you have to net those out to say underlying, there is a gradual increase in the 2% spend it kinda nets off between quarter by quarter. Chuck Grom : Okay. So it was essentially a true-up then. Gary Millerchip : Right. Chuck Grom : Okay. Great. Awesome. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Kelly Bania : Thanks for taking our questions, Ron and Gary. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about your partnerships with Instacart and Uber now that you've had Uber for quite some time. What you've learned? What is the pace of growth, and how that's adding to comps, and just general awareness among your membership base of the service there, particularly as you add new services, like you mentioned, the pharmacy, I guess, coming in and what something like that could do to the growth there. Ron Vachris : I guess I will start with that. Very strong partnerships with both organizations. We have closely looked at what the behaviors of the members were and found great mentality to our member shop frequency goes way up. And, you know, it changes the shopping habits. I think they'll use us more for fill-in between their big Costco brick and mortar shop to go into an Instacart or an Uber. And shop those directions. So I think that we're finding that it's the most cost-effective way to do some small non-food item deliveries as well. Where we would have otherwise shipped those via UPS or a carrier from a distribution center. Can now have those to a member within a few hours. So if you're looking for a blender, that will fit in the back of a Prius, we can get that to you in a couple of hours at a very low cost. So it's improving our e-commerce delivery speed and time to the member and convenience is there as well. So very happy with the partnership. Our head merchant works very closely with both of those organizations and we think it's a great service for our members. Gary Millerchip : And I guess the only thing to add, Kelly, is the first part of your question, it continues to grow very strongly. So at least in line with the pace that we see in our digital business overall. Ron Vachris : Slightly higher than our e-commerce business growth. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chuck Sarankowski with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Chuck Sarankowski : Afternoon, everyone. Could you talk a little bit about labor relations and current negotiations with the Teamsters? Please. Ron Vachris : You know, I guess, Chuck, what I will say about that is that Costco, we will always take care of our employees as we always have done. That means that we're gonna focus on a fair and a timely process for getting to an agreement with the Teamsters. You know, we have a forty-year track record of dealing fairly with the Teamsters union, and really nothing has changed about that. So these are Costco employees. They're of great importance to us. And we're gonna do everything we can to take care of those employees as we do all of our employees. Chuck Sarankowski : Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlow with Jefferies. Your line is open. Corey Tarlow : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the international performance that you saw decelerated on a multiyear stack versus Q4. So just curious by region if there's anything to call out that changed versus prior quarters. Thank you. Gary Millerchip : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Corey. I don't think there's anything we'd be particularly calling out. I mean, there's certainly some nuances sometimes between some of the international markets of when certain holidays fall and they would have had. I'll give you an example, which I wasn't familiar with before joining the company and having recent conversations. But in Taiwan, there's a big impact from the holiday season in the same way there is here around Black Friday. And so there are nuances like that that we see in individual markets that sometimes can affect the calendar. But overall, we've been pleased with the momentum that we've seen in the international businesses, and we continue to see strong growth relative to both our own internal expectations and then also as we look at the growth in those markets, how we continue to grow our share. So nothing I would call out as being unusual there. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Laura Champine with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Laura Champine : Thanks for taking my question. It the follow-up on your digital business, which obviously is growing well, but how would senior management diagnose or grade your online presence from a look, feel, and function perspective relative to your competition? And related to that, this growth in members who are joining online, is that something you're driving, or is that just an output of the attractiveness of your online offer? Gary Millerchip : Yeah. Thanks for the question. You know, I think again, I'll say we're probably our own toughest critic. I think when we look at our business overall, and we look at the growth over the last ten years, we've actually grown at a faster pace than the e-commerce sort of business in the US has grown in general. So in one respect, we're very pleased with the momentum and the growth that we've seen and continuing to see that higher engagement. But we're never satisfied. We believe there's more work we can do to keep improving the member experience. We made recent changes with things like search functionality and making inventory available through the mobile app, and those changes are certainly members are seeing the benefit of that and commenting positively on the changes that we're seeing. But we know that we're on a technology journey. We've sort of been building the foundations of that journey over the last few years, and the goal is to keep getting better and to keep enhancing the member experience. So I'd say we still believe there's more work to do, and we believe by doing that work, we can continue growing our digital business even more effectively. Ron Vachris : And I would add to that. We realize that we do have some opportunity. We definitely see that we can continue to improve. Gary is exactly right. We're doing the back of the end, back of the house work at this point. Speed, stability, making sure that all the foundational work is done so we can build on that. And then I think in short order, people will start seeing the front side of things that will come in. But I think Costco Logistics is a great example of the progress we've made. We are now able to pre-deploy things around the US and have deliveries made in four days which a couple of years ago would have taken us two weeks. We're seeing the distribution centers coming online. Starting to see the app usage go way up. Functionality is being added to that as well. So it's a journey. We're gonna start seeing some more forward-facing improvements in the next twelve months as we sort of start putting our logistics sides behind us, and we get those things taken care of as far as the e-commerce engagement with membership sign-ups, probably the biggest difference is that we have less executive members sign up online which do renew at a higher basis. And so and I think that big part the big part of that is that they don't have an employee to talk to when they're making that transaction. And don't understand all the benefits of the executive membership. So we're able to capture those later on. And but that's the first thing we see there is that at least we start engaging with them as a member, and then we will work on showing them the benefits of the executive membership down the road. Laura Champine : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
