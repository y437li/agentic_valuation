All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker\u2019s prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we\u2019d like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session (Operator Instructions). I\u2019d now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Thank you, Marvin. Good afternoon, everybody. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our conference call to review our operating performance for the first quarter of this year. Our performance gives us confidence that we are on track to deliver our full year guidance. In addition, consistent with our expectations that 2014 will be a data rich year, we\u2019ve already reported significant data on evolocumab and T-VEC and expect Phase III data on four other programs in the remainder of the year. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway will lead the call today. Bob will provide a brief review of our operational progress followed by our interim CFO Michael Kelly who will review our Q1 results. Following Michael, our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper will discuss our product performance during the quarter and trends that we see going forward. Sean Harper, our Head of R&D will then provide a brief update on the many late-stage opportunities that we have in our pipeline. After Sean\u2019s comments, we should have plenty of time for Q&A. We will use slides for presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by email. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay, thank you Arvind. The first quarter of the year completes and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re on track to deliver our financial and operational targets for the year. Revenues were up 7% for the quarter, reflecting strong performance in Europe and the benefit of our international expansion including having acquired back from Roche our rights to Neulasta and NEUPOGEN in number of emerging markets. In the U.S. while underlying demand for our products remained strong, sales were affected by inventory draw downs across the portfolio, as Tony will describe shortly. We maintained discipline around our capital and operating expenses in the quarter, as reflected in our 18% growth in operating income and strong cash flows on the quarter. Turning to our operational progress, we said in January that we expected 2014 to be a data rich year for us and that\u2019s certainly what it has been so far. We are excited about evolocumab and the data we generated in our pivotal programs and we are moving rapidly now to file our regulatory submissions in the U.S. and Europe this year. We have both once monthly and twice monthly dosing options; we believe evolocumab would be an important advance for patients with high levels of LDL cholesterol. Onyx is performing well and we are encouraged by the prospect of Kyprolis moving into earlier lines of therapy in multiple myeloma, as further data become available later this year. We would be presenting data on T-VEC and blinatumomab at the upcoming ASCO meeting and expect to report on four other Phase 3 programs during the course of the year. In addition to our innovative portfolio, our biosimilar portfolio continues to progress favorably with three of our six programs in pivotal trials currently. Heading into the balance of the year, we feel we\u2019re in strong position to continue investing in the long-term growth of our business, while returning capital to shareholders in the form of increased dividend payments. Before turning to Michal Kelly to walk us through financials, let me thank my Amgen colleagues for their focus on delivering for our shareholders and the patients we serve. Michael? Michael Kelly : Thanks Bob. Let me start by highlighting a few important points on our financial results. The underlying operating performance of the company is tracking well against our plans for 2014 and accordingly our revenue and EPS guidance remain intact. Our full ownership of Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada drove 18% operating income growth as we were able to keep operating expenses flat even after absorbing the operations of Onyx. Turning to page four of the presentation, you will see revenues grew by 7% with 5% product sales growth and $78 million of growth in other revenues primarily due to our Nexavar and Stivarga partnerships. Revenues declined on a quarter-over-quarter basis, which was consistent with our historical pattern for the first quarter. However, the decline was a bit exacerbated this year by the wholesaler and end user inventory dynamic at the ended 2013. As I mentioned, operating income grew 18% as operating expenses were flat year-over-year. Within operating expenses cost of sales margin improved by 0.5 points to 15.7% driven by lower royalties, research and development expenses increased by 17% year-over-year with roughly half of that growth driven by the addition of Kyprolis and the balance due to other late stage clinical programs, SG&A expenses decreased by 14% driven by a significant reduction of [inward] related expenses. Other income and expenses were $160 million in the quarter, unfavorable to the first quarter of 2013 due to realized gains on our cash investment portfolio a year ago. Despite 13% growth in pre-tax income net income declined 4% and earnings per share declined 5% due to favorable tax items in the year ago period. Specifically you will recall that last year we recognized the full amount of the 2012 federal R&D credit and resolved federal RS which enabled us to release provisions we held against potential tax liabilities. The tax rate in the first quarter of this year was 15.4% inline with our full year tax rate guidance. Finally, our share count increased 1% as we did not repurchase any shares over the last 12 months. Now turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 5. We generated $1 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter of 2014, a year-over-year increase of 9% ahead of revenue growth. We also increased our quarterly dividend per share by 30% with payments totaling a $0.5 billion in the quarter. At the end of the quarter we held $23.2 billion in cash, short-term and restricted investments, up approximately $2 billion versus a year ago. And our debt balance was $32 billion, reflecting the financing of the Onyx acquisition and our commitment to maintain a solid investment grade credit rating. Lastly, turning to page 6, we are reconfirming our revenue guidance of $19.2 to $19.6 billion for the year and our earnings guidance of $7.90 to $8.20 earnings per share. Our guidance on tax and capital expenditures remains unchanged as well. On the tax rate, let me remind you that our guidance assumes that the R&D tax credit will be extended in 2014 and retroactively apply to the full year. Let me now turn to Tony. Thank you. Tony Hooper : Thanks Michael and good afternoon folks. You\u2019ll find a summary of our global sales performance for the first quarter on slide number 7. Product sales grew 5% year-over-year. Our international business grew 9%, driven by strong performance in the Europe and the acquisitions are progressing right in several new and emerging markets. In the U.S., our business grew 4% year-over-year. As Michael said, quarter-over-quarter global sales were down 9%, a trend which is consistent with the first quarter last year. This was driven predominantly by U.S. inventory draw-downs in the first quarter following wholesaler and end-customer inventory builds in the fourth quarter of last year. This affected maybe all products, but most notably Enbrel. Total U.S. wholesaler days on hand declined from 15 days at the end of the 2013 to 13 days at the end of this quarter. Our underlying business however, as evidenced by the IMS in-market prescription demand data across our products remained strong and inline with our expectations. As Bob mentioned, we are confident that we\u2019ll achieve our full year revenue guidance. Let\u2019s review our first quarter product performance beginning with Enbrel. As I said, sales were impacted by wholesaler and end customer end results at the end of 2013. The end market IMS data shows underlying demand in rheumatology continues to be strong, while we have seen a slight decline in the dermatology segment. Both of these segments however are growing at double-digits. These demand trends for Enbrel have continued into second quarter. With extrinsic exclusivity of Enbrel and its established track record of long-term efficacy and safety, we will continue to invest in growing this important brand. Turning now to Neulasta and Neupogen. As a reminder, Neulasta represents over 75% of combined sales of these two products. As I noted earlier, this quarter includes sales in several new and emerging markets where we acquired commercialization rights effective January 1. This is a further step in our strategy to expand globally. On a year-over-year basis, Neulasta increased 5%, while Neupogen declined 3%. We\u2019ve seen nominal impact from recently launched short acting competition in the U.S. and long acting competition in Europe. Nevertheless, we have taken this competition seriously and responding accordingly to maintain our leadership position across both brands. Neupogen and Neulasta have a long history of safe, efficace and reliable high quality supply. Moving on to Aranesp. Aranesp sales were down 2% year-over-year. Looking forward we continued to expect pricing pressure and competition in Europe. EPOGEN increased 6%. We continue to monitor hemoglobin levels and dose utilizations within the new bundled payment system. Sensipar sales increased 2% year-over-year, driven by higher units demand from continued segment growth. Next, Nplate and Vectibix; sales in aggregate were higher by 18% year-over-year driven by strong unit demand. For Vectibix, we continued to gain share in both Europe and the U.S. In Europe which represents over 50% of Vectibix sales, we continue to highlight the recent addition of first-line metastatic colorectal cancer to our label. And we're excited about the opportunity to serve these patients. Now a few comments on our denosumab franchise. Let me start with Prolia. Sales grew 38% year-over-year driven by segment share gains in both the U.S. And Europe. We do see some seasonality that we have come to expect during the first quarter. The second quarter is off to a good start though. Our new direct-to-consumer campaign on television launched in January this year, led to a significant increase in unaided awareness from 10% to 23% as well as driving a fourfold increase in traffic to the prolia.com website. As announced earlier this month, we've also ended our collaboration with GSK in Europe and selected modules. We're in the process of transitioning all commercial activities. We believe this will definitely enable us to leverage our experience, of successfully launching Prolia in other parts of the world to drive greater growth in these markets. Further it will build experience and capacity in countries that will be important in accelerating future growth of our pipeline products. XGEVA sales increased 25% year-over-year driven by strong unit demand growth in both the U.S. and European markets. In the U.S. we continue to see share gains despite generic [lunatic] competition. Outside the U.S. sales grew 76% driven by the momentum of several successful launches in Europe during 2013. Our focus remains on highlighting the superior clinical profile in XGEVA. Let me now turn to our newest product, Kyprolis. Underlying demand trends remain consistent. Kyprolis continues to be the therapy of choice in third line multiple myeloma in the U.S. We expect the next major revenue inflection point for Kyprolis would be when second line data is included in the label. Lastly the other products category which includes our businesses in Turkey and Brazil decreased 36% year-over-year. This is a $250 million business with annual growth inclusive of negative foreign exchange impact in mid single digits, they are contract or tender driven businesses and therefore fluctuate quarter-by-quarter. In conclusion we feel very confident in the strength of our underlying business. With the first quarter inventory draw down behind us, we expect the second quarter to be in line with underlying demand. We remained confident that we will deliver on our full year revenue guidance. Let me now pass you to Sean. Sean Harper : Thanks, Tony, good afternoon. 2014 is a data rich year for us and more optimally exciting start. The reception by cardiologists and [lymphoid] experts to our pivotal Phase III evolocumab studies at The American College of Cardiology was remarkable. The data themselves coupled with the flexibility of every two week and monthly delivery options were overwhelmingly [views] positive. In addition positive results from our Phase II evolocumab study in Japanese patients were recently presented at Japan Circulation Society. We are working diligently on our 2014 evolocumab global filing packages including the U.S. submission. Further within our cardiovascular portfolio, FDA recently granted fast track status to ivabradine in chronic heart failure and we are on track to make this submission in 2Q. Together, these two innovative molecules evolocumab and dyslipidemia now fabricating chronic heart failure represent very meaningful potential value to patients at cardiovascular risk. Turning to our oncology programs, we continue to look forward to new Kyprolis data including a review by an independent data monitoring committee of an interim analysis of the ASPIRE study in relapsed multiple myloma patients and the final analysis of the FOCUS study in relapsed refractory multiple myloma. In both of these event driven studies, making precise estimates of the timing of the analysis is quite challenging. Our best estimates are that one or both of these analysis could occur in 2Q although either of these analysis could instead occur in 3Q. Our immunooncology programs continue to advance. In 2013 we reported that our Phase III TVEC study in metastatic melanoma met its durable response rate primary endpoint. We recently announced that with the p value of 0.51 we narrowly miss the statistical significance on the secondary endpoint of overall survival, a pretty strong result given that the study was not statistically [paddling] for survival. These data will be presented at ASCO and we are currently reviewing the results with clinicians, regulators and payers to determine the best course forward. In addition, we continue to believe that there is an opportunity for T-VEC to primary immune system with checkpoint inhibitors. We\u2019re currently investigating T-VEC in combination with ipilimumab or Yervoy in a Phase 1b2 metastatic melanoma study the 1b portion will be presented at ASCO this year. Moving forward with our collaborative efforts with Merck on PD-1 antagonism and exploring other such collaborations. We also recently reviewed the Blinatumomab confirmatory Phase 2 results in relapsed/refractory adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These data which will also be presented at ASCO continue to support a positive benefit risk profile in these patients who have exhausted other therapeutic options. We\u2019re therefore initiating discussions with regulators on the potential for filing based on these data. Our psoriasis program for Brodalumab, which we\u2019re developing with our partners with AstraZeneca/Medimmune, consists of three Phase 3 studies, one placebo controlled and two head-to-head studies comparing to ustekinumab or STELARA. We expect to see the data from the placebo controlled study in the second quarter with the other two studies moving out during the course of the year. We look forward to seeing into the programs and we hope it would be not only remarkable efficacy but also paramount important to psoriasis a strong safety profile. I am also pleased to announce that we\u2019ve initiated our Phase 3 program psoriatic arthritis. As you may recall we\u2019ve developed the only monoclonal antibody antagonist of the CGRFP receptor in the clinic AMG 334 which has demonstrated a potent ability to block this access in humans. We therefore move directly into Phase 2b dose ranging studies in the setting of migraine prophylaxis with what we feel is the most optimal mortality of receptor antagonism using the monoclonal antibody. We expect to see the results of our episodic migraine Phase IIb study by the end of this year and the results of our recently initiated chronic migraine Phase IIb dose ranging for [psoriatic] next year. Finally I would like to take a moment to thank my colleagues in R&D and many other parts of the company for helping to make possible the data flow we're experiencing this year to help patients in these. Bob. Bob Bradway :  Okay. Thank you, Sean. Marvin why don\u2019t we open up the call to questions and would you please remind our listeners to the process for the Q&A. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Matt Roden - UBS: Thanks very much for taking the question. At ACC it sounded like you guys were not quite sure if you would be able to file evolocumab in the U.S. this year, but now you are talking about global filings in 2014. So the question is what\u2019s changed that based on the FDA interactions and how confident are you that you can get that done this year. The way that once you have, now that you have the data how do you think this product is going to be used to ahead outcomes data, where are docs selling it? Thanks. Bob Bradway :  Thanks Matt. Those are good questions. Sean why don\u2019t you respond? Sean Harper :  Yes, I will take the first part. Yes, I think this is clearly an evolving situation which we assess on an ongoing basis, our interactions with regulators as well as where the program stands or with respect to the accumulation of the weight of evidence required for a file. And all around I think at this point, we have a good degree of confidence in our ability to file this year including the United States. So that\u2019s why we're making that statement. Tony would you want to -- from a medical perspective it\u2019s clear to me that there are individuals who have a high cardiovascular risk residual despite the use of existing therapies, particularly [statin], either despite full dose intensive statin therapy they still have a modifiable risk factor in elevated LDL or they are unable to be subjected to a intensive or even moderate intensity statin regim. And it is clear to me that those patients are viewed by the physicians that I talk to as patients who would be appropriate for a therapy like evolocumab, even prior to the availability of outcomes data. So, from just a pure medical doctor to doctor interaction, that's the sense I get, there is a real patient population out there indeed. Tony Hooper : So, the only thing I would add to for sure just is that we have physicians talking about patients in three buckets. Obviously the [FX] patients are the unique subpopulation. And then secondly, the high risk patients, and the high risk patients those are either contact statin or can no longer tolerate to statin or those were on statin but not yet at the global level. So those continue to be the areas, physicians see this drugs will bring the greater (inaudible) truly against all around high risk cardiovascular patients. Bob Bradway : Okay. Let's go to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Terrence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terrence Flynn - Goldman Sachs : Hi, thanks. Just two quick ones from me. First on Enbrel, Tony, I was wondering if you can quantify the inventory impact in the quarter for us. And then on the PCSK9 outcomes trial, Sean I was just wondering if you can give us any sense of enrollment at this point. And then any inside on powering of the interim and final analysis? Thank you. Tony Hooper : So, let me take Enbrel first then. As you look at our base it\u2019s clear that our fourth quarter is always slightly larger than the first quarter. And during the fourth quarter of last year we did have some strange snow storms in the East Coast, which resulted in about $120 million of product that moved from one year to another. When I look at the Enbrel data itself and what I was looking at this morning that was the NRXs from IMS. And to me the NRXs which account for about 35% of total RXs are the true indicator of where that brand is going in the future. On the rheumatology side, NRXs grew quarter-on-quarter 14% and on the dermatology side the NRXs grew 11% quarter-on-quarter. So just to give you an idea of what -- the brand fully large growing segment areas with Enbrel itself getting new prescriptions as well. Sean? Sean Harper : Yes. We are quite pleased with the outcome study enrollment. This study is very adequately powered to detect an affect side that would be clinically relevant to patients and to physicians\u2019 arm and this of course is a product that we think has great potential. So, we spread (inaudible) on the design of the trial. There is no interim analysis, formal interim analysis outcome study thus far. Arvind Sood : Okay. Let\u2019s move on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison - Morgan Stanley : Great, thanks for taking the question. I want to ask on the cost side and you guys had talked a little bit about this on the call. But it looks like quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year you were up, you were down about $160 million and you had suggested Enbrel was about 800 for the year in terms of savings, there is $40 million delta. I am just wondering if that was all Onyx-related expenses and if we should expect to see that amount of the Enbrel savings drop to the bottom-line for the rest of the year? Thanks. Bob Bradway :  Thank you, Matthew. I think yes you should assume that you will see sort of this run rate and Enbrel dropped to the bottom-line offset by the Onyx expenses. Matthew Harrison - Morgan Stanley : Thank you. Arvind Sood :  Okay. Let\u2019s go through to the next question. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company :  Thanks for taking my question. Maybe for Tony on the GCSF business, I thought you pulled in about $200 million from the Roche acquisition in terms of ex-U.S. sales, didn\u2019t look like we recognized nearly as much in Q1. Is that $200 million on annual basis $50 million on a quarterly basis? Is this a tender business also that\u2019s quite lumpy going forward? Tony Hooper :  The acquisition looks like it was about $200 million acquisition obviously broken into the quarters. The quarters tend to trend sort of about 25% each, I think the first quarter was slightly lighter than that normal 25% and above 23%. Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company :  Okay. So that\u2019s offset by some share losses then? Tony Hooper :  Well, as I said, we have (inaudible) in the marketplace competing against NEUPOGEN in the U.S. and we have long acting competition in Europe. We haven\u2019t seen huge impact from them, but of course there was a small impact, yes. Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company :  Okay. Thank you. Arvind Sood :  Okay. Let\u2019s take the next question. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank :  Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So, just trying to get drilled down a little bit more on inventory versus what\u2019s going on with some of the products. So, are you seeing any impact from generic in NEUPOGEN and are you seeing any impact -- in the market on Enbrel? Bob Bradway : Okay. Ron will try and those two points. First Tony on NEUPOGEN, [Garrett] you want to address? Tony Hooper : So as I said, with NEUPOGEN we have GRANIX in the market from Teva they\u2019ve been in the market from late last year. We have seen a nominal impact from the product in the marketplace. As regards to Enbrel, we think only exit inventory is not being worked out system and as I said, (inaudible) the NRXs those are showing double-digit growth as they go from quarter-to-quarter. Arvind Sood : All right Marvin, can we take the next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Josh Schimmer - Piper Jaffray : Thanks for taking the questions, just a couple on the CGRP receptor antibody program for migraine. First, do you have any data from the decode dataset what phenotype is for patients with CGRP or CGRP receptor mutations? And then second who do you think is on the lead amongst the CGRP antibodies receptor -- how close to lead are you? Thanks. Bob Bradway : Yes. So there are not the sort of the validation for this particular drug target is less from human genetics and more from the works that\u2019s been done with small molecule receptor antagonist. And now reportedly by a couple of the [ligand] sequestering antibodies where we haven\u2019t seen detailed data, but there has been releases of positive results of that kind of have a reverse pharmacology level of human validation of the target. With respect to an antibody that locks the receptor, we\u2019re fairly well in the lead. We have the only antibody locking receptor it\u2019s very difficult very difficult to engineer. In the case of just any antibody, I would say that I think we're in a very strong position right now to potentially make it first to market then at the antibodies, but that\u2019s a little hard to say when you are still at the Phase 2. Tony Hooper :  We were excited about this program, Josh and excited about the early data, but as was the case we were locking out, we wanted to just keep our head down and keep executing against the program and it looks exciting to us, but with the competitive profile, here is not completely transparent. Arvind Sood : So, we\u2019ll take next question. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Sanford Bernstein. Geoffrey Porges - Sanford Bernstein : Thanks very much for taking question. A question for Bob, look there is a lot going in pharma and some larger biotech and [speck] pharmas in terms of asset swaps, relocation of assets. And I\u2019m just wondering in the outside Amgen has two businesses; legacy product and growth product and with all of the restructuring going on has Amgen considered any different structures or ownership of the assets that might enhance shareholder value? Thanks. Bob Bradway : Sure Geoff, as you would expect, we continually review things that we can do to drive shareholder value and that\u2019s absolutely what we are focused on. We continue to believe that the strategy that we're following is the one that will enable us to drive most value for our shareholders and that obviously includes executing against the innovative programs in our pipeline and we talked about a few high profile programs here on this call already and continuing to advance our similar programs and we have six programs that we think we're competitively positioned for that we begin to launch in 2017. And of course international expansion we think is opportunity for further growth process well. So, we're focus on executing our strategy, but we obviously pay close attention what\u2019s going on in our industry and we continue to look for opportunities that may offer us a chance to drive incremental value for our shareholders. Geoffrey Porges - Sanford Bernstein : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Yaron Werber - Citi: Thanks for taking my question. Actually, I believe a question on Kyprolis and just trying to understand a little bit, what are you guys expecting from FOCUS and ASPIRE, I mean based on our analysis, ASPIRE maybe unlikely to stop at the next loop, FOCUS has been taking quite a long time. So, I'm trying to get a sense, what should we read into your comments that you're not expecting much in terms of acceleration until label extension into second line, that's technically in ASPIRE program not a FOCUS program? And then just a follow up question on (inaudible) you are really buying to the same sub-unit my understanding as is obviously your thoughts about potential heart failure and also what you guys are seeing on the GI side tolerability wise for the new formulation? Thank you. Bob Bradway : All right. We may take these questions in two parts, I think there is a piece of the first question for Sean on the time tables in FOCUS and ASPIRE, I think Tony you can talk about really the earlier lines of patients. Sean Harper : I think it's always tempting when we see these events driven studies take longer than as expected through the original kind of estimates that are may to read into that. That there is something going on that the therapeutic is having a bigger effect than what's anticipated and what have you. And I sort of learned through experience that's not a wise thing to do generally that whatever is going on with the kinetics of collecting last events that are necessary to do these studies, which is at this point we're talking about single-digit number, that's coming in for month and it can be quite to catch that month in both the studies. This is fairly typical that these studies grew up to their final numbers. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to try to read anything scientifically into that around whether the agents are having the desired effect or not in the trials. Bob Bradway : And touch on oprozomib Sean and\u2026 Sean Harper : Yes, on the oprozomib, yes, I mean with oprozomib we are in still in early stages and with this product we now can have GI toxicity at some doses. And so we are developing the product with that in mind working on formulations, working on dosing schedule to try and make sure we can deliver the greatest therapeutic benefit without having any tolerable GI safety profile. So that\u2019s kind of the name of the game with developing an oral version of this class drug. Tony Hooper : And then my comment about the next infection that has no hidden meaningful at all, we\u2019d always assume that the ASPIRE data would give us the second line indication in the U.S. first which will be followed our launches outside the U.S. because we have to post registration, negotiate pricing. Bob Bradway : Okay, let\u2019s go to next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group : In the question, number one, has the commercial performance of Kyprolis since the acquisitions Onyx, has it met your expectations, exceeded your expectations, or coming below your expectation? And number tow, I am sorry to beat this horse guys, I still don\u2019t understand, it\u2019s a late night over in the East Coast, I still don\u2019t understand what exactly happened with Enbrel in the quarter. You said NRXs are up, but is it your assertion that total patient demand increased 1Q sequentially over the 4Q? Thank you very much. Bob Bradway : Okay. Thanks, Mark. We\u2019ll get to both those questions. Tony, let\u2019s just start with Kyprolis. Tony Hooper :  Okay. So starting Kyprolis, I think the Onyx team going through the transition and the acquisition has a done a superb job in maintaining focus and keeping the people\u2019s attention locked to the business. We continue as we speak now to be the number one drug of choice for third line which is exactly where the label is. Our market share in this particular indication, we estimate to be at least double that of our nearest competitor. So in terms of our ability to deliver value linked to label, we have continued to deliver what we expected. We continue to believe in drug that this particular class will be the backbone of the treatment to this disease and we look forward to expanding the label with the second line and perhaps the first line data. Let me go back to Enbrel. Enbrel, as you know what happened was clearly an additional buy in because we\u2019re shipping biologic, we want to make sure that the product will reach the customer within 48 hours, so that we will be very careful about when we ship product. The snow delayed some shipments, we held them back and there was an additional demand from wholesalers, about $120 million that took place in the last week of 2013, the majority of that was Enbrel. When I look at the end market data to-date in fact, I see growth in both rheumatology and in the dermatology business. To me, I look at the NRX that has been a predictor of how the business is growing in this particular area for Enbrel, NRX is at about 35% of total TRXs. And I do see a distinctive growth between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So although the first quarter exactly looks more than the fourth quarter, I see a 14% growth in rheumatology and an 11% growth quarter-on-quarter in dermatology. Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group : Thank you. Bob Bradway :  Sharing a lot of data with you there Mark but fundamentally we think the demand is intact for Enbrel and rest of base business. Okay let\u2019s go to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JP Morgan. Geoff Meacham - JP Morgan : Good afternoon guys and thanks for taking the question. So, one for Tony on Kyprolis. So, is there anything on the demand side either post the ASH meeting or the market share that you can talk about on a sequential basis? And then one for Sean also on Kyprolis, that does the slower event rate for focus ASPIRE, does that change your assumption and make you think differently about the head-to-head study that\u2019s ongoing with Velcade? Thanks. Tony Hooper : Geoff, thanks for the question. When we look at our business, we\u2019re looking to read in market demand; we do see positive growth between the fourth quarter 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, yes. It\u2019s low single-digit growth. Sean Harper : Yes. And with respect to reading again anything through from the time it takes to accrue the last of these events and these types of trials, it is very difficult for me to read anything through scientifically that would project anything about the design or strategy of having the head-to-head studies with Velcade. I think that those will remain kind of unrelated in my mind. Geoff Meacham - JP Morgan : Okay. Thank you. Sean Harper : Sure. Bob Bradway : Okay, Marvin? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Nomura. Ian Somaiya - Nomura: Thanks. Just another question on Kyprolis and maybe just to follow-up to Geoff. What would lead to you maybe reconsidering the size of the head-to-head studies versus Velcade, just what would you need to see in the ASPIRE study or the Focus study to maybe have rethink the sizing or maybe trying to get the data set before Velcade ultimately goes generic? Bob Bradway : That\u2019s a tough question to answer, Ian. You\u2019re asking us to respond to a sort of hypothetical. Sean, I don\u2019t whether you have anything you can add to help Ian? Sean Harper :  No, I don\u2019t, I think it\u2019s relatively unlikely that we\u2019ll see anything from these two studies that would change what we\u2019re doing in head to head studies. And they are moving along right now at considerable pace and changing the designs would be potentially challenging to do at this point anyway. But I don\u2019t, I would doubt that the results would warrant that. Bob Bradway : Can we just go to the next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets : Yes, thanks. A question on Focus and ASPIRE from an expectation standpoint what the street and maybe from your expectations, do you believe that focus is a higher risk study than ASPIRE, and Focus for some reason has not hit on survival, how confident are we that ASPIRE would still support a European approval given (inaudible) walk through some of that thinking? Sean Harper :  Yes, so I think probably with focus you\u2019re looking at Kyprolis mono therapy against a combination therapy as some older drugs that are not used as frequently these days but do represent kind of standard of care in many of the European countries. And that is one picture, the other picture is of course you are taking Kyprolis and you are adding it on top of Rev-Dex and comparing it to Rev-Dex alone. So I suppose I would say that the ASPIRE study is the one that is mostly likely to have a positive result, because we know what happens if we put Velcade on top of Rev-Dex, you get a pretty reasonable additional clinical benefit. So from the scientific perspective that would be how I\u2019d look at that. We do believe that the ASPIRE study will stand alone in leading to an indication for the population that it's stays. It won't cover the later line type patients who would be the subject of FOCUS. But we do believe that in Europe it will stand alone, PSF is very low accepted surrogate endpoint in this particular type of malignancy. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Ravi Mehrotra - Credit Suisse : Thanks for taking my question. You touched on this briefly, but just to get back to the Prolia ex-U.S. buy back from GSK, was that deal mainly driven by the wants and need to change the trajectory of the product, also lay down operational bedrock? And if the operational bedrock comes in, can you just remind us what other ROW infrastructure you've brought in or acquired recently. Sean Harper : Yes. I'm going to just take a crack at the high level on that Ravi and then Tony you can speak to the details on those questions. Obviously our business has changed a lot Ravi since the time we formed that venture Glaxo. We've been very successful in expanding internationally over the past several years, including with the transactions that we referred to on this call, bought back NEUPOGEN and Neulasta in the number of markets around the world from Roche. So, we have a presence down in regions of the world that we didn't previously and we remain very excited about the potential portfolio and so this was a good opportunity for us to take full control back of that product. And we had designed the deal in such a way that we could exit the partnership, if we felt that was in our interest to do that. And I think both we and Glaxo felt that we found a fair way to transition full ownership back to us. But Tony, why don\u2019t you talk a little bit about some of the specifics in the marketplace and why we\u2019re optimistic for the growth potential of both? Tony Hooper : So, there were a couple of things, I mean one the final level for (inaudible) was slightly different to what was in visits when we first did the negotiation. So it\u2019s a slightly more focused target audience we call on [demand]. Number two, we have been very successful on our own in developing strong markets here for the product and truly working in a partnership not as effective as [digging] ourselves. So we truly believe that the clear focus by ourselves results supporting on the defined targeted audience and have the ability to pick up and to grow this business more effectively. Secondly that will then result in us having a broader footprint in this particularly area. The progress acquisition gave us rights in quite a large number of countries around the world, but predominantly increased the size of our businesses in the Middle East, Russia Latin America, Mexico and South East Asia those were the big ones. Ravi Mehrotra - Credit Suisse : All right, that\u2019s very good. Thanks. Sean Harper : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of [Yin Wong] with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys, thank you for taking my questions as well. First of all, I guess Tony mentioned that inventory for this quarter went down from 15 days from last quarter to 13 days. Do you guys see that stabilizing at this level or you continue to see a declining level in inventories and wholesalers? And then secondly maybe for Sean, so you mentioned that we can\u2019t just take dig deeper that Kyprolis\u2019 outperforming expectation given that the timeline has been delayed already. So, just confirm your view on this? Does that mean also the compared arm, which is (inaudible) is also doing better than the expectation when the trial was designed? Thank you. Tony Hooper : So let me take that inventory question first. When we look at the average days on hand for 2013 they already fall around 13 days. So, we don\u2019t think the 13 days is going to be changing much as we go forward that should be up average days as we expect them. Sean Harper :  Yes. And again with the situation with these trials again you know when we make these, these are event driven studies and always when we make these estimates of when we expect the events to accrue there is pretty big component around that and as you get closer they narrow. But then as you get towards the end, it becomes really again very -- so you might have one month you will have nine events, the next month you have two then you have seven then you have one. It\u2019s that kind of thing where drawing a projection from those kind of data is very difficult. I don\u2019t think there is what I have learned over the years 20 years of doing this is you can speculate a lot when you are blinded to this kind of thing and say well all this could be happen because the treatment effect of the drug is bigger or the control arm is doing better or the base line population is just sicker or less sick than you expect, but you actually have no way of figuring out that based on a blinded situation that we are in. And I think it\u2019s just, you just have wait to get the data. It\u2019s frustrating I know, but you just have to wait and to look the data when we get it. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies. Eun Yang - Jefferies:  Thank you. So, based on what we hear from docs, the average baseline LDL levels in the outcome study for PCS skin inhibitor that could be lower than 100 milligram per deciliter. The question is, are there ultra low LDL levels where no further CD benefits can be gained? Sean Harper :  So, first of all I don\u2019t know where that information comes from because it\u2019s difficult for anybody to know what the average LDL level is accruing in these trials by running individual studies centers and lab theaters may have their own individual experiences. But in general what you want to be doing here is targeting people who are still well above the range of the sort of 70 or below that are still the target that people are looking for even the new guidelines that are not suppose to be target based mentioned repeatedly 70 and the reason for 70 is largely because when you get below 70 you start to seeing the reversal of that (inaudible) is relevant just hoping it\u2019s progression. So the question of whether I mean certainly in absolute terms as you begin to go lower and lower in LDL the absolute amount of benefit that you\u2019d expect to gain with (inaudible) for example does go down. But in percentage terms it\u2019s been maintained as far as it\u2019s been possible to push LDL. And then large outcome studies with intensive therapy there as you might imagine is the big bell curve of response in terms of LDL lowering and the lower end of that bell curve, the tail of that bell curve those individuals get push down quite low in terms of LDL. And those individuals appear for us to have to the extent that you can make these assessments in a subgroup like that they appear to have the same degree of benefit and they appear not to suffer any adverse effects. Certainly the genetic data all suggest strongly in humans that there would not be a breakdown this relationship between LDL and outcomes or that the safety would be problematic because it is clear humans can have a very low LDL levels and be just fine most of us are born just to remind you with LDL levels in the 20s and they climb over time with diet, so on. So, I think we\u2019re exploring new frontiers here, push LDL levels down to and test whether the lower is better, hypothesis continues to be true as you get into uncharted water. My prediction is that it will, but we have to generate the data to see. Bob Bradway : Can we have couple more questions, Marvin? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird. Chris Raymond - Robert Baird : Thanks. Just a question on XGEVA, you guys have mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are still seeing some generic, Zometa sort of impact. I think it\u2019s been over a year, I think now since the first generic Zometa launch and at least, as far as I understand, the impact is most acute in the first two, full quarters of that availability, which I would have thought might have washed out. Can you maybe sort of talk about what other impact you are seeing here? Tony Hooper : Chris, this is Tony. So in the U.S., we saw market share in units grow from about 42% to 43% quarter-on-quarter and we saw the dollar value market share growth from 70% to 76% quarter-on-quarter. Zometa went generic in about March last year. When you think about the ASP plus 6 reporting situation, it\u2019s calculated on a rolling 12-month reported two quarters in areas. So by definition, your ASP impact is anywhere between 12 months to 18 months. Chris Raymond - Robert Baird : Okay. Thank you. Tony Hooper :  Sure. Bob Bradway :  Yes, go ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek with Stifel. Joel Sendek - Stifel: Hi, thanks. Sorry, if you might have already mentioned this, but what\u2019s the total inventory draw down for the quarter? And then when might you start or restart the share repurchase? Bob Bradway : Okay. Why don\u2019t we take that in two parts, Joe. Tony has talked about inventory, but let\u2019s go back through for him. Tony Hooper : Let me remind you again that historically our fourth quarter has always been slightly higher than the first quarter. What we did see in 2013 at the end was a strange week at the end with about $120 million of additional buying by both wholesalers and end user customers. We think all of this has worked through the system during quarter one and we entered quarter two without any excess inventory. Sean Harper : Joel with respect to buybacks, we\u2019re not expecting any major activity this year. But again cash flow growth was attractive in the first quarter and we'll continue to look for ways to return that to our shareholders as appropriate through a mix of dividend growth and buybacks. Bob Bradway : Marvin, let's take two more questions. Operator : The first question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink. Howard Liang - Leerink: Thanks very much. Couple of questions for Sean, first is on Europe thoughts and about filings for T-VEC given the OS data. I know you're still talking to regulators, but your thoughts on that would be great. Second, blinatumomab, you already have all the data to potentially file, I know you\u2019re presenting at ASCO, would that be the registrational data? Sean Harper : Yes. So T-VEC, we really are fresh with the data and I think that there is little question that we could file, the questions we have to understand more about the product in its current form with the formulation and the data that we have in hand from a single study in monotherapy with physicians, regulators, payers and figure out what the best way to proceed is. We have a lot of sense of value to this product over time as an important potentially kind of cornerstone therapy and immuno-therapy. So we want to make sure that we proceed in the best way possible for this from a long term view stance. With blinatumomab, we clearly feel at this point that the data set that we\u2019ve generated is worthy of consideration for the filing data we have in hand for filing an approval and that\u2019s the discussion we are begging to have with regulators is around data set that we actually have in hand. Now that said, of course we\u2019re always stimulating more data. As you might the recall, we actually started a randomized control Phase III in the same population and that will be accruing and we have pediatric program et cetera, et cetera. So all of those data continue to accrue and all of that information would be submitted in the filing whenever we determine that data cut-off date. Bob Bradway : Okay. Let\u2019s take our final question, Marvin. Operator : Final question comes from the line of Boris Peaker with Oppenheimer. Boris Peaker - Oppenheimer: Thank you for squeezing me in. I just have a question on GCSF franchise, specifically how are the competitors in the U.S. and Europe positioning themselves in the market and what you see their strategy for gaining share in the future over the next few years? And do you see them talking or you are aware of them talking to insurance companies or is that coming back to you in some way in any kind of discussion, just kind of general thoughts on that market intelligence? Tony Hooper : So it\u2019s tough for me to comment on the competitive strategy bars, I mean [propose better] to talk to them. But obviously as you know in the U.S. (inaudible) is not a biosimilar, it has a very different label to our product and their positioning has been around different product, different price. In Europe they have the same situation, they are having to lean upon their label which is different to ours and in both cases, the Amgen\u2019s label is broader. Amgen label has more years of experience, much more data around, both efficacy and safety and we have an incredible track record of delivering quality product on plan every time. Boris Peaker - Oppenheimer: Have you adjusted your marketing method to some extent to counter detail to (inaudible)? Tony Hooper :  No, we still talk about the fact that we have the longest level of data available, we have the highest quality product available. Bob Bradway :  Well thanks for dialing in. Arvind will be around to take questions that you didn\u2019t get anything on the call. We appreciate your interest. Thanks. Operator :  Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Amgen\u2019s first quarter and financial results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator instructions.] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, vice president of investor relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Okay, thank you, Marvin. Good afternoon, everybody. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our conference call to review our operating results for the second quarter. Our new CFO, and my new boss, David Meline, actually picked a great quarter to join us, as our business performance was strong across the board. Our CEO, Bob Bradway will introduce David formally in just a couple of minutes, and will also review our strategic progress and actions we are taking to position ourselves for long term growth. Following Bob, David will review our second quarter performance. Our head of global commercial operations, Tony Hooper, will then discuss our product performance during the quarter and trends that we see going forward. Following Tony, our head of R&D, Sean Harper will provide a brief update on the many late-stage opportunities we have in our pipeline, as well as progress we are making on regulatory submissions. After Sean\u2019s comments, Bob will make a few concluding comments, and then we should have plenty of time for Q&A. We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by email. You will notice that we have made some significant additions to our quarterly slide deck. This change was made in the spirit of providing more disclosure to further your understanding of our product trend drivers. And of course this will give my friend Mark Schoenebaum something to talk about in his next few weekly videos.  Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Bob Bradway : Thank you, Arvind. Let me begin by welcoming David Meline as our chief financial officer. David joins us from 3M, and his financial leadership and broad international experience will be very helpful to Amgen as we execute our strategy for long term growth and launch our pipeline of medicines in a number of new geographies. I\u2019d also like to thank Michael Kelly for serving as our acting CFO prior to David\u2019s appointment. Our performance was strong across the board in the second quarter, and our confidence in the business is buoyed by our 11% revenue growth, 30% operating income growth, and 25% earnings per share growth for the period. Our recently launched and legacy brands performed well in the U.S. and in internationally, and we exercised expense discipline across the business to drive these results. Based on our progress through the first half of the year, and our confidence in the underlying trends of the business, we\u2019re raising guidance, as David will explain shortly.  Because we\u2019ll be talking on this call both about our quarterly results and some restructuring activity, I\u2019d like to take just a moment to set some strategic context. Our strategy for long term growth begins with a commitment to developing a robust, differentiated pipeline of new medicines addressing serious illness. This strategy is beginning to bear fruit. We\u2019ve talked about our substantial portfolio of 10 late-stage molecules delivering pivotal data by 2016. So far in 2014, we\u2019ve reported positive pivotal data for five of these molecules and we have submitted two of them already in the U.S., ivabradine for chronic heart failure, and TVEC for malignant melanoma.  In Q3, we expect to submit evolocumab in the U.S. and Europe, TVEC in Europe, and later in the year, blinatumomab in the U.S. with a breakthrough therapy designation. This presents us with the prospect of several high-potential new product launches beginning in 2015. To capitalize on this opportunity, we announced today the first steps of a restructuring plan designed to improve our focus and proactively reallocate resources ahead of the commercialization of our many promising molecules, on a cost-competitive basis. Our initial efforts include streamlining our organization, reducing layers of management, increasing managerial spans of responsibility, and beginning implementation of a revised geographic site plan. In this regard, we\u2019ll reduce our workforce by between 2,400 and 2,900 positions, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing through 2015, predominantly in the United States. This represents approximately 12% to 15% of Amgen\u2019s global workforce of some 20,000 staff members.  A significant element of our current restructuring plan involves optimizing our sites in the United States. As part of this, we plan to close all of our facilities in Washington and Colorado before the end of 2015. We\u2019ll begin the process of exiting these sits in the third quarter of this year. These sites were primarily research and development and manufacturing facilities. Going forward, we see opportunities to concentrate more of our research and process development activities in our sites in South San Francisco and Cambridge, Massachusetts, obviously two key biotechnology hubs. We will retain our headquarters in Thousand Oaks, albeit with a reduced number of staff and overall, we anticipate approximately a 23% reduction in our facilities footprint as part of this first step in our restructuring. These actions will result in pretax accounting charges in the range of $775 million to $950 million, primarily incurred in 2014 and 2015. The combination of these actions will reduce operating expenses by approximately $700 million in 2016 as compared to 2013, although most of the savings will be reinvested to support global launches of our new products. These actions were contemplated as part of our 2014 guidance, and the financial benefit will be modest in 2015 due to the timing of these actions during the calendar year.  Let me just point out that the initiatives I\u2019ve described represent the first steps in our strategic resource reallocation efforts. For much of the past year, teams across Amgen have engaged in a coordinated effort to reengineer our company for the future. They are focused on ensuring that we build exactly the right capabilities to deliver on our strategy and our aspirations. As part of this, we\u2019ve been evaluating our overall expense base : our fixed costs, our variable costs, our labor-related expenses, and our financing costs. Our next steps, which are well underway, include evaluating additional efficiency initiatives, particularly in the shared services area. We\u2019ll discuss our full program with you together with an estimate of the resulting cost savings, pipeline progress, and our commercial plans during a business review meeting that we will be hosting in the fourth quarter. I want to emphasize today that we begin these actions with a strong underlying confidence in our business. Our confidence is bolstered by our strong operating performance and the widespread positive reception to our evolocumab data and by our expectations for the well-designed ASPIRE trial for Kyprolis, the results for which will be announced as soon as they are available. Let me now turn to the call over to David Meline, who will walk you through the financials for our second quarter. David Meline : Thanks, Bob. I\u2019m pleased to join Amgen at this pivotal time. I look forward to working with the team in order to support the global growth of the company while helping to prioritize the best opportunities for products and programs which will serve the company\u2019s mission. We will also ensure that the company is efficient and lean in order to maintain competitiveness and support our capital allocation plans. I look forward to expanding on these themes during the fourth quarter business review. Turning to page five of the presentation, Amgen\u2019s revenue grew by 11% year over year, with 8% product sales growth, driven by strength across the product portfolio, both in the U.S. and internationally. We also saw a nearly $150 million increase in other revenues, primarily due to our Nexavar and [Stivagar] partnerships. On a quarter over quarter basis, revenues grew 15%. This is consistent with our product sales pattern in recent years. However, the increase was a bit sharper this year in part due to inventory build for Enbrel of about $60 million in Q2, which Tony will discuss in more detail shortly. Operating income grew 30%, based on the combination of solid revenue growth along with reduced operating expenses, which were down year over year. Within operating expenses, cost of sales increased by 0.4 points to 15.9% of sales, due to the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax. Research and development expenses increased by 4% year over year, driven by the addition of the Onyx programs, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with support of marketed products.  SG&A expenses decreased by 12%, driven by significant reduction in Enbrel related expenses. Other income and expenses were $144 million in the quarter, which was flat year over year. Tax rate for the quarter was 16.2%, a 4.3 point increase versus the second quarter of 2013, due primarily to the geographic earnings mix and the absence of the R&D tax credit versus the year ago period. As a result, adjusted net income increased 26% for the quarter, and adjusted earnings per share increased 25%.  Now, turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page six. We generated $2.1 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter of 2014, a $600 million year over year increase due primarily to the impact of higher sales and improvements in working capital. Dividend payments in the quarter totaled $0.5 billion, reflecting the 30% year over year dividend increase. At quarter end, Amgen held over $26 billion in cash and short-term investments, up over $4 billion versus a year ago, and our debt balance was $33 billion. The quarter end debt and cash balances include the impact of prefunding a majority of our $2 billion debt maturity later this year. Turning to page seven, Amgen is increasing its revenue guidance for 2014 to $19.5 billion to $19.7 billion, and adjusted EPS guidance to $8.20 to $8.40. We are reaffirming our tax rate guidance of 15% to 16% for the year, which assumes that the R&D tax credit will be extended in 2014, and applied retroactively to the full year. At this point, our best view on timing is that the R&D tax credit extension would happen in the fourth quarter, which would result in a lower tax rate in Q4 as compared to the first three quarters of 2014. Our guidance on capital expenditures remains unchanged. Finally, on slide eight, we see a summary of the financial impacts from the restructuring announced today. Specifically, we will be incurring pretax GAAP charges of $775 million to $950 million in 2014 and 2015. In the second half of 2014, we expect an EPS impact of $0.36 to $0.45 per share on a GAAP basis, with the balance occurring substantially in 2015. Roughly 40% of total expenses will be on a cash basis.  Based on the timing of the program, savings for 2014 are reflected in the full year guidance, and as a reminder, operating expenses tend to be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year, and we expect that again to occur in 2014.  While capital investments will also be required as part of these restructuring actions, we are maintaining our capital investment guidance for 2014 and in the future, expect to fund these investments within the capital expense run rate of approximately $800 million. We look forward to discussing our full program in greater detail at our business review meeting in the fourth quarter. Let me now turn this over to Tony. Tony Hooper : Thanks, David. You\u2019ll find a summary of our global sales performance for the second quarter on slide number 10. The strong underlying demand we saw in quarter one continued into quarter two as our legacy product franchisees remained stable despite new competition and our growth phase products continued to increase demand from both share and market growth. As a result, we delivered 8% year on year sales growth in quarter two, driven by solid unit demand, and to a lesser extent, price, as shown on slide number 11. You will recall that last year, we realized the benefit of a Medicaid rebate adjustment in the amount of $185 million, which [inevitably] impacted the year on year comparison this year by about 4 percentage points. This adjustment mostly impacted our [unintelligible] and [filgrastim] products.  Our performance was particularly strong in the international markets, with 15% year on year growth driven by strong performance in Europe, and we also benefited from the acquisition of the filgrastim rights from Roche in several new and emerging markets. Now to slide 12, where on a sequential basis, sales grew 14% due to the rebound of the inventory dynamic for quarter one and solid unit demand. We exited quarter two with wholesale inventory levels within our normal range. Let\u2019s review our second quarter product performance, beginning with Neulasta and NEUPOGEN, on slides 13 and 14. Neulasta sales were relatively flat year on year. Positive contribution from price was partially offset by the positive Medicaid rebate adjustment in quarter two of last year. This Medicaid rebate adjustment also negatively impacted NEUPOGEN sales, as they were down 9% year on year. To date, we\u2019ve only seen a slight impact from the new filgrastim competition in both the U.S. and Europe. Turning now to Enbrel, on slides 15 and 16. Underlying demand continued to be strong, as sales were up 7% year on year, primarily driven by price. Most of the inventory dynamic we saw last quarter has worked its way through the channel. At the end of quarter two we did see a slight inventory build of about $60 million that we expect to be drawn down in quarter three. We continue to see strong segment growth in both rheumatology and dermatology at 19% and 21% respectively. And we held value share in both segments quarter on quarter, as shown on slide number 17. Now to slide 18. EPOGEN sales were up 2% year on year, as price were partially offset by last year\u2019s Medicaid rebate adjustment. Unit demand has been relatively stable, as we continue to monitor average hemoglobin levels and dose utilization under the bundled payment system. Aranesp was down 1% year on year, as shown on slide 19. Underlying demand for Aranesp continues to decrease slightly due to practice patterns in both oncology and nephrology in the U.S. and due to price competition pressures in Europe. Turning now to slide 20, the combined denosumab franchise grew 29% year on year with a 31% unit growth. Prolia grew 40% year on year, due to strong unit demand, as we continue to grow share in all markets. In the U.S., our improved sales force focus on high-prescribing physicians continues to drive both [unintelligible] and [unintelligible] prescriptions. In fact, new patient Rx is up 33% year on year, and our DTC programs are driving increases in patient awareness and patient requests. As a result, in the U.S. we grew market share as measured by days of therapy by 3 percentage points in the quarter, up to 17%, shown on slide 21. U.S. repeat injection rates are over 60% on second injection and over 70% on third injections, leading to a 50% increase in repeat patients versus a year ago. XGEVA grew 20% year on year, due to strong unit demand. XGEVA continues to capture market share in a growing market, despite competition from generic zoledronic acid, as shown on slide number 22. Our focus with prescribers on the superior clinical efficacy profile of XGEVA continues to drive growth.  Now to Sensipar, which continues to grow, and is now annualizing at a run rate of about $1.2 billion. As a result of increased patient penetration, Q2 sales grew 15% year on year. Growth included both unit demand and price. Nplate grew 12% year over year, mainly due to a high unit demand and strong market growth across all regions. Vectibix sales grew 42% year on year, driven by strong unit demand across all regions. Vectibix is now the only EGFR agent approved with improved overall survival data for first line metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with an [unintelligible] based regimen of [unintelligible], in [unintelligible] patients, and will address an important unmet need in these patients. Finally, Kyprolis sales were up 15% globally, and 23% in the U.S. on a sequential basis. In the U.S., roughly half of this growth is due to unit demand, and the other half due to return to normal inventory levels versus last quarter. Kyprolis continues to maintain a dominant share in the third line multiple myeloma setting. We expect the next major inflection point for Kyprolis will be upon the inclusion of second line data in the label, and look forward to reviewing the Aspire data in the near future. As we enter into the second half of the year, we\u2019ve made very good progress on a number of fronts. I will conclude my prepared comments where I began. Our legacy products remain stable, despite new competition, and our growth phase products continue to benefit from higher demand and increased market share. Let me pass you to Sean. Sean Harper : Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. We continue to advance our pipeline, so let me begin with an update on cardiovascular programs, beginning with evolocumab our PCSK9 antibody. We\u2019re busy preparing our evolocumab submission for dyslipidemia and are targeting submissions in the U.S. and E.U. this quarter. These submissions for evolocumab will include both Q2 week and Q2 monthly dosing. However, in order to maximize the probability of a first cycle approval for evolocumab delivered via our auto-injector, we\u2019ve decided to not include our automated mini doser device in the initial submission. Rather, the plan is to submit the device file as a supplement shortly after the initial approval of evolocumab. We also had the opportunity to present data from our evolocumab Phase III Tesla study in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and our Phase II/III [unintelligible] study in severe familial hypercholesterolemia at the European Atherosclerosis Society meeting last month. These data generated a lot of excitement, and we continue to explore the potential for evolocumab in these severely affected patient populations. In addition, we have completed our submission of ivabradine in the U.S. for chronic heart failure, an epidemic condition with a high degree of unmet need, based on a large data set including outcomes data. We anticipate that the successful launch of evolocumab and ivabradine will meaningfully benefit many patients at cardiovascular risk. We are look forward to new Kyprolis data including a review by an independent data monitoring committee of an interim analysis of the Aspire study in relapsed multiple myeloma patients and the final analysis of the Focus study in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. In both of these event-driven studies, our current estimates are that these analyses will occur in the third quarter.  We\u2019ve also completed enrollment in Endeavor, our Phase III head to head comparison of Kyprolis with dexamethasone to VELCADE with dexamethasone in relapsed multiple myeloma. Our immuno-oncology programs continue to advance, and we had several data presentations at ASCO. We presented the overall survival data from our Phase III TVEC study in metastatic melanoma, which demonstrated a 4.4 month improvement in overall survival, which closely approached statistical significance. We believe this trend, along with the successful result of our durable response rate primary endpoint, make for a very compelling data set, and we recently submitted a BLA for this agent in the U.S., and are planning a European submission in the third quarter, for regionally and distantly metastatic melanoma. In addition, we continue to believe that there\u2019s the compelling opportunity for TVEC to prime the immune system with checkpoint inhibitors. We\u2019re currently investigating TVEC in combination with [unintelligible], or [unintelligible], in a Phase IB/II metastatic melanoma study. The Phase IB portion was presented at ASCO, and while a small study, the encouraging response rate we reported, along with no new or unexpected toxicities, generated a lot of interest. We\u2019re also move forward aggressively with our collaborative efforts with Merck on PD1, and expect to begin combination studies later this year. We also presented the blinatumomab confirmatory Phase II results in relapsed refractory adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia at ASCO. We\u2019re preparing a submission in the U.S. where we were granted breakthrough therapy designation this year, and are also in discussions with regulators about our E.U. submission. Our Phase II study of Vectibix versus Avastin in first line wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer suggested a survival advantage for Vectibix in this population, which also garnered interest at ASCO. As you will recall, we recently received U.S. approval for first line use with [unintelligible] in wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer.  Our accelerated approval for monotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer was also converted to full approval at that time.  Regarding the ongoing Trebananib Phase II study in recurrent ovarian cancer, our latest estimates for the results from this event-driven overall survival secondary endpoint is now the fourth quarter of this year. Recall that Trebananib is a peptibody that inhibits Ang 1 and 2, and the primary endpoint of progression-free survival was met last year. Our psoriasis program for brodalumab, which we\u2019re developing with our partners at AstraZeneca, consisted of three Phase III studies, one placebo controlled and two head to head studies comparing it to ustekinumab, or STELARA. The efficacy data we will be reporting from the placebo controlled study was very positive, and the other two studies will read out in the fourth quarter. The results from our Phase II study in psoriatic arthritis with brodalumab were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine, and as we have announced, we and our partners have initiated two Phase III studies in psoriatic arthritis to evaluate the impact of brodalumab on improving clinical signs and symptoms as well as the ability to prevent joint damage. As you heard from us earlier this month, AMG 416, the intravenous calcimimetic we gained access to via the acquisition of KAI Pharmaceuticals, had a very positive top line result from the first of three Phase III studies in secondary hyperparathyroidism. We look forward to seeing the second placebo controlled study in the third quarter, as well as the result of a head to head comparison to Sensipar in the first half of next year. Secondary hyperparathyroidism can be a challenging disease to manage, and we believe there\u2019s an important role for an effective calcimimetic that can be administered intravenously coincident with hemodialysis. Turning to a couple of our earlier stage programs, we were pleased to see Phase I asthma data from our anti-TSLP, or thymic stromal lymphopoeitin monoclonal antibody AMG 157 also highlighted in the New England Journal recently. We\u2019re developing this molecule in partnership with AstraZeneca MedImmune, and we believe this program has the potential to help address the large unmet need in asthma. And as a quick update on our CGRP receptor antibody, AMG 334, we\u2019ve completed enrollment in our Phase IIB dose ranging study in episodic migraine patients and expect to see these data later this year. Our Phase IIB chronic migraine study with AMG 334 continues to enroll. Finally, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank my Amgen colleagues for our continued progress toward advancing these new potential medicines for patients in need. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay, thank you, Sean. Before turning to questions, let me just take a moment to put the many parts of our business into a single perspective as we move along the strategic path that we first outlined for you in 2011.  First, we\u2019re focused on bringing forward a substantial portfolio of innovative molecules that address significant unmet medical needs in areas of grievous illness, and molecules that demonstrate large, clinically relevant effects and are supported where possible by human genetic validation. Second, we\u2019re building our business infrastructure to bring medicines to patients all around the world, shifting resources to areas of highest value and growth. And finally, we\u2019re making these investments for growth as we continue to meet our commitments to grow revenues and earnings and return capital to our shareholders.  And we\u2019ll look forward to providing more granularity on our progressing pipeline, our commercial plans for launching new products, our expansion activities, and so forth, when we\u2019re together for the business review meeting during the fourth quarter. So with that, let\u2019s turn to the question and answer session and Marvin, perhaps you can remind our callers of the procedure that will follow. Operator : [Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison - Morgan Stanley : I wanted to ask specifically about the restructuring and what you indicated was potentially its impact on the guidance for this year. If I go and I look, you, at the low end, had about a $0.30 improvement in EPS and at the high end you bumped by $0.20. And if I take a look at that based upon your margin structure, that you didn\u2019t change in your guidance, it looks like on an annualized basis that\u2019s around $30 million to $165 million. Of that $700 million, is that what you expect will actually fall through to the bottom line, and the rest is, you know, in terms of increased R&D or SG&A expense, to launch these new products? Bob Bradway : I guess a couple of things perhaps to help you think through the modeling. First, as I said in my remarks, the restructuring announcement that we made today was contemplated when we gave initial 2014 guidance, so I wouldn\u2019t expect that you\u2019d be adjusting your 2014 guidance as a result of today\u2019s announcement, because as I said, we had these in mind when we provided 2014 guidance. And I\u2019d just reiterate what David said, which is bear in mind that it\u2019s typical for our second quarter operating margin to be the highest for us of the year, and we expect that there will be some increase in operating expenses, as normal in the third and fourth quarter, and perhaps a little bit more than usual, as we begin investing in the prelaunch activities for the medicines that we\u2019ve filed. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank : I have one question regarding AMG 416. Regarding the head to head study you are doing comparing to Sensipar, what do you expect to see from this trial, apart from the primary endpoint? Which other secondary endpoint should we look at as well? And then do you expect to conduct an outcomes study for this [unintelligible]. Sean Harper : I would say that the comparison to Sensipar is important because we need to understand both at an efficacy, a tolerability, and an adherence over time, how the products compare. And I think all of those are important, just understanding the sort of biochemical activity of the dosing that we\u2019ve chosen for AMG 114 versus the current Sensipar dosing, understanding the tolerability issues, which as you know, are quite limiting for Sensipar, given the large [unintelligible] that these hemodialysis patients face. And finally, the adherence issue, which of course is related to tolerability, but not directly.  So these are all the things that we\u2019d be looking at to try to understand where AMG 416 should be positioned to help patients and physicians manage the issues associated with these patients. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company : Maybe for Bob, on the restructuring, I guess I understand that you don\u2019t want to be too specific until the business review meeting, but should we generally take it to mean that you\u2019re redeploying investment in R&D toward SG&A? And if that\u2019s the case, do you think you can bring Amgen\u2019s targeted R&D down to more in line with your large biopharma peers? Bob Bradway : Let me just make clear that the changes we announced today are company-wide changes. So while the facilities, particularly in Washington and to an extent in Colorado, that we\u2019re closing, are primarily research and development and process development related. The cuts themselves are companywide, and some of the launch investments will relate to research and development activities, and obviously the bulk of it over time to commercial activities.  So we\u2019re reallocating away from some of our lower return areas into what we expect to be higher growth, higher return opportunities for us. So that\u2019s how I\u2019d characterize it. And you\u2019re right, in the context of our full business review we\u2019ll able to, I think, spend enough time with you to elaborate on how we expect the cost structure to evolve as we reshape the business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs : Was just wondering if there are any new pieces of clinical data that you\u2019re expecting that might change the level of reinvestment either up or down that you\u2019ve cited in your restructuring. And then another question, Bob, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the well-designed Aspire trial. I was wondering if you would care to expand here, as we feel that there are a number of questions on some of the limitations of the trial design and just wondering if you could help us out there. Bob Bradway : I\u2019ll perhaps take your question in two pieces. Why don\u2019t I take the first part and then Sean can elaborate on the R&D question and the Aspire question in particular. Our expectation again is that the reception to our evolocumab data has been very positive, so we look forward to continuing to advance that, and to begin investing in the kinds of activities that would be typical before the launch of such a medicine. In addition, we shared incremental information with you on this call about our other cardiovascular medicine, ivabradine, and Sean, I think, was pretty clear about the steps that we\u2019re taking with our oncology medicines and AMG 416.  So on the basis of those molecules, and the progress we\u2019ve made against them, we feel it\u2019s time now to reallocate resources, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re preparing to do. But Sean, if you want to elaborate on any of the specific incremental programs that we\u2019ve embarked on, or talk about Aspire? Sean Harper : Of course, fundamentally, we look at each of the clinical trial results that we get on major late-stage programs, and the emerging pipeline as well, and make investment decisions accordingly. So that\u2019s kind of the name of the game. It\u2019s a little bit hard to anticipate. You can get disappointed and invest less, and things can look better than you think and you invest more. So I don\u2019t know how else to address that. In terms of Aspire, I think that Bob is reflecting this sense that the R&D organization has about the Aspire study, in general terms, which is I would agree entirely, and do agree, that the study is well-designed. It\u2019s always possible to criticize study designs, and many different ways to design studies for the same basic objectives. Obviously, Aspire is designed to help us to understand the incremental benefit that occurs by adding Kyprolis to a [rev dex] standard of care background in this population. So I think likely, if there are real specific questions around the study design, we could talk about that offline. But I would agree that it\u2019s a well-designed study. Bob Bradway : It\u2019s a large study, 800 patients. Sean Harper : And I think we expect it to provide a pretty good window into the truth about the molecules. That\u2019s what I would expect from a well-designed study. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Sanford Bernstein. Geoffrey Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein : I hate to come back to this, Bob, but I\u2019m still confused about the effect of the restructuring. And could I ask you, are you suggesting to us that the operating expenses net will be flat in 2015 and 2016 because you\u2019ll take R&D down and SG&A will go up to prepare for these cardiovascular launches? Or are you suggesting that the operating expense ratio will be constant in 2015, 2016, with that same reallocation. Because I\u2019m struggling to understand what it means. Bob Bradway : What we were trying to convey is that the changes that we\u2019ve announced in this first step of restructuring would aggregate to $700 million of operating expense when compared to 2013. So the things that we\u2019re eliminating, for example, were [$700 million] dollars of operating expenses in 2013. Now, what we\u2019re planning to do is to reallocate much of that to the activities associated with the molecules that we\u2019ve begun filing. So you\u2019re right, what we\u2019re saying is first, in 2014, we had contemplated these actions, and they take place late in the calendar year, so this doesn\u2019t really affect the outlook for 2014. With respect to 2015, again, the actions will begin to accrue benefits for us through the course of the year, and by 2016, we think we will be through the actions that we\u2019ve disclosed. And so the full benefit of these actions would be available, therefore we\u2019ll have an order of magnitude of $700 million in that year, some portion of which, most of which, we expect to invest in launch activities for the molecules that we\u2019re filing. So assuming those activities continue to proceed as we expect them to, we would plan to reinvest most of that in the business, in that year. Now, one of the things, just to reiterate, the restructuring that we\u2019ve announced is company-wide, so we\u2019re reallocating resources away not just from research and development, but from across the business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Josh Schimmer - Piper Jaffray : I guess just on a high level or conceptual basis, as we think about 2015 and 2016, do we think of these as transition years between the mature franchise and the emerging pipeline? Or are you confident you can still deliver meaningful EPS growth over that time? Bob Bradway : Yeah, as I said in my remarks, our objective is to continue to grow the business and to continue to increase our returns for shareholders, including to increase our dividend during this period. So that\u2019s our objective, and this restructuring doesn\u2019t reflect any change to that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber of Citi. Yaron Werber - Citi : If you don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s sort of two quick ones. One, just for you, Bob, when you look at Amgen historically, Amgen has had really a great franchise and very much monopoly dominant position. This company historically has not had to compete in a lot of markets maybe outside of inflammation. You know, the markets you\u2019re going to go into are going to be a lot more competitive, and I just want to understand how you sort of position the company for that.  And then secondly, if you don\u2019t mind, just evolocumab, the decision to sort of split up the two formulations, what was the reason for that? The filing of the two formulations. Bob Bradway : Why don\u2019t I take the first part of the competitive dynamic, and I\u2019ll ask Tony to add in his thoughts. And then Sean can reiterate his comments on evolocumab. But you\u2019re right, we\u2019re entering a new era in the sense that we will be entering into more competitive spaces than we have in the past, and that\u2019s something we\u2019ve been talking about here at Amgen over the course of the past couple of years.  And we\u2019re excited and looking forward to having the opportunity to show what we can do and competing in some of these competitively intense fields that we\u2019re entering. And again, we think we\u2019re entering these spaces with molecules that have large effect size, which are differentiated, and which form the basis of a clear approach for our developing these new product areas. Tony Hooper : You\u2019re right that initially Amgen specialized in building markets, as we did with both filgrastim and [unintelligible] franchise. But as you look back at the legacy portfolio, now our European team have been defending against a number of competitors in the market the last seven years. We truly have built a competitive skill and ability. When we look at Enbrel in the U.S. we compete on a daily basis against at least nine other competitors. And when we launched denosumab, we went into launch against a branded Zometa, which became generic at six competitors. We still grew market share against those. So I think we have built a skill over time to really be competitive, and this is what we\u2019re honing with the team now, again, as they go into new therapeutic areas, building therapeutic competence, understanding the relationships, and ensuring that we can be maximally competitive as we go to market. Sean Harper : And let me clarify on the issue around the evolocumab device. This is not a formulation issue. The formulation is the formulation that\u2019s going to be registered along with the every two week and every month dosing data. The auto-injector, which is the SureClick auto-injector, which we have many, many patient years of exposure and the regulators are very familiar, will also be registered. What we are not initially registering is the automated mini doser device, which administers the entire volume necessary for monthly injection as a single infusion. And the reason for that is to not take a chance, given the novelty of that device, as compared to our auto-injector, delaying the entire drug submission by including that rather than get it approved, get the auto-injector approved, get the product ready for launch, and then submit shortly after approval the device, which will be reviewed on a device clock, not a drug review clock. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group : I just had a question for Bob, and then just a quick clarification. There\u2019s been a lot of activity in the large pharma and specialty pharma space, which you guys kind of straddle that with biotech on the inversion front. And I know your tax rates are very low, but much of your cash is generated ex-U.S. and getting access to it is maybe a bit more complicated under ideal situations. So as a former and well-known banker, I\u2019d love to just know how you\u2019re thinking about inversions in general and whether or not Amgen might be interested in something like that, whether it makes sense or not. And then just a quick clarification for Tony. Tony, there\u2019s a lot going on with inventory this quarter, but I just want to be very clear. If one looks at the data on a year on year comparison, the increase in inventory year on year was negligible and you remain within the normal range, correct? Tony Hooper : The answer is, we ended the quarter within our normal range, with the only exception being Enbrel. There was about $60 million over the normal range, sequentially. Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group : And on a year over year basis, the build was very, very modest, correct? Tony Hooper : Correct. Yes. Bob Bradway : On your question, you\u2019re right, there\u2019s an awful lot of activity at the moment related to tax structuring. I guess the first thing I would observe is that our focus strategically is to try to advance molecules that we think we can add value to that address grievous illness. So that\u2019s where our energy is focused from a business development and capital allocation standpoint when we think outside of our own four walls. My take on the inversion activity is that unfortunately our country doesn\u2019t yet have a globally competitive corporate tax system or structure, and until that changes, I think there will be tax financial engineering related to transactions like those that we\u2019re seeing now. I hope that Congress will take action, and enact broad, sweeping corporate tax reform, but I\u2019m not optimistic that that will happen, certainly not this year. And again, I hope that even if corporate tax reform doesn\u2019t happen, that there may be a window for repatriation. But I think those two steps, corporate tax reform and repatriation, are important in order to create a level playing field for corporations, particularly like ours, in innovative industries. And I think that\u2019s what you see in biotechnology and pharmaceutical activity right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets : Maybe a question for Sean, going back to some [unintelligible] data, which is coming up. Maybe you could clarify for us, and I know there\u2019s multiple interims, so just wanted to clarify, is this a 50% or 75% interim? Did prior wins not stop? And should we have the full expectation that this one would stop, since you\u2019re so positive on the overall design? And then secondly, when this data comes out, what do you think is clinically meaningful here in second line, understanding it should be positive, but what would you be very pleased with? Sean Harper : This particular interim on Aspire comes up with a reasonable number of events and power. It\u2019s not, of course, fully powered, as the final analysis would be. And whether this study is well-designed or not has, in my view, nothing to do with the question of whether the result is going to be positive in an interim. It\u2019s the question of the statistical power that you have to detect the effect size. So depending on whether you\u2019re very ambitious and you\u2019re thinking about an effect size for the molecule on top of Rev Dex. You might imagine a positive interim at this stage. If you\u2019re more conservative about the effect size, you could imagine the study might have to run through to completion to show that effect size. You know, I hate to blurt out a number, because I\u2019ve had so many conversations with so many experts in this field, and I\u2019ve heard such a large range of answers from people about what they think would be meaningful. And largely, it\u2019s because they\u2019re doing some kind of back of the envelope comparison in their minds to what one might see in such an experiment with VELCADE. And this is not a VELCADE comparison study. That study\u2019s just enrolled fully, Endeavor, and will come later.  So we\u2019re going to see the data very soon, and I think I\u2019m just going to look at the data when it comes, and we have access to most of the really key opinion leaders in this disease around the world, and we\u2019ll have them help us understand how they feel about the results, assuming that we do get a read out, because the study is stopped early for efficacy. That may or may not occur at this [DSMB] review. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan : What can you tell us about the pace of commercial investments in evolocumab, just especially given the earlier filing? Tony Hooper : As Sean said earlier, we\u2019ve filed now for ivabradine, the drug for cardiac heart failure, which obviously will be the critical path to Amgen moving into the cardiovascular space. Clearly, that drug will potentially approved sometime early next year, and we\u2019re setting up the commercial launch to ready ourselves for that. That team of specialists, plus the medical organization, will be the same organization that then takes evolocumab to market a bit later during 2015. Geoff Meacham - JPMorgan: And then on the restructuring, the facilities footprint, is this mostly for legacy products? Does this change your view on the biosimilar opportunity, or other, let\u2019s say, more legacy kind of assets, in terms of their revenue potential? Bob Bradway : Great, thanks for asking that question. I want to make sure to be clear in my response that this doesn\u2019t, in any way, diminish our enthusiasm for the biosimilar portfolio that we\u2019re developing. I\u2019ll just remind you, we have six programs advancing, three of which are already in pivotal trial. So we\u2019re excited about the prospect of developing and launching those beginning in 2017. And you\u2019re right to point out that this gives us an opportunity to rationalize some of our manufacturing capability. And let me just, at a high level, remind you that we\u2019ve talked over the past couple of years about our investments in manufacturing technologies and new processes that we think will enable us to make protein therapies more reliably and at lower cost than what we currently do. And as we progress our investments in that area, we would expect that to free up some of our legacy manufacturing capacity. So we\u2019re exiting 20 year old manufacturing technologies and continuing to invest in what we think are state-of-the-art, cutting-edge technologies that will enable us to rationalize and, we think, make product more reliably and more cost effectively. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Matt Roden - UBS : I have one for Tony on the EPOGEN and dialysis market. As both branded and potentially biosimilars begin to come to market in the U.S., we wanted to get your thoughts on how you view the impact of some of the large dialysis providers and potential volume deals, and how you see that moving forward once Roche comes in and the biosimilars as well. Tony Hooper : So just to remind you again that Roche have the right to enter the market at present with MIRCERA, and then patent will expire during 2015. The market is divided into three large chunks. Obviously, [DaVita] and [FMC] each holding about a third of the business, and the other third being held or managed by some of the small providers. As regards DaVita, we have an exclusive supply contract with them that runs until 2018. And with FMC, we have a nonexclusive agreement at present. So obviously, all the experience at both FMC and a few of the others have had in Europe, which include a number of other alternative products, is something we take into act. We have continued to maintain a fairly large portion of the dialysis market share in Europe. So we\u2019re modeling ourselves on that, but the market, of course, in the U.S., is fundamentally different. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies. Eun Yang - Jefferies : Question on romosozumab 4785. In [Phase III], patients are treated with 785 for 12 months, then followed by 24 months of Prolia. Wouldn\u2019t that be less favorable for a primary outcome measure like 24 months compared to 24 months continuous [unintelligible] treatment? Sean Harper : I think that the science of this novel pathway really led us to that approach, and what we found in our Phase II work with romosozumab was that while one does see the most rapid increase in bone marrow density that has been seen with any agent that\u2019s been introduced into humans, it does plateau by a year. And by a year, essentially what one is experiencing with continued use of romosozumab is a antiresorptive effect, a kind of magnitude effect, that\u2019s generally similar to that which you would see with [unintelligible] resorptives. And so at that point, it didn\u2019t seem prudent to continue to dose people with an anabolic agent which has a novel mechanism, etc., when we had the ability to adopt a paradigm of rapidly building bone in patients who require that, and then kind of locking in those gains with an antiresorptive such as Prolia. So that was a surprise to us, of course, because this is completely novel biology and it wasn\u2019t until we got into the clinic and worked with an agent in Phase II that we found that it really wasn\u2019t sensible to use the product on a chronic basis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya from Nomura Securities. Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities : Just a question on the restructuring. Should we expect any sort of pipeline reprioritization, when we get to the business review meeting at the end of the year? And just as you think about 2016 and beyond, how much of the shift in spending, the SG&A, is sort of one-time, in support of launching of these products, and how much of it should we assume is recurring? Bob Bradway : I\u2019ll just remind you that we\u2019ve been doing a fair amount of reprioritization of the pipeline over the past two years, but Sean, you can reiterate the actions that we\u2019ve taken there if you\u2019d like. And of course we\u2019ll talk about where we\u2019re focusing our efforts when we\u2019re together for the full business review. And we\u2019d like to give you an update on our approaches in discovery research as well as the molecules that we\u2019re excited about at an earlier stage of development that we haven\u2019t had as much time to talk about, given the bolus of advanced molecules that we\u2019re currently developing. And similarly, I\u2019d ask that rather than getting into the details now of our investment in competitive molecules, that we\u2019ll use the business review at year-end, or in the fourth quarter, as an opportunity to update you on our thinking. But you\u2019ll appreciate that the initial stages before launch of a molecule include considerable amount of investment prior to actually generating revenues. Sean? Sean Harper : I think it\u2019s obvious to folks that we have an unprecedented number of late-stage programs rolling through at the moment. And this is the nature of R&D at any given company. It tends to be lumpy in this way. And so as you\u2019re absorbing, first, enormous amounts of Phase III clinical trial expenses, those, of course, as a bolus like this moves through, they begin to roll off. But the R&D expenses associated with supporting commercialization and the pharmacovigilance and regulatory activities, etc., in addition to supporting the new geographies that we\u2019re moving into, are substantial investments. And then while we may not have this number of molecules at any given time, at steady state, in late-stage development, we certainly want to have plenty. And so we\u2019re going to be continuing to make significant investment, both in internal innovation, as well as to be looking externally to make sure we\u2019re capturing innovation appropriately. If you look at our late-stage portfolio right now, it definitely represents a mix of those two capabilities. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Ravi Mehrotra - Credit Suisse : Sorry, another one on the headcount reduction. Thanks for all the color. You\u2019ve partly answered this. But let me ask from a very philosophical perspective. Is the headcount principally being driven to squeeze out operational inefficiencies, or with a greater goal of gaining new structural advantages with a view of dominating select R&D and operational domains? And if it\u2019s the second of these, are there any subtleties in the restructuring that you can highlight which we may miss in just the headline headcount reduction numbers? Bob Bradway : Ravi, I think in our disclosure of the reductions, we were clear and transparent about what our objectives for the move are. And again, what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re carefully, selectively reallocating resources away from some of our legacy investment areas to some of these new areas that we think offer higher growth and better returns. And again, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of subtlety to it. We try to be quite clear and transparent about what we\u2019re trying to do, both as regards the numbers, the locations, and what we\u2019re trying to do with our fixed costs from a site standpoint. So again, I expect when we\u2019re together in the fourth quarter, if there\u2019s need for more insight on the actions that we will have taken, or will be in the process of taking, we can provide that for you. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink Swann. Howard Liang - Leerink Swann : Can you talk about what additional commercial infrastructure you think you\u2019ll need in order to launch evolocumab and other products? And with the $700 million benefit from the restructuring, would that be sufficient? Or do you think you\u2019ll need more buildup from other investments to build the infrastructure? Tony Hooper : It\u2019s clearly a very sensitive and competitive debate we\u2019ll have about this now, but we are looking at putting together a definitive cardiovascular team and that team will evolve over time as we then go from ivabradine to evolocumab. The other products we\u2019ll be launching fall pretty much within our existing organization in terms of the oncology skills. But that\u2019s about as much as we would want to disclose at this point in time. Arvind Sood : :",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speakers prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Thank you, Marvin. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our third quarter conference call. Unlike past quarters, our format today will be a bit different. As we are conducting a comprehensive business review tomorrow morning, we\u2019ll limit our comments to reviewing our solid performance during the third quarter and keep this call brief to about 30 minutes, including taking some of your questions. Joining me today are Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO; and our CFO, David Meline, who will both make some prepared comments, outlining our operating performance during the quarter. Tony Hooper, who as you know is our Head of Global Commercial Operations; and Sean Harper, our Head of R&D are also here with us to address any questions you might have for them. To further help with the understanding of product sales drivers, we have posted some slides on our website. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially. So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Bob Bradway : Thanks, Arvind. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today to discuss our strong third quarter results. As Arvind indicated, David Meline and I will offer some brief commentary in context of the quarter and then we will take some questions together with Tony and Sean. Again, just to reiterate, since we are meeting tomorrow morning for a comprehensive business review, we\u2019ll really try to keep the focus for this call on our quarterly results. Our third results just announced reflect strong sales performance across the portfolio, which when combined with our ongoing expense discipline generated 22% growth in operating income and 19% growth in earnings per share. Given the strategic emphasis we placed on growing our international presence, we were particularly pleased with the 14% growth in international sales during the quarter. Consistent with the strong underlying prescription trends that we\u2019ve seen through the first three quarters of the year, our product sales performance for the third quarter was up 4% year-over-year. And to recall, however, last year we recognized $155 million government order for NEUPOGEN that was reflected in our Q3 2013 results. Sales grew 8% year-over-year, excluding that one-time order from last year. Overall then, the Q3 performance was strong across the board and on a year-to-date basis revenues have increased 8%, with operating income increasing 24%, reflecting our improving margin structure. In a moment, David, will review the drivers of our key products and the financials in more detail, but as you know R&D is the engine that will drive future growth at Amgen and we continue to make good progress in advancing our registrational program, so I\u2019ll say a few words about those. We reported positive Phase 3 results from three innovative programs in the quarter, the second positive study for AMG 416, which is our intravenous calcimimetic, which performed well in the study versus placebo, Kyprolis Aspire study, which generated exceptional progression free survival data in the relapsed multiple myeloma setting, as well as evolocumab data in Japan, which is also an important opportunity for us. We submitted marketing authorizations for four programs in the quarter, with ivabradine in the U.S., evolocumab, blinatumomab and TVEC in the U.S. and EU, with both ivabradine and blinatumomab currently under priority review by the FDA. We also announced the first positive Phase 3 results for one of our biosimilar programs that being ABP 501 in psoriasis as we prepare to became launching our biosimilar portfolio beginning in 2017. We\u2019ll talk about strategy tomorrow and we look forward to providing more granularity on our progressing pipeline, our commercial plans for launching new products, our capital allocation plans, our business transformation initiative and progress, as well as an update on our biosimilar and manufacturing activities. Now, let me turn to David, who will walk you through the financials and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. David Meline : Okay. Thanks, Bob. I want to take a moment first briefly discuss the key drivers of product sales performance during the quarter. Enbrel units grew 3% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting strong underline demand, as this reflected in the prescription data. I would also like to point out that Enbrel continues to see strong segment growth in both rheumatology and dermatology at 21% and 24%, respectively. Recall last quarter that we called out $60 million of Enbrel inventory build in Q2 that we expected to burn-off in Q3, masking the strength in demand. Prolia's sales increased 43% in the quarter due to strong unit demand. As you\u2019re aware, we normally see some seasonality in Prolia in Q3 and we saw the expected sales ramp up as we exited the quarter. We continue to capture share in the growing market with XGEVA and despite generic competition over the past year, XGEVA sales increased 22%. Our newest products Kyprolis realized sequential sales growth of 21% to $94 million, much of which was driven by strong unit demand. We remained confident that Kyprolis will become the proteasome inhibitor of choice and you\u2019ll have the opportunity to hear from Pablo Cagnoni, who leads our Onyx business tomorrow. Finally, I would also like to highlight Vectibix, which grew 29% year-over-year on the strength of our new first line label in the U.S., as well as growth in the EU. Let me now make a few brief comments on our operating performances. Our operating expenses declined 5% due to Enbrel\u2019s improved profitability from the expired profit share agreement, as well as due to efforts to manage cost. This led to a 47% operating margin, a 7 point increase compared to the third quarter of 2013. Based on our progress through the first nine months of the year and our confidence in the underlines trends of the business, we\u2019re again raising our 2014 revenue guidance to $19.8 billion to $20 billion, and our 2014 adjusted EPS guidance to $8.45 to $8.55 per share. I would also like to provide a brief update on our transformation actions. At the time of our announcement in July, we estimated a headcount reduction of 12% to 15% of our global workforce or 2,400 and 2,900 staff. We have now completed and largely implemented the adjustment with the confirmed total in excess of 2,900 reductions. On the U.S. GAAP basis, restructuring charges totaled $376 million in the third quarter. We now expect the total cost of this action to be $835 million to $885 million through 2015, including an estimated $150 million charge in Q4 of 2014. We are also updating our guidance for the 2014 tax rate today. Based on uncertainty concerning the timing for the extension of the R&D tax credit within the 2014 calendar year, we\u2019ve chosen to remove the benefit from our projected 2014 adjusted tax rate, resulting in guidance of 16% to 17% for this year versus our previous guidance of 15% to 16%. We also saw in the quarter $1 billion increase in free cash flow to $2.6 billion reflecting the benefit of higher product sales and ongoing improvements in working capital. Our cash balance increased $1.6 billion over the previous year, now totaling $28.1 billion. Our debt balance of $33 billion is $5.8 billion higher versus Q3 of 2013 due to debt related to the Onyx acquisition. That completes our review of the quarter. I will now turn the call back to Arvind for Q&A. Arvind Sood : Excellent. Thank you, David. Marvin, let\u2019s go and open it up for Q&A and let\u2019s do that for about next 15 to 20 minutes if you want to start out by reviewing the procedure again for asking questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company: Thanks a lot for taking my question and congrats on our really strong performance in Q3. I guess the questions for David on the guidance. Even with the pumped up tax rate in 2014, if you hit your revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, it implies a pretty big decrease in operating margins. Just kind of wondering what might be behind that? David Meline : Yeah, Eric. So generally what we see in the fourth quarter is a pickup of the expenses. It\u2019s a seasonal trend that occurs until each year. And so what we\u2019re expecting is a similar pickup here in Q4. So I think nothing unusual but there's certainly some additional cost in Q4. Bob Bradway : Eric, as you know, we\u2019re gearing up for some potential launches next year, including launches that could take place early in the year. So that will be reflected as well when we get into the fourth quarter OpEx. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Matt Roden - UBS: Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions as well and congrats on the nice results. So you pointed out the expanding margin here in the second quarter and third quarter, certainly better than it\u2019s been in recent years. We understand that Enbrel profitability is part of that. But these numbers are also ahead future year estimates as a consensus estimates. So I just want to get a sense for with the caveat of an uptick of expenses in the 4Q and realizing, you can\u2019t really give guidance for 2015 at least today. Just wanted to get a sense for how sustainable you can keep this operating margin level and to what significant you think you grow from that new level? Thank you. Bob Bradway : Thanks for the question, Matt. It\u2019s Bob. That\u2019s and important question for us to address tomorrow and we look forward to addressing head on. As you point out, we benefited from an improve profitability at Enbrel but also from ongoing expenses supporting across the rest the business. I have a lot more say about that when we get together tomorrow. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison - Morgan Stanley : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask two-partner on Enbrel. So first, in the slides, you gave the price and inventory. Now if you look at inventory, you called out $16 million headwind as the case it looks like it was about higher slight about $110 million. So do you expect some inventory to reverse in the fourth quarter? And then the second is, you\u2019ve taken two 7% price increase this year yet you reassured about 1% year-over-year price pump. Is that because you gave most of the price back in terms of the contract and could you just talk a little bit about that too? Thanks. Bob Bradway : Sure. Matt, why don\u2019t we ask Tony to address those two questions. Right, Tony. Tony Hooper : Matt, the two questions, first one, you are correct, we actually entered the quarter accounting about $60 million. Inventory is fairly normal during the week but months and quarters tend to land in different places in that week which of course is shifting up and down. In addition to the $60 million we carried into the quarter that we had a burn-off, we actually closed the quarter at unusually low level of inventory with about $40 million reduced inventories. So that $100 million will directly flow into the fourth quarter. I think the price number that you\u2019d seen for the third quarter, there is a lot of ins and outs on those calculations. And I don\u2019t think you can take this as a true reflection as the net impacted price that we\u2019re applying in the market place. Marvin, let\u2019s take the next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Mohit Bansal - Deutsche Bank :  Great congratulations. This is Mohit Bansal for Robyn Karnauskas. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a good quarter. My question is regarding Enbrel. So given that the decent launch of TESLA in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, are you seeing any impact on Enbrel sales there in derm space. And then you talked about geographical mix bringing up the tax rate. So just wanted to get some sense of how should we think about it in the future? Thanks. Bob Bradway : Okay. I think you have two separate questions. I will ask David obviously to address the second, Tony if you want to tackle first. Tony Hooper :  Okay so -- talking about those launched into psoriasis in late September. So the actual data that we have available is fairly light at the moment. I would assume that the fourth quarter show a bit more robust data around prescriptions. Net, net in the third quarter, we don\u2019t see any reduction in the number of new naive patients going on to injectable biologics for psoriasis. And we also don\u2019t see any dramatic changes in the trend of our market share. David? David Meline :  Yeah. In terms of tax rates, so as I mentioned I think you understood why we took the rate up here in the quarter. And what\u2019s going to happen now is we\u2019ll look out and I think best address tomorrow I\u2019ve got a piece where I\u2019ll talk about how to think about taxes going forward and what are the key drivers of that. So, if you don\u2019t mind I m going to take it up with you in the morning. Mohit Bansal - Deutsche Bank :  Great. Thanks. David Meline : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Looking forward to (indiscernible) tomorrow. I had a question for Tony, on NEUPOGEN, would it be possible to in the U.S. for you to please give us the unit share that NEUPOGEN still enjoys of the short-acting TCS market. And I noticed on that slide, the impact of price on a year-on-year basis is not in the slide. What happened to price on the year-on-year basis? Thank you. Tony Hooper :  Mark, price on NEUPOGEN year-on-year is negligible that why it got actually listed and as regard to market share from a total Filgrastim portfolio, we still hold just over 98% of the market. Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group : And short acting? Tony Hooper : I\u2019ll have to get to that number, but the actual market share hasn\u2019t changed dramatically versus the third -- the second quarter. Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group : All right. See you tomorrow. Thank you. Tony Hooper : Okay. Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets : I had a follow-up question on NEUPOGEN as it relates to you last. I guess, as you are seeing some competitors impact, you noted that in your slides on the short-acting. How would that be different if at all for our Neulasta and what actually happens in terms of NEUPOGEN shares, is there are price issue, does that just continue some share. What exactly is going on there and how does relate to any risk from Neulasta in the future? Thanks. Bob Bradway : So I am not quite sure of the detail of your question but obviously we have seen Neulasta to continue the trend it had for last couple of quarters. We see little-to-no impact from the recently launched short-acting Granix. As you know, we do have a long-acting competitor in Europe and we\u2019ve seen a slow impact from them over the last year or so. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have a couple. First one is you guys had a decent quality sales for EPOGEN and so growth was primarily driven by price. So, I was wondering if you can talk about the pricing trend in that market and then do you expect any competition to come in 2015, U.S. or not? Then I have a second question for maybe Sean. Have you guys looked to add any post-talk analysis of cardiovascular events in the like heart trial? Bob Bradway : Okay. So let me then respond to your questions. As regard price, obviously we don\u2019t give any forward guidance on price. We did take a 4.9% price increase on EPOGEN in May this year and based on the contracts we have some of that flow through. As regards competition, as you know, MIRCERA have the right to enter the market effective July, 2014 and we do lose patent in May of 2015. Sean Harper : And regarding the analysis of the cardiovascular events in the Phase 3 studies, this analysis are performed in some of the longer-term exposure studies and those are actually published in the literature. There is a paper circulation where you see about half of the rate of cardiovascular events in the Evolocumab versus the placebo controller. I just cautioned interpretation around these various small numbers of events. It\u2019s extremely difficult to know whether these are play of chance or a real drug effect. I will just remind you that the numbers of events that are necessary generally to evaluate this thing is in the thousand of events versus double-digit numbers of events. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Yaron Werber - Citi: Great. Nice quarter and also thanks for taking my question. So, Sean, it\u2019s a question for you or I don\u2019t know if Tony wants to pick it up. Relating to Evolocumab, so your Phase 3 actually hit the endpoint using the EMA definition of statin intolerance. Regeneron\u2019s compound missed using the U.S. definition but at this point you guys haven\u2019t completed your Phase 3 using the FDA definition of statin intolerance. And so my question really has to do with, do you think that you can approve in the U.S. before that data is generated? Thank you. Sean Harper : I think, first of all, there has been discussion by companies in this space by European and the U.S. regulators. But I would not want you to think that there are clear guidances or definitions around this coming from the regulatory agencies. In fact, they are expressing to us the clear sense that they don\u2019t know exactly how to define this population, how to study it, what the study designs that would be necessary to actually get specific language around statin intolerance and is unclear whether such language is necessary. For example, one could define high-risk individuals who have not reached out the treatment goals despite the use of available therapy that would cover statin intolerant patients and non-statin intolerant patients. So it\u2019s a very difficult area. We actually are exploring a different ways of studying this problem so that we can eventually describe those data hopefully in our labeling. But it\u2019s not as clear set of guidelines from the regulators as they might appear on first blush. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Terrence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terrence Flynn - Goldman Sachs : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So we know Sanofi filed for approval of a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN this summer. Our team has done some work that suggests that additional patents beyond the composition of matter patent could be fairly significant impediments here in the U.S. to the first biosimilars, just given potential delays for litigation and appeals. So just remind, I just want to know if you can remind us if you guys have any additional patents beyond composition for NEUPOGEN and Neulasta and if we should place any weight on those patents to potentially delay biosimilar and trends? Thanks. Bob Bradway : I noticed a lot of discussion of that recently in the investment community. And again, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll talk about tomorrow. But I think, as you are aware, we and Sandoz are litigating one intellectual property issue now that relates to your question. And so we\u2019ll have an answer from the courts at some point on important piece of the question that you\u2019re asking. And generally, we expect that we will face competition for NEUPOGEN through time on the biosimilar pathway in the U.S. We also expect that we\u2019ll start to see some challenges for the long-acting Neulasta product as well in the U.S. probably at some point in 2016. Arvind Sood :  Marvin, before you move on to the next question, I just wanted to respond to Michael Yee\u2019s question about the market share or about the segment share for Neulasta. So on a sequential basis, we actually gained about a percentage point and also on a year-over-year basis, we gained about a percentage point in terms of unit share on Neulasta. Just take the next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies. Eun Yang - Jefferies: Thank you. Question on Kyprolis. So based on our discussions here with the physicians, Kyprolis has been used to off-label beyond Neulasta for multiple myeloma. So with the positively internal ASPIRE data, do you expect to see increases in sales in the next couple of quarters, or do you think medical community is waiting for over the survival data? Thank you. Tony Hooper : This is Tony. As you know the data is quite sparse, so what we do is we do about a thousand chart orders and then we do an extrapolation each quarter to determine the market shares. As I look at quarter three, we sold a distinctive increase in our market share in third line. We also saw an increase in our market share in fourth line plus. We have not seen a dramatic change in any second line uses of this particular stage. We will be presenting the data in ASH. The publication would be -- these ASH data will be public on about 6th of November and at that stage we\u2019ll see what happens. But we haven\u2019t seen any dramatic change in the marketplace to date now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Josh Schimmer - Piper Jaffray : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Hopefully, you can help, I guess, elucidate the extent of which in relevant territories your own internal projections have been able to accurately project biosimilar impact? And then how confident are you that your internal projections, whatever they maybe going forward for biosimilar erosion of your mature franchisees really do capture the likely effect? Bob Bradway : So let me try and respond. Obviously, there never been a historical situation in the U.S. that we can actually model anything on. The competition we have at the moment against NEUPOGEN is of course not a biosimilar competition. We have, however, in Europe looked over the last five, seven years, a large amount of biosimlar competition. And we have modeled Europe and it worked successfully to defend our business in Europe over the last five, seven years. So we\u2019ve done a combination of modeling Europe as a totality. We\u2019re taking countries inside Europe that as best as possible would potentially emulate practices of all behaviors in the U.S. And we use those models to create our long-range plans. Obviously, these are our best assumptions at present and only time will tell in terms of where the market will actually go. Tony Hooper :  I think as well, Josh, what I would add is if you look at a big picture, we have said that reliably, safety supplying biosimilars is not something that can be taken for granted. And if you look at the experience in Europe, you see several suppliers have struggled to fulfill the different tenders that they\u2019ve won through time. So the barriers to entry are the challenges of safely supplying the marketplace with biosimilars has proven the challenge and that\u2019s reflected in how we see marketplace competition evolving. I suspect that as we get into more biologics, patent and more complex modules, we will continue to see that being an issue. But generally now with the benefit of more than handful competitors, over more than a handful of years, and a number of markets in Europe the competition has been fairly predictable both from a pricing and share standpoint. Josh Schimmer - Piper Jaffray : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink. Howard Liang - Leerink: Thanks very much. So Neulasta, you had a very strong quarter but also managing the slight impact by competition. Does that mean that there is some inventory buildup? Can you talk about in general whether there is some meaningful or significant inventory changes quarter-over-quarter for all the products? David Meline : For Neulasta, there was a slight decline in inventory inside -- in the quarter. As you know, the Neulasta is clearly a line to a number of monosuppressant chemo regimen that takes place in the quarter. We have not seen a dramatic increase or decrease of those regimens that takes place, Howard, at the moment. So I don\u2019t think there is much inventory flow, maybe $20 million to $30 million that will flow into next quarter, but the usage has not been impacted by Granix and we continue to get long-acting usage in all the accounts we haven\u2019t mount. Bob Bradway : So Marvin what I am thinking of so we can get back to preparing for our business review and have a more full time discussion tomorrow. Why don\u2019t we just take two last questions? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein: Thanks very much. So let me jump in with question. I just want to follow up with Tony and perhaps with David. Tony could you break out price by U.S. and ex-U.S. You gave us the net which was very helpful, but just give us the trends there? And then David, could you just talk about currency effects during the quarter and what we should be expecting for the next couple of quarters presuming that things stay where they are? Thanks. Tony Hooper : Geoff, sorry is this price in total, price specific on the product. Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein: Just in aggregate for Europe versus -- or ex-U.S. versus the U.S. would be helpful? Tony Hooper : Okay. So we deal only with price decreases outside the United States, right. So there are continuous challenges around pricing in Europe and in Japan even though we don\u2019t have any visibility yet, but the price increases are predominately in the U.S. and not outside the U.S. Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein: Got it. Thank you. And then currency David? David Meline : Yes. On currency, first of all, as you would know, we have a fairly limited exposure right now as a company to currency movements given the profile of the business. Secondly, the company has a rolling hedge program so we have quite an extensive portfolio against any of the traded currencies where there is a forward market. I mean, as a consequence, you don\u2019t see any impact this quarter in our results due to foreign exchange movements, because they are offset by the hedge portfolio. And then if you look into next quarter, it\u2019s around $0.02 of a share negative, which is incorporated in the updated guidance. Geoffrey Porges - Bernstein: Terrific. Thanks very much. Operator :  Our last question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird. Chris Raymond - Robert Baird : Thanks a lot. Let me side in here. Just the question back on Kyprolis. So just noticing even you back out inventory and the other effects. The unit growth, it looks like you had really the strongest sequential growth since around the beginning of the launch. And I know ASPIRE which is top line, but just kind of what you ascribe that reacceleration do generally, if you can maybe give a little bit more color on that would be great? Bob Bradway : Let me spend a few minutes to say now the 'the growth' was about $16 million, $10 million of that is U.S. and $6 million in outside the U.S. As you know outside the U.S. we are getting some free approval sales in Europe and in Turkey. And we have the product approved in both Israel and Argentina. So $10 million growth in U.S. and $6 million outside the U.S. The $10 million in U.S. is about 13% growth, now that\u2019s say predominantly growing in third line and fourth line plus. Chris Raymond - Robert Baird : Thanks a lot. Bob Bradway : Thanks for that, Tony. I also want to thank all of you for your participation in our call this afternoon and look forward to seeing you tomorrow morning. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s Amgen third quarter earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Tom. Dr. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Susan, and thank you to everyone for joining us on our fourth quarter financial results conference call. Today, I will discuss our recent accomplishments and then turn to the important milestones in the pipeline that we expect to achieve in 2015. We made a great deal of progress in 2014, culminating December with the successful Phase II clinical results for CCX140, which is our lead inhibitor targeting the chemokine receptor known as CCR2 in diabetic nephropathy. I am also pleased to see that momentum carrying into 2015, exemplified by the recent initiation of a clinical study in pancreatic cancer with our second-generation CCR2 inhibitor CCX872. I have previously described our pipeline as comprising four key opportunity categories or four pillars of value. In our prepared remarks today, I will focus primarily on two of the four pillars of value, which we expect to drive much of the progress in our pipeline this year, specifically, our chemokine receptor CCR2 inhibitor program and our complement C5a receptor inhibitor program. Specifically, I will discuss the following three key topics. First, I will discuss our CCX140 Phase II diabetic nephropathy trial results and our plans to further advance that program in 2015 and beyond. Second, I'll describe our plans to expand our CCR2 program into oncology, including our initiative advancing our second-generation inhibitor CCX872 into pancreatic cancer. And third, I'll update you on our progress to advance our complement C5a receptor inhibitor program in ANCA-associated vasculitis and our efforts to further expand the program into other orphan indications, specifically, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. First, I'll start with our CCR2 program. Many lines of evidence suggest that the chemokine receptor known as CCR2 plays a crucial role in the progression of diabetic chronic kidney disease or diabetic nephropathy. We believe that inhibition of CCR2 may change the treatment paradigm for this disease. Today, the standard of care to treat diabetic nephropathy is essentially blood pressure medications. With that in mind, we believe that treatment with an orally available CCR2 inhibitor, CCX140 would provide a significant advancement in the treatment of this disease. Such advances could be both clinically and economically quite meaningful. Let me highlight for you recent positive Phase II clinical results with CCX140 in diabetic nephropathy and add some very recent information from ongoing prospective and pre-specified additional analyses of that trial. First, our clinical trial achieved the primary endpoint based on reduction of protein levels in the urine as measured by urinary albumin creatinine ratio or UACR. These results showed a statistically significant improvement in UACR from baseline in the patients who received orally dosed CCX140 at 5mg once a day continuously for a 52-week period in addition to a standard of care when compared to patients taking the standard of care alone. This was true across the all patients group in the trial. Second, also in the all patients category, we observed positive results across an important secondary endpoint, the estimated glomerular filtration rate or eGFR. This included most notably a 44% annualized improvement in eGFR over standard of care alone. This measurement in particular is key since eGFR as calculated by changes in serum creatinine will form the basis of the Phase III approval endpoint in this disease. Also it is important to note that CCX140 was safe and well-tolerated in the Phase II trial. We view these results as very promising, particularly if translated into preservation of renal function as measured by a meaningful delay in the time to dialysis or end-stage renal disease. Importantly, we very recently provided further analyses on pre-specified subpopulations in the study. Specifically those patients who are highly proteinuric having baseline albuminuria levels of 800 mg of albumin to gram of creatinine and above. This particular subpopulation represented approximately one-third of the patients in our Phase II study. These patients exhibited a 66% improvement in eGFR versus standard of care alone. If one were to use the standard extrapolation of eGFR slopes for this population of patients and estimate the time to dialysis, treatment with 5 milligram once daily of CCX140 could result in an estimated seven-year delay to dialysis, compared to standard of care alone. We believe this particular population, which includes over 1.7 million chronic kidney disease patients represents clinically and commercially meaningful population and also represents a potentially attractive population to evaluate in our Phase III program. The momentum in our CCR2 program continues with CCX872, our next-generation CCR2 inhibitor. Having several sites now activated, we are positioned to commence enrollment in a multicenter clinical trial of CCX872 in patients with non-resectable pancreatic cancer. The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CCX872 in combination with one of the standards of care FOLFIRINOX. Tumors subverts inflammatory and in fact, a factor of immune responses. In the tumor cell microenvironment, CCR2 bearing cells are thought to be largely of a suppressive behavior so-called myeloid-derived suppressor cells or MDSCs which effectively helped the tumor hide from the body\u2019s cytotoxic immune response to tumor cells. Inhibiting CCR2 and thereby the myeloid-derived suppressor cells controlled by CCR2 could then lead to liberation of the cytotoxic immune response against tumor cells and improved patient survival. We have evaluated CCX872 in several pre-clinical studies and have found that CCR2 inhibition results in significant reduction in tumor burden. Regarding the initial safety of CCX872, we have already completed extensive Phase I clinical development in healthy volunteers in which all tested dose levels, including those doses that we are using in the pancreatic cancer trial were well tolerated. At the ASCO GI meeting this past January, positive data from an investigator-led Phase Ib study of a Pfizer CCR2 inhibitor in pancreatic cancer were presented, providing additional validation for inhibiting CCR2 in the treatment of this disease. Our clinical study with CCX872 is just getting under way and we are encouraged by the clinical activity observed in the other study. We believe that in the next year, there will be additional discussion in the medical and scientific communities regarding CCR2 inhibition, in the treatment of pancreatic cancer and we look forward to CCX872 being part of that discussion. Our pancreatic cancer study is an open label, multicenter clinical trial designed to evaluate CCX872 plus FOLFIRINOX in up to 54 patients with non-resectable pancreatic cancer. The primary efficacy measurements will be progression-free survival when all patients have completed at least 24 weeks of treatment. We look forward to reporting initial data from this trial towards the end of the year. Now I will turn to our second pillar of value, our complement C5a receptor inhibitor program. CCX168 is our lead compound in this program. It is a very potent, orally available, highly specific, small molecule inhibitor of the complement C5a receptor or C5aR. The European CCX168 Phase II clinical trial, known as the CLEAR trial in patients with ANCA, associated vasculitis or AAV, made excellent progress in 2014. Buoyed by investigator enthusiasm, following the release of positive data from steps one and two of this trial, we have surpassed the halfway mark in terms of target enrollment numbers for step three of the study and we remain confident that we will complete enrollment in the CLEAR trial this year. AAV is a rare, severe, often fatal, autoimmune disease that is caused by autoantibodies called antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies, or A-N-C-A, ANCA. AAV is characterized by the inflammation that can affect many organs and areas of the body such as kidney, lung and your nose and throats. The annual incidence and prevalence of AAV in Europe and United States is estimated to be approximately 10 to 20 cases per million people per year and 150 to 200 cases per million people, respectively. Additionally, we have an ongoing North American Phase II CCX168 AAV trial, known as the CLASSIC trial. We've been actively initiating clinical sites and have commenced patient enrollment in that trial. CLASSIC will examine the safety and efficacy of two dose regimens of CCX168, when added to the full standard of care in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed AAV. I look forward to updating you on the progress of that trial as year progresses. Also on the CCX168 clinical front, we mentioned last quarter that we would be initiating a Phase IIa proof-of-concept study in patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, or aHUS in 2015. And that we plan to report early data from this study later this year. We remain on track to do so. The primary objective of this trial is to assess the effects of the C5a receptor inhibition therapy by once CCX168 on both in vitro and ex vivo thrombus formation, as well as disease activity in end-stage renal disease patients with aHUS. Our plans to further expand or complement C5a receptor program into other orphan diseases, such as IgA nephropathy are moving forward as well. And I will tell you more about those efforts next quarter. Finally during the fourth quarter, we also achieved some important regulatory milestones with CCX168. Specifically, the FDA granted Orphan-Drug Designation for CCX168 for the treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. And the European Commission granted orphan medicinal product designation for CCX168 for the treatment of microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, two forms of AAV.  Indeed, there is a great deal of momentum heading into 2015, with our complement C5a receptor program. And I look forward to updating you on relevant developments throughout the year. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Susan. Susan Kanaya : Thank you, Tom. As I mentioned earlier, our 2014 fourth quarter financial results were included in our press release provided earlier this afternoon. There was no revenue recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2014, compared to $0.7 million in the same period in 2013. The decrease in revenues from 2013 to 2014 is primarily due to funding of clinical support from former partner, GlaxoSmithKline for CCX168 in 2013. Research and development expenses were $9.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014, compared to $7.4 million for the comparable period in 2013. Higher expenses associated with CCX168 or C5aR inhibitor reflect the increased patient enrollment rate in the ongoing European CLEAR trial and expansion of Phase II clinical development for the same in North America. This increase was partially offset by lower expenses in our CCR2 program, primarily for CCX140, due to the completion of the Phase II clinical trial in patients with diabetic nephropathy. General and administrative expenses were $3.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014, compared to $3 million in 2013. This increase was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation for stock option grant and restricted stock unit awards. Total shares outstanding at December 31, 2014 were approximately 43.4 million shares. Cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $114.6 million at December 31, 2014 Before I turn the call back over to Tom, let me summarize our 2015 financial guidance. Our projected cash utilization for 2015 is expected to range from $45 million to $49 million. We therefore expect to end the year with cash and investments of approximately $70 million. With that, I will now turn the call back over to you, Tom. Dr. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Susan. We anticipate several milestones for both our CCR2 and C5a receptor program, which we expect to drive momentum in 2015. Starting with CCR2 program, we look forward to first presenting detail study results from the CCX140 Phase II trial in patients with diabetic nephropathy at upcoming medical meetings, second preparing for an end-of-Phase II meeting with regulatory agencies, and announcing initial data from our open label clinical trial from CCX872 and patients with non- resectable pancreatic cancer in the second half of 2015. In our complement C5a receptor program for CCX168, we look forward to first completing enrollment in the CCX168 Phase II CLEAR trial in Europe in patients with AAV, second continuing enrollment in the Phase II CLASSIC trial in North America in patients with AAV, and in the Phase IIa proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with IgA nephropathy, third presenting data supporting the anti-thrombogenic effect of CCX168 in serum from patients with aHUS in the second quarter of 2015v, and initiating a CCX168 Phase II proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome or aHUS. On the corporate development front, with our two lead programs yielding positive Phase II data, our alliance discussions continue to intensify and we look forward to advancing these partnering efforts in 2015. In closing, we have much to accomplish in 2015 and we remain intensely focused on the execution of all of our clinical opportunities and partnering initiatives. We will now take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Klein from Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brian Klein : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions and nice progress. Dr. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Brian. Brian Klein : First question is on CCX140. So you reported the data last year, it looked very good. Just wondering why the delay in meeting with the FDA in for the second half of this year. Is there any chance that you could expedite that meeting to the first half? And secondly, have you already started to think about a registrational program and maybe give us some insights there? Dr. Thomas Schall : Yes. Brian, all good questions. I would like to add to that I had the great pleasure today of being joined not just by Susan Kanaya but by Pirow Bekker, our Chief Medical Officer. So Pirow will also fill some of the questions as well. Let me a little bit of the stab at the first part of your question at least. So clearly, what we have is a trial with many hundreds of people, several important analyses that were pre-specified and prospective. We are still doing those analyses. As I mentioned, we have very recent information about the upper third pre-specified subpopulation with the high proteinuria where they showed quite a marked, even more marked improvement than the all patients population in the eGFR slopes. And so those are very important both for thinking about the total package of data that we need to put in a briefing document for the FDA, as well as the second part of what you are asking how to think about the Phase III clinical trial. So to the extent that we are moving as expeditiously as possible to getting our documentation together and putting it to the FDA and scheduling a meeting, as you may well imagine those, while it sounds straight forward, actually involve an enormous amount of data and we are in the process of getting that package together. We will get it to the FDA as expeditiously as we can. They, of course, need chance to review it and then get calendar it for the meeting, and obviously we will push forward with that. As I alluded to, one of the compelling features coming out of some of these pre-specified analysis is, are there populations that would be attractive in terms of both numbers of patients and time to the kinds of conversions of event that we need in a Phase III trial, Pirow will correct me on this if I am wrong, but we anticipate that the Phase III endpoint is essentially going to be an outcome driven study with the time to increase a 50% serum creatinine as the endpoint. Now serum creatinine, we convert by calculation to eGFR. So we use serum creatinine and eGFR kind of interchangeably. An increase of 50% serum creatinine is essentially about a 40% change in eGFR. And having these additional analyses it really allowed us to really focus on exactly what the Phase III might look like and what we might -- we will discuss with the regulatory agencies. I don\u2019t want to specify too many details beyond that at the moment on the Phase III trial design other than to say, we are very pleased that the Phase II data does directly inform in our opinion Phase III trial design. The Phase II data does read to what we believe is the endpoint in Phase III and that\u2019s been quite a luxury I think in the diabetic nephropathy space. Pirow, do you disagree with that or have something to answer at maybe? Pirow Bekker : No. I think, Tom, you\u2019ve answered it well. I think, Brian, we are beginning to really sort of hone the design of the Phase III trial that we will be discussing with the regulatory agencies. And as Tom has pointed out, we are seeing evidence that CCX140 is particularly effective in the patients with the high level of baseline albumin urea. It's also true that that patient population have a pretty steep decline in eGFR in -- that would actually be very meaningful in a Phase III study in the control group. So those aspects are all important in terms of design of the Phase III study and we\u2019re beginning to put together what that study might look like. Brian Klein : Great. Thank you. And then just two more quick questions, first, on CCX872, have you looked at combining that drug preclinically with other immuno-oncology or Checkpoint Inhibitors agent? And the second question is on CCX140, the data from the CLEAR trial, have you discussed with the European regulators about potentially utilizing that for an accelerated approval? Thank you. Dr. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Brian. We have ongoing work right now on the combination approach of CCR2 inhibition with other emerging therapies such as Checkpoint Inhibitors, yes, we do. We\u2019ll be talking about some more of that work a little later on in this year. So we don\u2019t have any details to give you right now. It\u2019s very relevant, however, because even with the Checkpoint Inhibitors emerging is certainly very significant therapies. There is some limitations in dose, as you know and others will perceive for Checkpoint Inhibitors. So still a lot of benefit to be gained by looking at combinations and we're very optimistic about some of that work and the data we will be able to present a little later on. And the other question about CCX168. So, Pirow, perhaps, you want to say something about that. Pirow Bekker : Brian, I think, the steps 3 of the CLEAR trial is going to provide us with a complete data set for this Phase II study, which I think will provide us with sufficient number of patients and a robust data say to approach agencies with regard to potential accelerated approval. So that's what I think our plan is at this point. Brian Klein : Great. Thank you for taking my question. Dr. Thomas Schall : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Anupam Rama from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Anupam Rama : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on Brain\u2019s question on 872. Just with initial data expected in 2015, can you talk about sort of the benchmark for the trial from an efficacy perspective? So just kind of move that program forward, I know you\u2019re doing some combination work in the background but just maybe in reference to the Pfizer trial that readout because to you, I think they only showed a partial response and stable disease response data. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done PFS data from them. And then just a quick one on CCX140, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s the plan is still to go into an end of Phase II meeting with the partner? Dr. Thomas Schall : Let me handle the last question first and I'll turn the first question over to Pirow. Thank you, Anupam. So, we certainly are moving forward as expeditiously, as we can to develop the clinical program for Phase III. As you know, our financial model does not entirely predict having Phase III development be done on all of our sole investments. So, we are actively looking at partnership opportunities for 140. I think there would be some preference if I'm also a potential partner to be involved in the end of Phase II discussions. However, I would not consider that a necessarily an absolute gaining item for us to go on, as we build out our clinical development plan. Anupam Rama : Got it. Pirow Bekker : With regard to your first question, you\u2019re absolutely correct, Anupam. So with the Pfizer study, they only had a 12-week treatment period and so they showed a partial response rate of about 50%. I think the number was 48% at the 12-week time point, compared to the historical control of 28%, so three substantial improvement in the partial response rate. Unfortunately, they did not dose beyond 12-week, so they could not comment or provide data on progression-free survival. Our intent is to dose beyond 12 weeks, so that we could actually generate some data on progression-free survival and overall survival. And for that, the historical data is about 50% progression-free survival, right with fulfilling us only. So, I think we will be looking obviously for an improvement in that right. Our study depending on whether you have the full complete dataset or not, we will be looking at about a 60% plus progression-free survival rate to be clinically meaningful. Anupam Rama : Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Dr. Thomas Schall : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Yaron Werber from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. This is [Kenon] [ph] on for Yaron. Congratulations on the quarter and finishing up. Just a couple of questions. So if I\u2019m just doing some sort of back the envelope calculations on eGFR, if third of the patients with the high albumin had 66% of eGFR, based on the 44% overall, is the other two-thirds of the population around 33% eGFR improvement? And then based on that, would you be looking at going into patients with high albumin for your Phase III? Dr. Thomas Schall : Very good question. So what we really -- one of the reasons we did the pre-specified analyses is to look at the population that might be most amenable as a Phase III population among other things. So, I'll stress that the all-patients population, which ranges from 100 milligrams of albumin to a gram of creatinine in UACR up to 3,000. So it\u2019s a fairly broad stretch, showed us a 44% improvement in eGFR. So the question is relevant, if you divide that into tertiles and the upper tertile of 800 mgs per gram of creatinine and above gives you 66% improvement then arithmetically some of the other cells was probably somewhat lower and you are quite correct. So what we see is the higher the albuminuria, the more profound the slope change in eGFR. And that's relevant obviously as we think about doing a Phase III trial. You could, in fact, based on the fact that the efficacy shifts seems to be quite pronounced in eGFR. And by the way for historical reference, drugs have been approved in the space mostly ACEs and ARBs. Losartan comes to mind because it has the most extensive data published from clinical trial. Losartan only gave us 16% eGFR slope change annualized benefit over the background medication at the time it was tested in Phase III. So we are really outstripping some of the historical magnitudes of benefit that one sees for approved agents in diabetic nephropathy. It\u2019s interesting to scale in that way to think about those references. So when we think about the fact that we could in fact design a Phase III clinical trial that covers all the patients that we had in our original phase II trial design and that would take a certain number of patients over a certain number of months, and those numbers are certainly rather larger than if we just focused on the upper tertile of proteinuria, which is the 800 mgs per gram and above as I mentioned. There we could probably reduce considerably and the time to our Phase III endpoints is also reduced considerably. And so that makes it more accessible Phase III trial design, more affordable and shorter. So that's really one other things we are focused on in Phase III. Now, I will say even if you had a label, which was very restrictive, one will not think of that as necessarily problematic because as I mentioned in the remarks about 1.7 million people felt even that fairly restricted proteinuria description. I could give you another comparator, there are two other Phase III programs that people ask about from time to time, one is Atrasentan and AbbVie program in Phase III. If we look at their inclusion criteria in Phase III, it's about 1.8 million people described by proteinuria and filtration. And then also, pyridorin, NephroGenex\u2019s compound in Phase III is about 0.9 million target population based on their inclusion parameters. So I would say that we are right -- predicted or at least one of the considered Phase III designs is as big a target population or bigger than the other [Axon] [ph] Phase III programs. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. That is super helpful. And then actually just one other sort of housekeeping question, during your financial guidance for 2015, is that including beginning a Phase III trial? And is that assuming sort of a partnership just trying to figure out how to accurately model it? Dr. Thomas Schall : Right. So Susan, I\u2019m saying, go ahead. Susan Kanaya : Sure. Thank you. So this is just a baseline cash utilization projection, does not assume any partnership activity and not initiating a Phase II, III study at this time. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. Thank you so much and congrats again. Dr. Thomas Schall : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Yatin Suneja from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Yatin Suneja : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I just have a -- I just have a quick question on the proof-of-concept trial that you are planning to initiate in aHUS. Could you maybe give us more idea in terms of what patient population are you going to enroll? Are you going to enroll? Are you going to enroll some of these naive patients, some of these treated patients where you would be conducting this trial U.S., ex-U.S.? And then I think I missed the endpoint that you talked about earlier, so if you can just repeat that, that would be great? Thank you. Dr. Thomas Schall : Certainly, Yatin. Thank you. I\u2019ll let Pirow handle most of this question, but I\u2019ll just give you some quick background. We have tested the sera of diagnosed aHUS patients in ex vivo assays where we run that sera over activated microvascular endothelial cells mimicking what happens we think in the real world and vessels including the kidney -- I'm sorry blood vessels of the kidney and other organs, but predominantly kidney. And what happens in that reaction is you get huge thrombus formation in the presence of that sera from the patients. Whereas if you run a normal person sera in the same assay you don't get thrombus occurring in that reaction. When we incubate that reaction with our drug, CCX168 we can inhibit the formation of the thrombus. We also see the inhibition of that formation of thrombus with eculizumab, Soliris. So the effects seem to be quite comparable at least as we take the patient sera out of the body and incubate with these therapeutically relevant agents, one of which is approved. So that's the background of what we are doing. In terms of how we are going in our dose to patients directly and what they look like, I\u2019ll let Pirow take that part of the question. Pirow Bekker : Thanks, Tom. So again, this is a proof-of-concept study. We will be dosing our effective dose that we\u2019ve shown in the ANCA-associated vasculitis study in Europe, the CLEAR study. So this is a 50-milligram twice daily. The dosing period is 15 days. We are planning to enroll up to approximately 10 patients in the study. And we want to, first of all, look at safety tolerability of the compound. These patients are patients with diagnosed aHUS who are on dialysis. And we will be looking at from an efficacy point of view, we will take the blood from these patients and evaluate that in the thrombus assay, as well as Thomas pointed out we\u2019ve conducted some in vitro studies already with that. And we will also be looking at clinical outcome parameters, platelet counts, hemoglobin, LDH, C5a levels, C5b at complex levels and so on in these patients. Yatin Suneja : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Tom Schall. Dr. Thomas Schall : Thank you very much. I really appreciate everyone's participation today and their questions. I look forward to talking more about our progress next quarter and wish everyone a great afternoon. Thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the last speakers\u2019 prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself through asking one question during the Q&A session [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may begin. Arvind Sood : Okay, Brian, thank you. Good afternoon everybody. I would like to welcome you to our conference call to review our operating performance for the first quarter. After you\u2019ve had a chance to assess our performance I think you\u2019ll concur you\u2019ll agree that we are off to a great start. To further discuss our performance today our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bob Bradway, will lead the call. Bob will provide a brief overview of our strategic and operational progress followed by our CFO David Meline, who will review our Q1 results. Following David, our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, who will discuss our product performance during the quarter, followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a brief update on our pipeline. We will give slides for presentation today, these slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by email. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says, that through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially. So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay, thank you, Arvind. Good afternoon everyone, thank you for joining our call. As you can see from our results we\u2019re off to a solid start so far in 2015. And our performance during the quarter is a good indication that we\u2019re on track to deliver our long-term objectives as well. Financially, we delivered strong quarter really across the board. Our U.S. business delivered 15% growth and internationally we were up 10% at constant currency. Product performance was solid across the portfolio and I was especially pleased with the strong growth we delivered for Prolia, XGEVA, Kyprolis, Enbrel and Vectibix. Heading into the balance of the year, we have good momentum in our base business and Tony will have more to say about that in a few minutes. Our earnings growth of 33% reflects the benefits of our transformation initiatives and our discipline in controlling expenses ahead of the launch investments that we\u2019ll make later this year. As David will share based on the strong performance in the quarter we\u2019re raising our 2015 earnings guidance. With the Corlanor approval last week we\u2019re excited to bring the first new heart failure medicine to the market in the U.S. in almost a decade. Corlanor was approved to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure, which is you know is a significant economic burden on our society. Through Corlanor, we look forward to establishing our presence in cardiovascular field as we prepare to launch Repatha later this year. In addition to Corlanor, we are launching BLINCYTO for patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia and our Neulasta on-body injector which addresses a real clinical problem with an innovative solution that enables the administration of Neulasta the day after chemotherapy. R&D as you know is a core focus at Amgen and our pipeline continues to deliver results that position us well for future growth. We reported the third successful Phase 3 study for AMG 416, an intravenous calcimimetic for use in kidney disease. And a second successful Phase 3 study for our lead biosimilar product adalimumab. In oncology Kyprolis delivered impressive results showing a doubling of progression free survival versus bortezomib in relapsed multiple myeloma patients in our ENDEAVOR study and of course these data come on the back of the unprecedented progression free survival data that were generated in our ASPIRE trial. Kyprolis is currently under accelerated review in both the U.S. and Europe for multiple myeloma patients who relapsed and we are excited with the opportunity to bring this important medicine to many more patients globally. Sean, will speak more about progress in our pipeline in a few moments. In summary, there is lot to be pleased about with our progress so far this year. Our strategy is working and it\u2019s delivering results. We are executing effectively across the company, controlling the things that are ours to control. Our focus and priorities have never been more clear. Our launches are proceeding well and we are ready to launch Repatha later this year. We continue to grow key products including Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Sensipar and Nplate. We have strong momentum as we defend our base business against new competition and our transformation efforts are delivering efficiencies in cost savings across the company and we are being very disciplined about capturing them. Finally, we continue to advance our robust pipeline of important medicines setting the stage for long-term growth. Before I hand over to David, I would like to thank my Amgen colleagues many of whom are listening to this call for their unwavering commitment to delivering for patients and for shareholders. David? David Meline : Okay, thanks, Bob. Turning to the first quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenues at $5 billion grew 11% year-over-year with 12% product sales growth driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Total revenue in product sales were impacted 2% unfavorably due to foreign exchange headwinds. Adjusted operating income at $2.4 billion grew 32% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved to 50% for the quarter, reflecting strong growth and continued progress from our transformation initiative. On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.1% improved by 0.6 points driven by lower royalties and higher average net sales price offset partially by product mix. Research and development expenses at approximately $850 million, were down 14% versus the prior year. R&D spend was favorably impacted by the transformation and process improvements across the area. SG&A expenses were flat on a year-on-year basis, as increased commercial investments in new product launches were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. Total operating expenses declined 3% year-on-year and 22% sequentially. This performance reflects the combination of the first quarter being typically the lowest expense level during the calendar year, plus a share of the $400 million of incremental savings expected during 2015 from our transformation initiative. Going forward, we expect quarterly expenses to increase in line to modestly above historical trends, reflecting increasing launch and R&D investments through the balance of 2015. Other income and expenses improved 9% on a year-over-year basis at a $146 million in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate was 17% for the quarter, a 1.6 point increase versus Q1 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings, partially offset by a state audit settlement in the quarter. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 33% on a year-over-year basis. Turning next to cash flow in the balance sheet on Page 6. For the first quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow, an increase of $0.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by a higher sales and profitability. Total debt outstanding ended Q1 at $30.3 billion and cash and investments totaled $27.1 billion. Additionally our first quarter 2015 dividend increased to $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior period. Finally in the first quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity with over $450 million of share repurchases or approximately 3 million shares in the period. We intend to continue repurchases at a stepped up level in 2015 consistent with the commitment to complete up to 2 billion of repurchases by the end of the year. Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on Page 7, we remain on track with our plans to continue supporting growth of the business, while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue we are raising the bottom-end of the range resulting in a revised guidance of $20.9 billion to $21.3 billion for 2015. This reflects solid revenue performance in the first quarter partially offset by the effects of foreign currency headwinds, which will exceed $200 million for 2015 at current rates versus our original planning framework, versus 2014 results we expect over a $300 million revenue impact or 2% in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates. Our revenue guidance also reflects progress on our product launch activities as well as our latest view of evolving competitive dynamics. We are also increasing our 2015 earnings per share outlook to $9.35 to $9.65 from the previous $9.05 to $9.40 forecast. The increased earnings outlook reflects continued conviction in our strategy and strong first quarter performance along with an incremental expected headwind of $0.05 per share from foreign exchange, versus 2014 results we expect to $0.12 EPS impact in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates. We would also expect our quarterly tax rate to increase throughout the balance of the year to be more in line with our guidance range of 18% to 19%, which has a remainder, excludes the benefit of the Federal R&D tax credit in 2015. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $800 million this year. This concludes the financial update I will now turn the call over to Tony. Tony Hooper : Thank you, David. And good afternoon folks, you\u2019ll find the summary of our global sales performance for the first quarter on Slide number 9. I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019re off to a strong start in our first quarter of 2015. We select some execution across all aspects of our commercial strategy, launching products, growing on newer products and defending our mature in line brands. Globally product sales grew 12% year-over-year. As Bob mentioned, our U.S. business delivered outstanding results of 15% year-over-year growth and our international business grew 10% year-over-year excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange. Let me first update you on our new product launches. In the U.S. our recent launches of BLINCYTO acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the on-body injector for Neulasta are going very well with positive feedback from healthcare providers. BLINCYTO as you know was approved in two and a half months by the FDA underscoring the unmet medical need in ALL patients. We are seeing a broad acceptance of the product with orders from most major institutions and good reimbursement access. We launch the on-body injector for Neulasta during quarter one. Patients no longer have to return to the hospital 24 hours later after their chemo, the on-body injector simply infuses Neulasta return. We\u2019re still on the early stages of our launch we\u2019ve seen good breadth prescribing was about 800 accounts ordering product to-date. At last Wednesday we received the approval for Corlanor to reduce the risk of hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure. Corlanor is the first new medicine for chronic heart failure in the U.S. in almost a decade. Heart failure is a common condition that affects maybe six million people with annual cost of over $30 billion in the U.S. the majority of these costs are related to hospitalizations. And we at Amgen estimate there is as many as one million patients could be candidates for Corlanor therapy. Since our approval last week, our manufacturing team will work to the weekend, printing labels, packaging product and made our first shipment to wholesalers yesterday. Product will be in pharmacies later this week and our sales force was trained and in the field. We\u2019re excited about the opportunity and ready to bring this innovative new medicine to cardiologist and patients. Let me now turn to the first quarter performance beginning with Enbrel. On Slide 12, you see that Enbrel delivered strong growth of 13% year-over-year primarily driven by price. Segment growth remains strong in both rheumatology and dermatology growing 23% and 30% respectively. Competition continues to intensify particularly in dermatology, where Enbrel has lost 5 points of value share over the last year, but still retains 27% share. And will, continues to be a logical choice of patients starting treatment with the biologic. On Slide 13, you will see the sequentially Enbrel sales declined 17%. Unit declined 7% reflecting normal quarter one season patterns and price growth of 9% and there was 17% unfavorable impact in the inventory. You may recall from our conference call in January that wholesale inventories ended 2014 at a higher than normal level by about $40 million. And we expect the level to return to normal in quarter one. However in the first quarter the days on hand dropped to the low end of the range. Additionally revised prescription data will but there was modest end customer buying in the fourth quarter, which then burnt off in quarter one. To summarize, in quarter one below than normal wholesale inventory level coupled with the end customer burn-off negatively impacted sales. We expect Enbrel to deliver significant growth in 2015 and as we said before we remain committed to Enbrel becoming a $5 billion brand. I\u2019ll move now to Prolia. Prolia is delivered 39% growth year-over-year with 30% unit growth in the U.S. and 44% in the international. Over the last year Prolia market share grew three percentage points in the U.S. and about four percentage points in Europe. This performance is driven by our programs simply to access improved inherence, along with directed consumer marketing in the U.S. Prolia is now capturing one in three patients, starting postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment in the United States. As you can see from the March prescription data the expected Q2 pickup is underway. XGEVA continued the solid performance with the 22% growth year-over-year. U.S. unit share increased four percentage points over last year and in Europe unit share increased about seven percentage points. Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA\u2019s superior clinical profile versus the competition. Overtime, Vectibix has received expanded indications into earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer in both the U.S. and Europe. This delivered 18% year-over-year growth with exceptionally strong unit demand. We\u2019ve also recently received additional pipeline indication in combination with our theory in Europe. Let me now turn to Kyprolis, which delivered year-on-year growth of 59% and quarter-over-quarter growth of 19%. In the U.S. we received priority review for label expansion into second line, based on these biodata, for the late July PDUFA date. We have submitted the application in Europe and it is currently under review. These data together with our compelling ENDEAVOR data should position Kyprolis, as the best-in-class proteasome inhibitor. Sensipar grew 24% year-over-year driven by 14% unit growth, price and inventory levels compared to quarter one in 2014. Nplate grew 12% year-over-year with strong unit growth in all regions across the world. Now turn to our mature brands starting with the progressing franchise. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 4% in the first quarter driven mainly by price and inventory changes. As I mentioned earlier, we launched the on-body Neulasta injector during the quarter with very positive feedback from both providers and payers. NEUPOGEN declined 15% year-over-year mainly due to banded short-acting competition in the U.S. With strong execution value of NEUPOGEN team resulted in relative stable quote-unquote sequential market share in the short-acting market around 80%. Granix was about 15% and Leukine about 5%. Look at things are compete account by account and reinforced NEUPOGEN\u2019s long track record clinical, efficacy and safety, as well as you ability to liable supply patients. With potential competition from biosimilars expected in the U.S. this year, we will leverage the success we\u2019ve had in the U.S. versus brand of competition, as well as our considerable experience with NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe. Next at the EPOGENs which have an unusual 16% year-over-year growth in the quarter, on top of price gain of 7%, EPOGENs year-over-year growth benefits from a favorable compared to quarter one 2014, where end customers drill down inventory levels significantly. In addition, quarter one 2015 benefit from favorable accounting and discount adjustments as well as higher end customer inventories due to an SKU conversion. From underlying business perspectives, dosing and hemoglobin that was remind relatively stable and the unit demand is relatively flat. Aranesp sales grew 4% year-over-year with a unit growth of 6%. A portion of this growth reflects the timing of early tender orders in the Middle East versus 2014. So in conclusion, I\u2019d like to say, I\u2019d to personally thank our Amgen customer facing teams across the world. This is a unique moment in our company\u2019s history where we are some things we launching, growing and defending more brands than ever before. I know our team is embracing the Amgen value of competing intensely to one and have a clear focus on delivering value for shareholders, Amgen and most importantly for patients. Let me now pass it to Sean. Sean Harper : Thanks Tony. Good afternoon. Well, continues to be a very busy timeframes in R&D, and today I would like to start with our cardiovascular program, specifically the recent U.S. approval Corlanor or ivabradine for chronic symptomatic systolic heart failure. Chronic heart failure is in arise in the United States and represents a very large and growing healthcare expenditure burden primarily due to the cost of repeated hospitalizations in these very gradual patients. In fact, reducing hospitalizations in these patients as a specific focus in many healthcare systems including medicare a resting heart rates is seven or more appears to be a maladaptive response in the setting of chronically reduced cardiac pump function. Yes, despite the availability of specific beta blockers, many heart failure patients in the United States maintain such an elevated heart rate at rest. For these patients Corlanor\u2019s unique mechanism of action, they potentially benefit them, with respect to reducing the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure. In the large outcome study performed by our colleagues at [indiscernible] that risk was reduced by 26% compared to placebo on top of standard of care including beta blocker. Obviously, reduction in hospitalizations reflects patients doing better overall, in terms of their heart failure management. We\u2019re not only thrilled with the prospect of making Corlanor available to chronic heart failure patients in the U.S., but we also view this is an excellent way to introduce ourselves to the company to the U.S. cardiology community, as we prepared for the launch of our PCSK9 inhibitor Repatha. Of course Repatha continues to be a main focus for U.S. And, we\u2019re very pleased to see the enthusiasm for this agent, at the recent American College of Cardiology meetings. In response with the data we presented there and publish to the New England Journal of Medicine. It\u2019s quite remarkable to see so much depth of understanding and appreciation of the potential benefit risk profile of a novel mechanism by cardiologist and lipid specialists. We were also pleased to a file Repatha in Japan with our partners Astellas. The last thing I\u2019d like to mention our cardiovascular portfolio is omecamtiv mecarbil or AMG 423. The novel mechanism agent we are advancing in systolic heart failure with Cytokinetics. We look forward to seeing the data in the second half of this year, from our Phase 2 chronic oral study, which is now completed enrollment. Turning to oncology, we were pleased to receive priority review from FDA on our Kyprolis sNDA, for relapsed multiple myeloma, based on these biodata. And we look forward to continued interactions with regulators to bring Kyprolis the patients in need. Also in the relapse setting we were quite encouraged by the ENDEAVOR data demonstrating a doubling of progression free survival in patients randomize to Kyprolis as compared to Velcade. We look forward to providing the details of these results at ASCO in the multiple myeloma oral section on Tuesday morning. We\u2019re also initiative a Phase 3 study of a weekly dosing regimen for Kyprolis, which we feel will be quite important for patients and caregivers. I\u2019d also note that during the first quarter Vectibix was approved in the EU for first line metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with FOLFIRI and was also granted full approval in the EU. Turning to T-VEC, we completed the Phase 1b portion of the T-VEC combination study. We\u2019re performing in metastatic melanoma in collaboration with Merck and their PD-1 antibody KEYTRUDA. And we expect to advance next into the Phase 3 portion of this exciting study. We\u2019re in the final planning stages of a similar Phase 1b 3 study in head and neck cancer with Merck and KEYTRUDA as well. Clearly, the vast majority of the potential value of T-VEC lies in priming immune system in combination with Type 1 inhibitors and other mechanisms that modulates the immune system\u2019s discrimination between cells and non-cells. We continue to explore such opportunities both within our own pipeline as well as in collaboration with others. In the meantime, despite the very rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape since the design of the T-VEC monotherapy study in melanoma including the approval of multiple agents with proven all \u2013 overall survival. We continue to believe that it is important to make T-VEC monotherapy available to the patients segments in which meaningful rates of durable response were observed in Phase 3. We therefore look forward to our discussions on this topic at the FDA Advisory Committee meeting scheduled for April 29. Finally, we have decided to self-administration of [indiscernible] investigational product in the Phase 3 study of trebananib in first line ovarian cancer, based on recommendation by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee, who deemed the study unlikely to achieve its primarily PFS end point. In the inflammation space, our Phase 3 psoriasis data from Brodalumab or IL-17 receptor antagonist was very well relieved at the recent American Academy of Dermatology Meeting as we discussed in detail at our Investor Relation event. For those of you who are not able to participate in addition to the very compelling efficacy data including superiority over or Stelara or ustekinumab along with an overall balanced safety profile, we did note that we\u2019ve seen suicidal ideation and behavior in our Brodalumab program in these patients known to be at risk for these events. However, we believe the evidence today does not suggest the cause of relationship between IL-17 inhibition and suicidal ideation and behavior. Data have been provided to regulatory authorities and we will be discussing it with them on an ongoing basics. This topic will be an important and appropriate focus of regulators in their analysis of the risk benefit profile during their review of the application as we planned to file for Brodalumab. Along with our partner at AstraZeneca, we do anticipate submitting this agent globally mid year. We also recently decided to stop the Phase 2 asthma study with Brodalumab based on futility at a planned interim analysis. In other areas, our Phase 3 head-to-head study of AMG 416 versus Sensipar in hemodialysis patients\u2019 secondary hyperparathyroidism was positive and we anticipate initiating global regulatory submissions in the second half of this year. Our biosimilar programs also continue to advance with positive Phase 3 data for our Humira biosimilar in rheumatoid arthritis. We view our migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody AMG 334 as a top priority. And we will strive to be both first and best-in-class in this field. We expect to present data from our Phase 2b episodic migraine study at the International Headache Society Congress next month and to initiate Phase 3 later this year. Finally, I\u2019d like to thank the R&D team at Amgen for their continued focus on innovation and execution of our key programs. In particular recently it was very nice to see the level of acknowledgment paid to the remarkable breakthroughs in human genetics by deCODE in Iceland celebrated in the both scientific and lay press. There was certainly be much more to come in this very exciting era of biology. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay, thanks Sean. Before we move to Q&A, let me just repeat that we\u2019re focused on executing against the strategy for long-term growth that we laid out during our business review meeting last October. We\u2019re successfully executing on our new product launches. We\u2019re now continuing to grow key products such as Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Sensipar and Nplate. Of course, we continue to advance our robust pipeline as you\u2019ve just heard from Sean and our transformation efforts are delivering efficiencies in cost savings, which we\u2019ll capturing across the company. This quarter\u2019s results proved to us that we\u2019re delivering progress against our long-term objectives. And with that, we would like to take your questions. Bryan, do you to remind our callers of the procedures for the Q&A. Operator : Sure. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Bernstein. Geoffrey Porges : I will try and be brief. There have been some questions about a partnership to support the launch of Repatha. And it seems as though it\u2019s also fairly [indiscernible] but is that something that you can now help us to rule out definitively given that that you have a pretty short interval until the launch? Thanks. Bob Bradway : Geoff, we\u2019re excited about launching Repatha and we\u2019re well along as you say in our plans for launching the molecule and we own the rights to this product globally and we look forward to commercializing it globally. Of course, we\u2019re sharing \u2013 you know we had a partnership in Japan with Astellas but otherwise the rights are ours. Geoffrey Porges : Terrific. Well, I\u2019ll take that as a no, thanks. Bob Bradway : Okay. Brian, let\u2019s take the next question. Operator : Yes, our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets. Michael Yee : Thanks. You hit on the Neulasta on-body device briefly, but maybe if you could give some color as to the launch, how fast you think you can convert and whether or not there is anything else that we should be thinking about as to why that would be different than the NEUPOGEN competition like we saw there and now we can get comfortable with [indiscernible] competition to Neulasta. Tony Hooper : Michael, it\u2019s Tony. So let me do some response. Obviously, it\u2019s pretty early in the launch period itself, but we\u2019ve seen pretty good uptick across as I said the 800 institution, the early debate was around reimbursement and access. We\u2019re blocking that down and the product starts to move quite fast. We are exceeding our own internal expectations at this particular stage and we continue to see very good feedback from patients who really see this as a distinctive and definitive advantage. Nurses are also very keen to utilize the product and to help patients as they go home. And last but not least more and more institutions are stepping in to buy products. So we continue to see an ongoing conversion of the business to the on-body injector. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Robert W Baird. Chris Raymond : Question on Repatha. So, I know you probably don\u2019t want to go too much into the patent infringement case against Sanofi and Regeneron, but \u2013 so just noticing that the proposed scheduling order is out there and it has \u2013 and some of the key events \u2013 the Markman hearing for example and jury trial slated for after launch of both of these drugs. And I know you have talked about in the past in fact you have a press release I think from last year you know highlighting a potential PI, preliminary injunction. Is that still on the table or how should we think about that given the scheduling order here that \u2013 that\u2019s out there? Thanks. Bob Bradway : Thanks for your question, Chris. We\u2019re focused on having this matter reviewed on the merits. And as you pointed out, we\u2019re fortunate that it looks like we\u2019re going to be able to do that early in the New Year. So, we\u2019ll look forward to \u2013 again this is being reviewed in its entirety. And as you know and as we\u2019ve said before, we feel we have a very strong intellectual property patent estate on this product and we demonstrated in the past our determination to assert our IP rights and defend them and that\u2019s what we look forward to doing for this product early next year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Mark Schoenebaum : Hi, guys thank for taking my question. First, congrats on all of the progress in last six months, 12 months on margins and on Kyprolis. So congrats on that. My question is actually on margins in the quarter. David you talked about how you printed a 50% operating margin, which is dangerously close to the 20 \u2013 lower end of the 2018 margin guidance you gave and it sounds like you expect that margin to deteriorate throughout this year. I was wondering if you can talk through some of those dynamics as the year goes on. I think your guidance implies a full year operating margin of may be 44% or 45%, maybe talk about why your guidance implies deterioration throughout the year. And I recognize this is deterioration from a surprisingly great number this quarter? Thanks. David Meline : Yes, so first of all in Q1 as we said we are really encouraged by the performance in the business which was obviously a combination of solid top line growth, as well as the fact that we had very good expense management in the quarter. If you frame that as to how that evolves through the year then what I would say is a couple of things, one is we\u2019d indicated previously that we expect this year our transformation to deliver about $400 million of incremental savings. And certainly we saw a share of proportionate share of that already land here in Q1. And those savings will continue pretty steadily through the year. The second dynamic on cost then is around the cost trends in particular if I look at SG&A and the sales and marketing area, as well as R&D, we do expect to see raising costs which is a combination of the fact that we inevitably, normally for the business of the first quarter is the low point for expenses overall for the year, but I think importantly for us right now we do have these launches that are coming up we do expect to underwrite those launches significantly with this transformation savings and we do expect the trend of spending to increase through the year. So I think you basically framed it correctly as to how we are thinking about this evolving in the year. Bob Bradway : And Mark, not to miss the opportunity to talk about the long-term as I said and as David said in his remarks, we feel we are clearly making progress towards our long-term objectives including net margin objective. Arvind Sood : Brian, let\u2019s take the next question. Operator : Yes and our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Great thanks for taking the question. I want ask one of ivabradine. You guys have highlighted potentially a million patients do you think could potentially be candidates for ivabradine therapy that\u2019s a pretty big market number when you look at how you price that it about 4,500 on an annual basis and well below where forecast are. Can you may be help us think about either why consensus is too low on ivabradine or why not all of that patient population you highlight is actually accessible? Thanks. Tony Hooper : So we did the initial analysis based around looking at the number of patients with cardiac heart failure and then specifically looking at the subset with heart rates of [70] [ph] and above. And that\u2019s to help us hone down the size of a particular market, the pricing is the pricing is made based on the value proposition we think that we bring into market, obviously we come to market for the first time as a cardiology company and we intend to try and get to as many of those million patients as possible. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Just given the recent outcome of the BP CIA case about and I guess the ruling - the first ruling was that you do not have to go through the patent dance and your confidence in 2017 launch of biosimilar Humira. Can you help me understand like what gives you confidence that the timelines if you were to go through this patent dance won\u2019t go longer because many consultants say that this could go - the BP CIA discussion could go for many years beyond like two-year period or one-year period. So help me understand like giving your knowledge of that process why it won\u2019t take an extremely long time. Thanks. Bob Bradway : Well here Robyn based on our understanding of legislation based on the progress that we\u2019re making and developing at adalimumab. We still expect that we will be in position to launch that in 2017. And of course with respect to the Sandoz matter we\u2019re expecting that I will be heard in the appeal courts later in the year. Tony do you want to add anything? Tony Hooper : We\u2019ve basically debating a concept of 180 days notice. So that\u2019s the debate at the moment. Once we get to a point in time that we would agree to live Sandoz they have the right to come to market at risk. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company. Eric Schmidt : Thanks for taking question. May be a follow-up to Mike\u2019s question on the On-body Injector for Neulasta, Tony, I have no idea of how to put the 800 accounts into context, could you tell us sort of how many accounts you have in general for your last overall and is there a target conversion rate that you are hoping to get say over the next 12 months, what would you define as a successful conversion, could you share with us? Tony Hooper : So the 800 accounts are about 25% of our large customers. And we clearly have a target that we aiming for, I\u2019m not going to be disclosing that at the moment, but we\u2019re driving hard to get a much of our business come to the on-body injector possible. Eric Schmidt : Thank you. Tony Hooper : Brian, will you go on? Operator : Yes, our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Obviously with following your approval of the ivabradine and the upcoming approval of Emab, just wondering if you guys can talk about longer-term thoughts on your cardiovascular franchise because you will be putting your fair familiar sales reps behind these two products, but is there an appetite to continue to add there? Thanks. Bob Bradway : So, Terence it was a little bit hard to hear your questions, but I think you were asking about Corlanor and Repatha, we are excited as we\u2019ve said to get launched in the cardiovascular field with Corlanor and we think again an innovative medicine and it require some work educate to cardiologist about the appropriate use of this medicine with heart failure patients but we are excited about that and we are excited also about the innovative biology behind Repatha and the opportunity for that medicine and make a big difference for our patients with the risk of heart attack and stroke. So, our focus is on those two medicines right now to the extent that we have other opportunities to advance innovative biology with big effects in cardiovascular disease, we will look carefully those. And as you know we have one such medicine that\u2019s in late stage of development now, which is our Omecamtiv mecarbil program, which Sean referred earlier in his remarks, so those constitute three pretty exciting innovative opportunities for us right now and if we find opportunities to build on those we\u2019ll look at them carefully. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS. Matt Roden : Great, thanks very much for taking the questions and congrats on the very nice quarter here. Sean I wanted to ask on the ENDEAVOR trial, the Kyprolis that you reported this quarter so, should we assume that the benefit that you saw with Kyprolis over Velcade was observed in both the Velcade experienced and the Velcade na\u00efve patients, because I think trial allowed both. And then can you also elaborate on the differences that you observed in cardiovascular safety between the agents and just putting it together based on the expert feedback? And how do you think these results will impact the standard of care in myeloma here? Thanks. Bob Bradway : Okay, few questions in there. I\u2019d say yes, we did see a pretty consistent treatment effect of Kyprolis independent of the baseline characteristics of these patients whether they had experienced transplant before whether they had been treated previously with velcade. The CV safety data I don\u2019t have anything additional to say than the information we put in you know the press release until we would be presenting at ASCO. And I do think that this standard of my view on it is that well there is always lots of exciting innovation going on in oncology these days, backbone therapies in this particular disease are going to include a proteasome inhibitor for a good long time and it\u2019s becoming pretty clear that the best agent is Kyprolis. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Citi. Unidentified Analyst : Hi this is [indiscernible] on for Yaron. For Repatha, what do you expect the label to look like? Do you expect standard tolerance to be a specific indication on label or something broader than that. David Meline : Yes. Of course it\u2019s very hard to predict what regulators will decide to do there I think it is possible to write an indication which speaks to patients who are not adequately treated with respect to their LDL cholesterol response with stands or intolerant to stands so if you look at lot of the recent labeling indications that have been used by the agency they have this sort of the structure and that\u2019s kind of in my mind the base case what you\u2019d expect to hope to get in the various jurisdictions that we\u2019re going to be negotiating the labels. But it\u2019s really hard to predict exactly where the language will like. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Howard Liang from Leerink. Howard Liang : Thanks very much and congrats. Regarding the FDA panel for T-VEC next week in recent cases FDA has approved drugs for a narrow indication when the package is less than perfect. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a positive case but can you talk about whether there\u2019s any population where the risk benefit is specially coming for T-VEC. Also are you show the new anyway some of the checkpoint inhibitor combination data at the FDA panel? David Meline : Okay. So the first question which implies that the package is less than perfect I think it\u2019s probably true, yes, that\u2019s true almost everything we do. And I think that in this case it\u2019s clear that the population that we\u2019re studied in the Phase 3 trial included a fairly broad range of patients with local regional and metastatic melanoma disease. And I think if you\u2019ve seen the data that we\u2019ve presented in various scientific forums, the responded durable response rates and the subgroup analysis looking at survival for that matter how the biggest impact in the earlier stages of the disease. So it is possible that\u2019s where the conversation would go and the advisory committee and with FDA but at this point we do have a positive trial for the whole population that we studied and so that\u2019s the logical place to start the conversation. And then with respect to the checkpoint inhibitor all we would be doing at the advisory committee meeting would be to have a slide that will indicate of course the various studies that are going on and going with the product that include the ones I\u2019ve referenced in my prepared remarks as well as certainly being in the capable of presenting the pubically available data with the evolocumab combination the Phase 1b data that we presented previously at scientific forum. Operator : And our next question comes from line of Ying Huang from Bank of America. Ying Huang : Hi. And good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions. First of all I have a question on your biosimilar Humira programs here. Now that you\u2019ve finished both Phase 3 trials already what\u2019s the timeline for a submission in your plans. And then secondly do you plan to seek a broad label including oral indications that you did not try in Phase 3 and then quickly also David R&D cost is coming down much faster than SG&A this quarter compared to a year ago should we expect that to continue and is that driven by research or development? Thank you. Bob Bradway : Why don\u2019t we break that into two parts, Sean will talk about the Humira question first? Sean Harper : Yes. So we do intent to submit Humira later this year the biosimilar later this year. And in fact we would be seeking this sort of a broader labels set of indications through the extrapolation mechanism that is consistent with the current guidances. Ying Huang : Okay. Bob Bradway : David? David Meline : Yes, so in terms of the cost savings what I would fist say is that if you look at the savings we expect this year as well as through the whole program as we\u2019ve said before that those are savings that are being accrued across all of the areas of cost, so it\u2019s not concentrated in one versus the other. And secondly if you look at the particular pattern of savings in the first quarter what you can observe as I mention is that. And as we\u2019ve talked before we are investing freeing up flexibility to invest in our launch portfolio. So you can expect that a substantial share of what we save in SG&A will be reinvested towards the launches and then I think the third thing I\u2019d commented as to R&D that was a combination in the quarter of R&D tends to be rather lumping in terms of the spend. So you saw a combination of savings and that we are getting from our transformation in the quarter as well as some of the inevitable lumpiness that occurs from quarter-to-quarter in that area. So I think bottom line is that we expect going forward through the year to see rising costs which you typically see in the pattern through the year. But see it a little more accentuated as a combination of rising cost with launch activities as well as in the case of R&D we still are continuing to invest in clinical trials and we will see some increases there. And then as to the, if I may one final comment R versus D, and basically as we have talked before we\u2019ve done work to look at all of the processes across all of our business activities and so we are seeing efficiencies in both of those areas broadly. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang from Jefferies. Eun Yang : Thank you. Question on Romosozumab. In the structured trial comparing to Forteo is the change in the BMD if sufficient enough to differentiate it from Forteo or are you following the patient to longer to see difference in non-vertebral fracture risk reduction? David Meline : Yes, so the studies that are being done with Romosozumab versus Forteo are all designed to look at BMD and as you\u2019ve seen probably the data that I presented at the business review shows that in fact those differences are quite substantial but of course we\u2019re also looking at the quality of bone. And in particular the cortical bone thickness which we\u2019ve also looking at using fairly advanced imaging technologies there is no plan for us to do comparative fracture studies against teriparatide at this time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys this is Carter on for Geoff. Tony can you provide a NEUPOGEN share of the short-acting GCSF market for the quarter and I guess more broadly what are your expectations regarding potential timing of a potential biosimilar Neulasta I know some biosimilar companies have disclosed plans to file for approval later this year. Potentially just on a PK-PD study without a Phase 3 study your thoughts there would be appreciated. Thank you. Tony Hooper : Okay. So just remind you in fourth quarter 2014, NEUPOGEN\u2019s market share was 80% first quarter 2015 NEUPOGEN\u2019s market share was 80%. As regard to Neulasta they could end the market towards the end of 2015 when our package expires. Bob Bradway : Hey Brian, why don\u2019t you go at and take one last question as we\u2019re getting to the top of the hour. Operator : Yes. And our last question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan. Cory Kasimov : Hi, good afternoon guys, thanks for squeezing me in. So I want to follow-up on Matt\u2019s question regarding Kyprolis. With the impressive result now I want to hand for ENDEAVOR as well as ASPIRE for that matter how do you think about the implications for the frontline CLARION study perhaps more importantly what is your market research suggest about the relative use of proteasome inhibitors in the frontline multiple myeloma study in relative to later stages of treatment thanks. David Meline : Why don\u2019t I start in terms we can follow-up I think with respect to the CLARION study which of course is the head-to-head study against allocate in the first line setting. We feel that study has been significantly de-risked by seeing the ASPIRE data and the ENDEAVOR data. Now the extent which you\u2019ve been read through results from ENDEAVOR to CLARION is something you know people sit around and debate but certainly we feel good about the likelihood that we\u2019ll see a favorable result from the trial. And Tony, you want to respond to it. Tony Hooper : Probably we\u2019ve done a fair amount of work I mean it all comes down again to what potential outcome of the CLARION trial will be. But as John just said if we continue to going from ASPIRE to ENDEAVOR we assume we\u2019ll have a positive result versus the competition in the marketplace. The objective in multiple myeloma is to drive progression free survival for as long as possible before you have to go onto your second and third line therefore we assume that we\u2019ll be seeing usage in first inline to once we got the indication. Bob Bradway : All right. Corey thanks for your question as you point out things are going very well for Kyprolis and we\u2019re excited about the data that we have in hand as well as the data that we may generate well thanks for joining our call, Arvind and his team will be around if there are questions that you didn\u2019t get a chance to ask on the call. And we\u2019ll look forward to connecting with you on the next quarterly call. Thanks. David Meline : Thank you everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Amgen\u2019s first quarter 2015 financial results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities Operator : My name is Brian and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may begin. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon everybody. I would like to welcome you to our conference call to review our operating performance for the second quarter. It's another strong quarter that provides good evidence that we are on track to achieve our long-term objectives. I'm joined by several members of our leadership team today, including our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway; our CFO, David Meline; Tony Hooper, who heads our Global Commercial Operations; and Sean Harper, our head of R&D. We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by email. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and let me welcome all of you who have dialed in for our second quarter earnings call. The strategy we laid out at our 2014 Investor Day continues to deliver strong results, and our Q2 financial and operational performance is a good indication that we're on track to deliver our long-term objectives. This is an exciting time at Amgen. Not only are we delivering strong financial results, but our new product story continues to take shape as well. It was a successful second quarter on this front, both with recent launches and preparations for upcoming launches well underway. We entered the year excited about six new product launches, and at the halfway point we're already reporting progress on five of them. With its European approval, Repatha was the first PCSK9 inhibitor approved globally. We were pleased with the FDA advisory committee recommendation for approval in the United States and look forward to an approval on or before our PDUFA date next month. When we acquired Onyx, we believed that Kyprolis would become part of the backbone of multiple myeloma therapy by demonstrating superiority over the current standard of care and moving into earlier lines of therapy. The results of ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR exceeded our expectations, and we clearly have an attractive opportunity now with Kyprolis in our expanded indication in relapsed multiple myeloma. The response to BLINCYTO has been positive with physicians, and it's making a difference in certain leukemia patients who have exhausted all other treatment options. The Neulasta on-body injector, our innovative delivery system that provides differentiation in the filgrastim marketplace, is performing well in the few short months since its launch. We're making progress with Corlanor as well by communicating the value proposition to physicians and payers while paving the way for Repatha in the US cardiology community. It's very rewarding to see the difference that these innovative products are making for patients. Beyond these products, our pipeline continued to deliver results, and Sean will provide additional details on our progress in a moment. In addition to what was accomplished in the second quarter, we have other pipeline milestones in the near term including global regulatory submissions for AMG 416, our innovative calcimimetic, and upcoming data from omecamtiv mecarbil in heart failure, romosozumab in osteoporosis, and of course our biosimilar, bevacizumab as well. All of what I've just talked about gives us confidence in the long-term growth of our business. And for this year, we're raising guidance again and David Meline will share details of that with you momentarily. In summary, I'm very pleased with our continuing strong execution against our priorities for the year, and this includes our progress on the five newly launched products, the strong growth in our key products like Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectivix, Nplate, and our ongoing transformation efforts. Before turning over to David, let me just thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their commitment to deliver for patients and for our shareholders. David? David W. Meline - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the second quarter on page five of the slide deck, revenue at $5.4 billion grew 4% year-over-year with product sales growth driven at 6%, driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenue decreased $86 million year-over-year due primarily to milestones recognized in the second quarter of last year. Total revenue and product sales were negatively impacted by approximately 2.5% due to foreign exchange headwinds. Adjusted operating income at $2.6 billion grew 10% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 2 points to 49% for the quarter, reflecting our continued growth and the benefits from our transformation initiative. On an adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 15.1% improved 0.8 points, driven by lower royalties and higher average net sales price. Research and development expenses at $918 million were down 6% versus the prior year. R&D spend was favorably impacted by the transformation in process improvements across the area, partially offset by increased support for later-stage clinical programs. SG&A expenses were up 2% on a year-over-year basis. Increased commercial investments in new product launches were partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. Total operating expenses declined 1% year-on-year and increased 9% sequentially. For the quarter, operating expenses benefited by 3 percentage points from foreign exchange year-over-year. We also saw an increase of spending in Q2 versus the prior quarter, which is a typical pattern for the business. In the second half of the year, we expect quarterly expenses to increase in line to modestly above historical experience, reflecting increasing launch and R&D investments through the balance of 2015. Other income and expenses declined by $65 million or 45% on a year-over-year basis to a net expense of $79 million in the quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by gains in our strategic and venture investments. I would note that Q1 is a better indicator of the underlying run rate for other income and expenses in light of the investment gains in Q2. The adjusted tax rate was 20% for the quarter, a 3.8 point increase versus Q2 2014. This increase was primarily due to unfavorable tax impact of changes in our geographic mix of earnings. Our tax rate for the first half of the year was 18.6%, consistent with our guidance for the year. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 8% on a year-over-year basis. Turning next to cash flow on the balance sheet on page six. For the second quarter, we generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $0.6 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by improved working capital and higher operating income as well as cash gains realized from a portion of our foreign exchange forward contracts. Total debt outstanding ended Q2 at $32 billion, and cash and investments totaled $30 billion. Additionally, our second quarter 2015 dividend was $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior year. Finally, in the second quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity versus the prior year with $500 million of cash deployed through share repurchases, or approximately 3.3 million shares in the period. We continue to execute on the commitment to repurchase $2 billion of shares by year end 2015, and as of now, we have repurchased a total of $1.3 billion worth of shares at an average price of $157 since our business review last October. Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on page seven. We remain on track with our plans to grow the business and invest for the future while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. In 2015, we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of efficiency savings from the transformation, most of which will be reinvested in the business. With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we are increasing our guidance to $21.1 billion to $21.4 billion from our prior range of $20.9 billion to $21.3 billion, reflecting continued solid revenue performance. Versus 2014 results, we'd expect an unfavorable revenue impact of almost $400 million, or 2% in 2015, assuming current foreign exchange rates prevail through year-end. Our revenue guidance also reflects progress on our product launch activities as well as our latest view of evolving competitive dynamics. We are also increasing our 2015 adjusted earnings per share outlook to $9.55 to $9.80 a share from the previous $9.35 to $9.65 forecast. The revised earnings outlook reflects continued conviction in our strategy and strong performance, including lower expenses due to cost discipline. Versus 2014 results, we expect an approximate $0.11 adjusted EPS impact in 2015 at current foreign exchange rates. Turning to the tax rate, for the full year we expect to have an adjusted rate within the range of 18% to 19%. As a reminder, this excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015. We now expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year, which is $100 million lower than our previous guidance. As our results through the first half of the year highlight, our transformation efforts are now well established, and we are encouraged to see cost improvements across the business. This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations : Thanks, David, and good afternoon folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the second quarter on slide number nine. Once again, we delivered a strong sales quarter. We saw excellent execution across all aspects of our commercial strategy, growing our newer products, defending filgrastim and EPOGEN, and launching important new medicines. Globally, product sales grew 6% year-on-year and our US business delivered 9% year-over-year growth, with our international business growing 5% year-over-year excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange. Let me now turn to the products, beginning with Enbrel. On slide number 11, you'll see that Enbrel delivered strong growth of 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by net selling price. Segment growth remains strong in rheumatology and dermatology, growing 23% and 28% respectively. Quarter-on-quarter, we held our share in rheumatology at 29% while share in dermatology declined 1 percentage point to 26%. New dermatology entrants are not simply taking share from the incumbents, but also are growing the market. Quarter-on-quarter, Enbrel sales increased 21%. You will recall that in April, I described how the first quarter was negatively impacted by lower wholesale inventories and end-customer inventory burn-off. In the second quarter, inventories returned to normal levels. Enbrel has delivered significant growth for us. With exclusivity in the US until 2029, we will continue to invest in Enbrel and believe it is well on its way to becoming a $5 billion brand. Sensipar grew 15% year-over-year, driven by strong unit growth in both the US and Europe. I'll now move to Prolia. Prolia delivered 29% growth year-on-year, driven by volume increases in both the US and in Europe. The graph on slide 13 will remind you of the historical path in Prolia's sales, in which the second and fourth quarters are our strongest. Our focus on direct-to-consumer marketing and simplifying patient access in the US continue to drive higher new patient starts and improve patient adherence once on Prolia. This has led to unit share gains of about 4% in the US and about 3 percentage points in Europe. XGEVA grew 11% year-over-year. Unit share increased about 4 percentage points in the US and about 6 percentage points in Europe. The quarter-over-quarter decline in the US was driven by a Q1 customer buy-in. Absent the buy-in, the US sequential unit growth was 6%. Our brand strategy continues to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition. We've also recently successfully negotiated expanded XGEVA access for patients in France, one of our largest markets outside the United States. The expansion of Vectibix into earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer in both the US and Europe continue to deliver growth. We continue to see unit growth in the US of close to 40% and in Europe of nearly 10%. The second quarter was also positively impacted by timing of shipments to our Japanese partner. Nplate grew 6% year-over-year, driven by a 7% unit growth. Now to Kyprolis, which delivered year-over-year growth of 53% and a quarter-over-quarter growth of 10%. We are very excited about the recent US approval in relapsed or second-line multiple myeloma. The ASPIRE data clearly demonstrated the longest period of progression-free survival in any Phase 3 trial to-date. This is an important treatment regimen that now will become available to a greater number of relapsed patients, as shown on slide number eight (sic) [18] (16:44). The US team launched this new indication on Monday this week. The ASPIRE data coupled with our compelling ENDEAVOR data which we've just submitted to the FDA, demonstrating superiority over VELCADE in relapsed multiple myeloma, strengthens Kyprolis' position as the best-in-class proteasome inhibitor. We anticipate further approvals for Kyprolis outside the United States by the end of this year, including Europe, Canada and South America. Let me now turn to our mature brands, starting with the filgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 2%, driven mainly by net selling price. The launch of the On-body Injector for Neulasta is going exceptionally well. As a reminder, the on-body injector means that patients no longer have to return to the hospital or clinic 24 hours after their chemo. The On-body Injector simply delivers Neulasta at home at the appropriate time. I'm pleased to report that the Neulasta On-body Injector has already achieved 8% market share of the Neulasta business in its first full quarter on the market. And we continue to grow both the depth and the breadth of prescribing. Over 50% of our Neulasta accounts have purchased the On-body Injector. NEUPOGEN declined 14% year-over-year in the second quarter. This was primarily due to branded short-acting competition in the US, which came to about 2 share points versus the first quarter. We continue to compete account by account and reinforce NEUPOGEN's long track record of clinical efficacy and safety as well as our ability to supply patients reliably. Turning now to our ESA products. EPOGEN declined 4% year-over-year, including an 11% decline. About a third of this unit decline was due to competition. The remaining unit decline was a shift in purchases to Aranesp in some of our US dialysis accounts. With select US dialysis customers having an increasing interest in a long-acting ESA, we are actively promoting Aranesp to them and have some seen some early success. Global Aranesp sales declined 7% year-over-year. There are some important underlying dynamics however, as the US saw an 8% unit growth per year, driven by the shift in some dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp that I just mentioned, while international sales declined year-over-year because of foreign exchange rates. Although Aranesp has prolonged exclusivity in the US extending to 2024, we know that biosimilars to EPOGEN, NEUPOGEN and Neulasta are making plans to launch the US market. Sandoz announced its intention to launch a short-acting filgrastim biosimilar in the US sometime after September 3 this year, and we expect other biosimilars may come in 2016. Although Sandoz's biosimilar against NEUPOGEN will serve as the first true biosimilar entrant into the US market, Teva's GRANIX has served as somewhat of a proxy, having captured about 17% share of the short-acting filgrastim market after about 18 months in the market. We're planning for the arrival of new competition and are prepared to compete. We will leverage the success that we've had in the US versus branded competition as well as our considerable experience competing against ESA and NEUPOGEN biosimilars in Europe. We expect our products to continue to generate substantial cash flows for years to come, even after competitors enter the market. Let me now update you on our new product launches. As you know, our cholesterol lowering medication, Repatha, was approved in Europe earlier this month. We are very excited to be making this new cholesterol lowering medication available for patients and are actively engaged in obtaining reimbursement across Europe. We anticipate the first European launches to begin during the third quarter of this year. In the US, we look forward to upcoming FDA approval. If you remember, our PDUFA date is August 27. Our cardiovascular sales force is already in the field with the recent launch of Corlanor, which I'll discuss in a moment, and we're hearing a lot of excitement from our customers about the imminent launch of Repatha. We have already achieved 60% plus penetration of eligible patients in the US for BLINCYTO, our innovative antibody for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With an approval based on Phase 2 data, we continue to expand awareness of the significant benefits of BLINCYTO across a physician base that treats these seriously ill patients. We look forward to expanding BLINCYTO's label and our BiTE platform into other cancer types. Corlanor was approved in the second quarter as an add-on to CHF standard of care, and the team is making great progress with penetration and access. With Corlanor, we're also paving the way for our Repatha launch. Our CV sales force has already called on the majority of our targeted cardiologists. As I look ahead, this is a very exciting time for Amgen. I am pleased with the strong performance in the first half of this year, led by our growth products, Enbrel, Sensipar, Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate, and of course Kyprolis. This has given us some excellent momentum into the second half of the year. We've also made tremendous progress with four of our six innovative new launches this year, BLINCYTO, Corlanor and the Neulasta On-body Injector are all off to great starts. And on Monday we launch Kyprolis into the expanded indication of relapsed multiple myeloma. We are anticipating the approval in the US for T-Vec, our novel oncolytic for metastatic melanoma later this year, and Repatha in the US imminently. Our teams are laser focused, poised and ready for launch. We look forward to bringing these new innovative medicines to patients following the FDA approval. Before I close, I would like to express my thanks to our Amgen customer-facing teams across the world for their unwavering focus on delivering value to patients and shareholders alike. And then I'll pass it to Sean. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President, Research & Development: Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. It continues to be, as Tony said, an exciting time at Amgen. And I'd like to begin from an R&D perspective with Repatha, which was the first approved PCSK9 inhibitor in the world, based on our recent approval in the EU. It's important to keep in mind I think, it was early work by Amgen research scientists that led to significant advances in elucidating the pathway by which PCSK9 regulates LDL-cholesterol, and which led to the publication of the crystal structure of PCSK9 in 2007. I just want to recognize the effort within the Amgen R&D organization to advance this program from discovery research to the clinic in less than a decade. As I've said before, having the in-house scientific expertise to elucidate complex biology is an often underappreciated attribute, but it's critical in establishing strong intellectual property. In the US, we were quite pleased with the vote of the FDA advisory committee, and are working with the agency to get Repatha to patients as soon as possible. The FDA's target action date is August 27. We continue to be inspired by the potential for Repatha to help us drive a revolution in the global fight against cardiovascular disease, the world's greatest killer, and are looking forward to the results in 2016 from our intravascular ultrasound imaging study that we're conducting in collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic, as well as our 27,500 patient outcomes trial, which has completed enrollment, and for which we expect results no later than 2017. This is an event-driven study, and as we stated before via the FDA advisory committee meeting, there's a possibility we could see the data in 2016. Turning to oncology. We were very pleased to receive approval from FDA for our Kyprolis submission for relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data. Recall that addition of Kyprolis to Revlimid and dexamethasone resulted in the longest progression-free survival ever reported in the relapsed multiple myeloma setting. And this regimen was considered by the expert discussion at the recent ASCO multiple myeloma session to be, quote, the standard of care. Again in the relapsed setting, we were quite encouraged by the response of physicians at ASCO to the ENDEAVOR data, demonstrating a doubling of progression-free survival in patients randomized to Kyprolis compared head-to-head with VELCADE in the context of much lower peripheral neuropathy risk with Kyprolis. We've submitted the ENDEAVOR data in the United States and will submit these data after the ASPIRE accelerated assessment approval in the EU. We've recently completed enrollment in our Phase 3 CLARION study of Kyprolis versus VELCADE in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, and look forward to those results sometime in 2017. We have also initiated our Phase 3 study of once weekly dosing of Kyprolis in the relapsed refractory setting, potentially providing patients and physicians with a more convenient dosing option. In our continued effort to develop medicines that provide the greatest benefit to patients, we recently reported the results of the studies demonstrating that Vectibix had an overall survival benefit versus best supportive care in a Phase 3 study of chemo refractory metastatic colorectal cancer patients with RAS wild-type tumors. We were gratified to see the support of the FDA advisory committee for the use of T-Vec as a monotherapy in the metastatic melanoma setting, and we continue to work with regulators to bring this agent to patients. We see the greatest potential of T-Vec in combination with the so-called, and we continue to advance our collaborations with the Merck anti PD-1 and Roche anti PD-L1 antibodies that we've recently announced. We also very recently announced the positive Phase 2 study of BLINCYTO in Philadelphia chromosome-positive relapsed refractory ALL, which demonstrated similar efficacy and safety to our US-approved indication in Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL. Approximately one-quarter of adults with ALL are Philadelphia chromosome-positive, and our study included relapsed patients that were refractory to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies who have very poor prognosis. We look forward to discussing the results with regulators to determine next steps. At ASCO, we presented data that demonstrated Prolia significantly reduced bone fractures in breast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitors, suggesting a potential benefit of initiating Prolia with aromatase inhibitor therapy to decrease the risk of fracture. Also in our bone programs, we're getting closer to seeing the fracture data from romosozumab, with the first placebo-controlled post-menopausal osteoporosis study expected to read out in the first half of 2016. Recall that romosozumab is our anti-sclerostin antibody we are developing with UCB. Due to the extent that romosozumab is able to increase bone formation, the high quality of that bone, coupled with strong human genetic validation for the pathway, all of this leads us to believe we will see a significant reduction in fractures and romosozumab will become an important addition to the treatment of osteoporosis. One final regulatory update as we anticipate initiating global regulatory submissions in the third quarter for our innovative peptide calcimimetic, AMG 416, in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Our migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody, AMG 334, is now enrolling Phase 3 episodic migraine studies. The 52-weeks data from our Phase 2b episodic migraine study were recently presented at the meeting of the American Headache Society, demonstrating durability of effect with no new safety signals. Our Phase 2b chronic migraine study continues to enroll patients, and we look forward to seeing those data next year. We continue to view AMG 334 as a very exciting opportunity to help patients suffering from this debilitating condition. In our earlier stage pipeline, we're looking forward to data from our Phase 2 study of the oral formulation of omecamtiv mecarbil, a myocin activator we're developing with Cytokinetics in the heart failure setting in the fourth quarter of this year. We also continue to make progress on our BiTE platform, with our next molecule, AMG 330, close to initiating Phase 1 in the acute myeloid leukemia setting, an area of profound unmet need. We're also advancing new molecules in the clinic, in neuroscience and amino oncology areas, and I look forward to speaking with you about these programs in the future. Finally, I'd like to thank the Amgen R&D team for their continued focus on innovation and execution of our key programs. In particular, I was very proud of our command of the science and the data at our recent FDA advisory committee meetings. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Well, thank you. As you can see, there's quite a lot happening at Amgen, both in the current quarter and things that are setting us up for long-term growth as well. So let's turn to questions. And Brian, before we open the lines, could you remind our callers of the procedure for Q&A? Operator : Yes. And our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey guys, afternoon and thanks for taking the question. For Repatha, assuming that you have a similar label to your competitor, I wanted to get a sense from, and whether you would push to submit imaging data for differentiation, or do you think it makes sense just to wait for the outcomes data? I guess the question is, do you think the imaging data ultimately could be dramatically differentiated in the marketplace. Thanks. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President, Research & Development: Yeah, it's a good question, Jeff. I think that the data from these two types of investigations are really quite complementary. And while we will see from the outcome study, obviously reductions in events, we hope, as we all know how those studies read out. But being able to really understand the degree to which one can observe actual disease modification and regression potentially of the atherosclerotic burden in patients is pretty important information to understand. So I think that we believe that the data are important. There are other precedents for these kind of data appearing in labeled statins. The exact timing relative to when we have the outcomes data is a little hard to judge. But I do think it's differentiating data, and I do think it's going to be very important data for the cardiology community in particular to see this study. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS. Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much for taking the question, and good job on the quarter. So we've been able to see your label in Europe and your competitor's label here in the US. Your programs were similar, but a little bit different in terms of the patients you enrolled. So I guess the question is, would you expect a US Repatha label that's more similar to your EU label, which is little bit broader, or the Praluent US label which is a little bit narrower. And what would be the basis for that position? Thanks very much. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President, Research & Development: Yeah, Matt, I'm not going to speculate about the label that the FDA's going to grant us at this time. We're very close to this process right now with the agency back-and-forth, and I think it's just not our place to speculate on the label they're going to grant us. Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask on the dialysis franchise, you talked a little bit about EPO and Aranesp. Maybe if you could just expand, what sort of competition are you seeing, and would you expect that to get more heated as the quarters progress? And then do you think that the growth in Aranesp's use in dialysis is sustainable, or would you expect that to sort of tail off a bit? Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : All right. Tony? Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations : So I mean I think the numbers that have been made public is that FMC have moved about 45,000 patients to Mircera in the second quarter, so those number of patients will continue into the third and fourth quarters, and that's our competition we're up against (34:47). Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : And the use of Aranesp in dialysis, the sustainability of that, do you want to comment on that? Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations : Well, I mean Aranesp is clearly being used. It's being purchased by the customer, and they have a couple of thousand patients on Aranesp at the moment, and they continue to grow their business as well. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Brian? Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Next question? Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Do you want to go on to the next one? Operator : Yes. Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a two-part one for me. Just on Kyprolis, I was wondering if you can give us any commentary with respect to duration, what you're seeing, and broadening the prescriber base? And then congrats on expanding the board. Just wondering, any comments there that you can provide in terms of that decision? Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Sure, Terence. This is Bob. I'm happy to take the second question. We're delighted to welcome Fred to the board. He has terrific experience in the global biopharmaceutical industry, and I think he shares our enthusiasm for the innovation that's being generated here at Amgen and for our long-term growth prospects. So we're happy to have him on the board. And Tony, why don't you talk about the progress we're making on Kyprolis. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations : So in the third line at the moment, our length of therapy is running at about 5.6 months on average, and when we look at the data in second line, the existing therapies as well as our own clinical trial, we expect the duration of the therapy to at least double over time. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Brian, let's move on to the next question. Operator : Yes. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Thank you for pronouncing my name correctly, and a good quarter. Guys, I was just wondering, I didn't understand, or I just couldn't hear. I got a lot of emails, a lot of other people couldn't either, your answer to someone's question around what's going on in the dialysis marketplace. Fresenius gave out a figure today that 44,000 patients are on Mircera and they also made comments that suggested that the price point of Mircera is dramatically below EPOGEN. So I was just wondering if you could talk about that. And also just update us on the balance sheet. I know after the Onyx deal, you wanted to go through a period of deleveraging where you felt like you probably weren't in a position to do an Onyx type of deal. What about now? How does the balance sheet look now, and if an Onyx sized opportunity came along now, do you believe you've got the financial flexibility to do it, or do you want to continue to delever? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations : So let me clarify the question on dialysis. There are 45,000 patients at FMC on the Mircera product, and there about 15,000 patients on Aranesp. I'm afraid I can't tell you what the difference in price is. You'll have to talk to FMC for that. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Okay, Mark, on the balance sheet, balance sheet's strong. We have emphasized our desire to return capital to our shareholders through a mix of dividend and buyback. As David noted in the call, we increased the dividend by 30% versus this quarter last year, and we're on track to continuing to continue to grow the payout and also repurchasing shares. As David mentioned, we've repurchased $1.3 billion since the investor meeting last October, so we're continuing to focus on returning capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our focus is on earlier-stage transactions that we think can bring innovation to the company that we can add value to, but we have the flexibility in the balance sheet if attractive opportunities arise that are of the larger size. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Thanks a lot. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank. Mohit Bansal - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. This is Mohit for Robyn. Congratulations on a good quarter and progress through the quarter. So my question is regarding the biosimilars. If you could help us understand the implications of the latest ruling in the Sandoz case about that BLA sharing is not necessary under BPCIA. How does it impact your thought process around biosimilar filing? And the second part would be that is Apotex following the BLA sharing process for their Neulasta biosimilar? Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Okay, Mohit. I think there are two questions there. But Tony, why don't you pick those up? Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations : Mohit, it's Tony. In all the strategic planning we've done with the biosimilars, we have accepted the 180 days as part of the legislation and have planned accordingly. As to whether the other organizations have been supplying us data or not, we're not prepared to comment on that at the moment. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Let's go to the next question. Operator : Yes. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Eric Thomas Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC: Maybe just a bigger picture question for Bob on M&A. It's kind of a frenetic environment out there, as you know. Some have viewed Amgen as a target, some view you as an acquirer. I mean how are you thinking about M&A and building shareholder value in today's environment? Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : We're very focused. As I've said earlier on the call, Eric, very focused on executing our long term plan for growth, which we outlined in some detail last October. And I think we're making great progress on advancing the things that we think will enable us to grow and deliver real value for shareholders. So that includes the transformation activities we've talked about, the progress that we're making with our legacy molecules and the new product story that's emerging so powerfully with the five products that we've launched already and those that we expect to launch after this. So very focused on executing our long-term strategy for growth. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang from Jefferies. Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC : Thanks very much. Recently, Merck indicated that REMICADE biosimilar pricing is down about 45%, but then it seems like in some European countries, discounted at close to 60%. So what do you think operating margin for Amgen's biosimilar products would be once they're marketed? Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well Eun, I think if your question's about operating margins for the products that we expect to launch between 2017 and 2021, we'll probably hold off giving you operating margin guidance at this point. If your question was more generally about the pricing environment for REMICADE, happy to share our perspectives on that. Tony, do you want to? Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations : Right, so I mean as we watch the marketplace, obviously as the number of biosimilar competitors come to market, so potentially it could be some more price erosion. The countries outside the United States where REMICADE has experienced such a dramatic reduction in price with the biosimilars, but generally the smaller countries where it is a hospital-based business which is tender driven and the tender winner takes it all. So it's clear that a different structure and a different process in terms of deciding which drugs to use, not by a physician but by the government tenders. Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Bernstein. Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Sean, I just wanted ask you about romosozumab. You highlighted that data coming in the first half of 2016. Could you clarify whether that's the 12 months or the final 24 months data and when you would anticipate filing that program? And I also just wondered what dose you would expect to be filing with them, whether you have a formulation that can deliver it in a single 1 ml injection? Thanks. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President, Research & Development: So yes, we're talking about the primary analysis in the placebo-controlled study, and so that would be at the 24 month time point. And we plan on filing it as soon as we can put it together and file it, obviously. We always do that as fast as we possibly can. It's hard to anticipate without seeing the data what kind of additional questions might be required to be answered and that sort of thing, but this is a very high priority program for us. So we'll certainly be focused on that. And I think it's premature for us to be able to talk about the format in which we would be providing it commercially, but we do feel that it can be delivered once a month likely in a single injection. Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets. Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks for the question. Congrats on the quarter. I had a question for Sean on CGRP. You previously spoke about the advantages of blocking the receptor. Your data as well as others have come out now, so although it's still early, do you think that thesis that you had is playing out? And how do you think your DNA is positioned and how is this going to be differentiated as we go forward now that some of this data has all come out now? Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President, Research & Development: Yeah, yes good question. I think that there's no doubt that the potency of a receptor antagonist is expected from first principals in all the pre-clinical data to be higher than that of ligand sequestration, and that's exactly what we're seeing in humans as well, is particularly you can measure that in the doses that are required to suppress the skin reactions in the capsaicin PD assays that were used by many of the companies in the early phase development. I think really what it comes down to and what I've always referred to is that this will be, this is an ambulatory otherwise well patient population. They're going to want the easiest potential dosing format, once a month let's say, small volume, low-pain injection and a disposable auto injector. The question is whether all of these products can achieve that kind of profile. It's going to be easier for us to do that, we believe, because we have a more potent agent, and so there's only so much antibody that can be packed into a milliliter. And so it remains to be seen whether the ligand antibodies can thread that needle and get to a single injection monthly. Some may, some may not. We're quite confident about being able to do that. So I think it's bearing out scientifically, but we'll have to see whether it translates into a real clinical differentiator in the marketplace, and time will tell. Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to follow up on Eric's questions on M&A. You just announced that Fred Hassan was assigned to the board and we all know that he played an instrument role in Pharmacia, Schering-Plough, Bausch & Lomb. Should we read that into some sort of indication, or we're reading too much into the tea leaves? And then secondly, Enbrel year-over-year growth was mostly driven by pricing. I was wondering if you have any thought on longer-term pricing strength in this market. Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Ying, I think you're over-reading the tea leaves there. As I said, I think Fred shares our excitement about the innovation that's emerging here and the long-term growth prospects for the company. But, Tony, why don't you talk about Enbrel? Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations : So Ying, the pricing of Enbrel will continue to be a consolidation of list prices as well as adjustments in contracts we have with various payers and players in the marketplace, and we continue to see movement or ability to move prices in the future as well, yes. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. For Repatha, do you have any indication as to whether or not you may need to negotiate exclusive formulary contracts with payers, or are you confident that you'll be able to coexist with Praluent on parity contracts? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations : So it's Tony. Let me just say again, we've had some preliminary discussion with payers on a very broad medical basis. Clearly, we're not able to do any negotiations with them until we get full approval from the FDA. Our position has always been that the choice given to both patients and physicians is the most important thing in our marketplace, so we will continue to strive to look for choice. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive Vice President, Global Commercial Operations : Yeah. Operator : And our next - Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Brian, do we have any other questions? Operator : Yes, we have one more question from the line of Ian Somaiya from Nomura Securities. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities : Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to get a sense from you whether the PCSK9 class will be subject to, I guess, class labeling. Or is there potential for nuances, differences in label claims across the I guess two or three drugs that we kind of all know of? Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President, Research & Development: I think you may have gotten cut off there. But this is Sean. Of course, they'll be a degree to which the labeling will look similar across the products, no matter how many there are. I think that will be pretty evident as you see for example the first two labels, whether it's Europe or the United States. However, the products are not developed identically. They don't all have the same studies. They don't all have the same safety profile, in fact. And so I think that you will see differences between the products. And I anticipate that that will be true, because not all of the safety profile for example is mechanism-based. Some of the safety profile issues result from differences in molecular structure formulation and that sort of thing, which can lead to differences in the way that the body reacts to the protein formulation, as an example. And to our knowledge, we're only company doing an IVUS study, for example. So yeah, you'll see differences between the labels, but there will be similarities from a class perspective, for sure. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : All right, well let me thank you all for joining the call. We're looking forward to the second half of the year. A lot of exciting things to come ahead. So we'll look forward to seeing you and having a chance to talk to you on the third and fourth quarter calls. Thank you. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Amgen's second quarter and financial results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speakers\u2019 prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may begin. Arvind Sood : Okay, Brian. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our conference call to review our operating performance for the third quarter. Based on our strong results in Q3, I think you\u2019ll agree that our business is performing well and we are on target to deliver against our long-term objectives and commitments. I think what\u2019s really exciting for us right now is that we are on the verge of a new whole new product cycle that is beginning to unfold. To discuss all these topics and more, in much greater detail, our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway; will lead the call today. Bob will provide an overview of our strategic and operational progress, followed by David Meline, our CFO, who will review our Q3 results and address guidance related issues. Following David, our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will discuss our product performance during the quarter; followed by Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide an update on recent approvals and our pipeline. So before I turn it over to Bob, I will provide my customary comments and reminders. We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by email. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results could vary materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Arvind, let me welcome our listeners to the call. This is an exciting time at Amgen, and once again this quarter, seems we have a healthy dose of information to share with you. So perhaps before jumping in, I should provide some context. I recall that we met with analysts and investors one year ago in New York to layout our long-term strategy for growth and our objectives for the next few years. Since then I\u2019m pleased to report, we made steady progress towards achieving all of those objectives as you\u2019ll hear on this call. Our strategy for long-term growth starts with innovation. We set, as an objective that we would launch six new products this year, and with the approval this week of IMLYGIC, a drug for melanoma, we\u2019re now delivering on the promise of those six opportunities. And of course, we believe that two of these new products, Repatha, for cardiovascular disease and Kyprolis, for multiple myeloma represent particularly significant opportunities for patients and shareholders. Sticking with innovation, I\u2019d like to point out that behind our six new launches, our innovative pipeline continues to advance with rapid Phase 3 progress in our migraine program, strong new data for romosozumab and a successful Phase 3 program for etelcalcetide in kidney disease. In addition, as we reported earlier this week our innovative heart failure program omecamtiv mecarbil delivered promising results in Phase 2b testing, open with prospect of another exciting opportunities for us in the field of cardiovascular disease. Similarly our biosimilar pipeline has advanced considerably over the past year with positive Phase 3 data for two of our nine programs, specifically our humira and avastin biosimilars. And Sean will provide more details on all this progress shortly. In addition to delivering on the promise of innovation with our newly launched products, we\u2019re also delivering strong financial performance across the Board and making steady progress against our longer term financial growth and performance objectives. You can see this in our third quarter results today and in our year-to-date performance. During the quarter, we delivered 14% revenue growth and 18% adjusted earnings per share growth. Our key revenue growth drivers Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar and Nplate all performed well in the period as Tony will convey in his remarks. Adjusted earnings per share grew faster than revenues reflecting improved expense discipline in operating leverage, even as we invested in our new product launch cycle. On a year-to-date basis, revenues were up 9% and adjusted earnings per share are up 19%. Consistent with our long-term financial objectives, our operating performance continues to improve as the benefits of our transformation are reflected across our business. Our 49% adjusted operating margin through the first nine months of the year reflects meaningful progress, against our longer term operating margin targets. Based on our ongoing strong performance, we\u2019re once again raising, our 2015 guidance as David will explain shortly. With respect to capital allocation, adhere to our actions are solidly in line with our commitments. Consistent with our results to return an average of 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders through 2018, with a growing dividend and share buybacks, we expect to increase our quarterly dividend to $1 per share for 2016, an increase of 27%. This comes on the back of a 30% increase for 2015. Also reflecting on our confidence and the outlook for our business, we recently increased our share repurchase authorization to $5 billion. As we look towards 2016, we are focused on delivering continued strong performance, while advancing our new flow of products. Obviously we expect to face increased competition for our legacy products, but we have anticipated these changes and put ourselves in position to defend our legacy products while growing our newer franchises. Given the many variable supply in our business, and to help you in your planning for providing preliminary guidance for 2016, which will update when we report our full year result at the end of January 2016. Finally, let me remind you, that last October we laid out our financial objectives through 2018. A year later we feel confident, we are on track to meet or exceed these objectives. These include $1.5 billion in savings from our transformation, double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth on average through 2018, and adjusted operating margin improvement from 38% in 2013 to \u2013 in the range of 52% to 54% by 2018. Before turning over to David, I\u2019d like to thank my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering commitment to deliver for patients and shareholders as we launch new products, expand internationally and continue from a position of strength, to transform our company for a great future. David? David Meline : Okay, thanks Bob. Turning to the third quarter on Page 5 of the slide deck, revenues at $5.7 billion grew 14% year-over-year, with 14% product sales growth driven by continued momentum across our product portfolio. Other revenues increased $24 million year-over-year due primarily to a milestone received for the filing of kyprolis in Japan. Total revenue in product sales were negatively impacted by approximately two percentage points year-over-year due to foreign exchange headwinds. Adjusted operated income at $2.7 billion grew 19% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved two points to 49% for the quarter, reflecting our continued growth and the benefits from our transformation program along with significant investment in our launch activities. On the adjusted basis, the cost of sales margin at 13.5% improved by 2.2 points driven by net selling prices, lower royalties and manufacturing efficiencies. Research and development expenses at $1.1 billion were up 11% versus the prior year. This increase was driven by up from payments from deal activity in the quarter, and increased investments in support of new product launches. This increase was partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. SG&A expenses were up 17% on a year-over-year basis, driven by commercial investments in new product launches and ENBREL-related payments partially offset by savings from transformation process improvement efforts. Total operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year and increased 8% sequentially. For the quarter operating expenses benefited by approximately three percentage points from foreign exchange year-over-year. We saw an increase of spending in Q3 versus the prior quarter, this reflect the typical pattern from the business, plus our launch investments this year. Other income and expenses declined by $18 million or 14% on a year-over-year basis to a net expense of $147 million in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate was 18% for the quarter, a 0.9 point increase versus Q3 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings. As a result, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share increased 18% on a year-over-year basis. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 6. For the third quarter, we generated $2.7 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $0.2 billion over the prior year. This increase was driven by higher operating income. Total debt outstanding ended Q3 of $31.8 billion, and cash and investments totaled $31.1 million. Additionally our third quarter 2015 dividend was $0.79 per share, an increase of 30% versus the prior year. In the third quarter of 2015, we increased our share repurchase activity versus the prior year with $700 million of cash deployed to share repurchases, or approximately 4.6 million shares in the period. Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2015 on Page 7. We remain on track with our plans to grow the business and invest for the future, while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model, including delivering over $400 million of efficiency savings from the transformation, which is being reinvested this year in the business to fund our significant new product launches. With regard to our updated outlook for 2015 revenue, we are increasing our guidance to $21.4 billion to $21.6 billion from our prior range of $21.1 billion to $21.4 billion reflecting solid revenue performance. Reported growth will moderate as we complete the year, reflecting the expected normalization of relatively high customer inventories as well as the affects of competition on our legacy products. We are also increasing our 2015 adjusted earnings per share outlook to $9.95 to $10.10 per share from the previous $9.55 to $9.80 forecast. The revised earnings outlook reflects our strong year-to-date performance including revenue growth and lower expenses due to cost discipline. For the fourth quarter, we expect operating expenses to increase by around $0.2 billion sequentially, reflecting normal spending patterns as well as continued launch investments. In terms of the adjusted tax rate, our guidance range of 18% to 19% is unchanged, and is consistent with our year-to-date adjusted tax rate of 18.4%. As a reminder this guidance continues to exclude the possible benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in 2015. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year, inline with our previous guidance. As we approach the end of 2015, we are pleased with our progress again this year. We expect to meet or exceed the commitments provided for the 2014 to 2018 period including double-digit adjusted EPS growth on average, $1.5 billion of transformation savings, improving our adjusted operating margin from 38% to 52% to 54%, and returning at least 60% of adjusted net income on average to shareholders. Turning to Page 8, 2016 will be an important year as we continue progress towards our long-term goals. Given the number of moving pieces including new product launches, currency movements and U.S. biosimilar competition, as well as the continued evolution of our transformation program, we want to provide a preliminary planning framework for 2016. As you\u2019ll note, the framework is generally in line with expectations, while individual components may differ. In 2016, revenues expected to range from $21.7 billion to $22.3 billion. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to range from $10.35 to $10.75 for per share. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to range from 20.5% to 21.5%, and capital expenditures will be approximately $700 million. I want to take a moment to highlight several key assumptions embedded in our outlook for next year. First, our revenue guidance range for 2016 includes continued momentum from our growth plans as well as the meaningful contribution from our product launches. We also assume our legacy products face new biosimilar competition in the U.S., which Tony will address in more detail. Next we expect an approximate one percentage point unfavorable impact to revenue and adjusted EPS growth were $0.12 per share due to foreign exchange headwinds in 2016 versus 2015. Assuming that current foreign exchange rates prevail through the end of 2016. This represents an approximate four percentage point negative impact on our international sales. In terms of our transformation program, we expect continued progress in 2016 with an additional $400 million of savings. These savings will be partially reinvested in the business, and will also help drive a year-over-year reduction in total adjusted operating expenses. Finally our 2016 adjusted tax rate guidance reflects an increase versus 2015, and excludes the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit. This increase is primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings as some of our newer products in Enbrel have a higher tax rates under a legacy products. Also U.S. R&D spend is decreasing due to transformation program savings, which has the negative impact on the tax rate. We now expect the tax rate through 2018 to be in the low 20% range. Regarding our capital allocation plan for 2016, we have continued to execute on the commitment to repurchase $2 billion of shares by year-end 2015. And as of now, we have deployed a total of $1.9 billion to repurchase shares. With an increased Board of Directors authorization to $5 billion in total, we expect to repurchase an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of shares by the end of 2016. On a cumulative basis our repurchases will total $4 billion to $5 billion of shares by the end of 2016, since a year ago. We also plan to increase the dividend to $1 per share in the first quarter of 2016, reflecting another 27% increase from current levels. With these actions, we are solidly on the path to meet our commitment return 60% of adjusted net income to shareholders on average for the period 2014 to 2018, while continuing to invest in the long-term growth of the business. In summary, we are pleased with our performance thus far in 2015, and we look forward to delivering results in the remainder of this year as well as in 2016 and beyond. I will now turn the call over to Tony. Tony Hooper : Thanks, David, and good afternoon folks. You\u2019ll find a summary of our global sales performance for the third quarter on Slide number 10. This is an exciting quarter for Amgen as we launched Repatha and continued to deliver strong performance with our growth products. Globally, product sales grew 14% year-over-year and our U.S. business delivered 20% year-over-year growth. Our international business grew 3% year-over-year excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, with the 7% unit growth in Europe. Let me start with an update on Repatha. The European approval of Repatha in July marked the first PCSK9 inhibitor approval in the world. We\u2019re now also approved in the U.S. and Canada. Along with our Japanese partner Astellas, we expect Japanese approval in the first half of next year. We\u2019ve designed Repatha\u2019s clinical program to demonstrate, it is simple, single dose achieving maximal PCSK9 inhibition, provides intensive and predictable cholesterol-lowering. This profile is resonating well with physicians. In the U.S. the launch is off to a good start, we built our salesforce with experienced cardiovascular professionals and we established our presence in the field with our polymer launch in the first quarter this year. Upon approval, our field force was trained and quickly in the fields meeting with our prioritized Repatha customer targets. Anticipating a period of negotiation for payers post approval we launched the Repatha Ready program. This program provides Repatha to appropriate patients if they wish during the insurance verification process, while plans finalize [indiscernible] and fulfillment pathways. The response to our launch is extremely encouraging, as the volume we request to-date is a clear indicator of the unmet need and physician belief in the benefits of Repatha. With the recent formulary decision, Express Scripts recognized the value of Repatha and we continue to negotiate with other payers to expand access in the United States. However, we expect payers utilization management Criteria or UM to remain fairly narrow pending the outcomes data. In the European Union, we continue to negotiate reimbursement with individual countries. We already have patients on Repatha in Germany, in the UK and some Scandinavian countries. The cardiovascular outcomes data and the intravascular ultrasound data in 2016 will continue to expand Repatha\u2019s exciting profile. Repatha also has dosing frequency flexibility, either every two weeks or monthly. And we have submitted our single injection monthly dosing option to regulators. For the launch of Repatha, our continued progress with Corlanor and the recently announced positive Phase 2 results on omecamtiv mecarbil, we\u2019re building a strong foundation for Amgen's cardiovascular franchise. Turning now to Kyprolis, where sales grew 46% year-over-year, and 15% sequentially. The new indication for relapsed or second-line multiple myeloma was launched in the U.S. in July. We\u2019re off to a good start, and from our chart audits, have really seen a doubling of the KRB regimen, which is the regimen in ASPIRE in new to treatment second-line patients. Every month there are about a 1,000 new patients who require second-line treatment. We expect sales to grow as we increase share \u2013 in these new second-line patients and see a corresponding increase in the duration of Kyprolis therapy. We also received priority review for the submission of the ENDEAVOR data, which demonstrated a doubling of progression-free survival compared to VELCADE treated patients. We expect this to drive additional momentum next year, and further strengthen Kyprolis as the best-in-class prednisone inhibitor. We anticipate further approval for Kyprolis, outside the U.S. by the year-end including Canada, Europe, parts of South America and Asia. Let me now turn to Enbrel. On Slide 15, you see that Enbrel delivered 30% growth year-over-year, primarily driven by net selling price. Just to clarify, net selling price includes the impact from list price changes as well as contracting and access changes with recurred over the past 12 months. Inventory growth was 11% which was driven by favorable year-over-year comparison, as the inventory levels have normally low in the third quarter 2014. Segment growth remains strong, in rheumatology and dermatology growing 25% and 38% respectively, year-over-year on a value basis. Quarter-on-quarter, our rheumatology share was relatively stable at about 28% while our share in dermatology declined 2% to 24% due to intensifying competition from new therapies. I would remind you that rheumatology accounts for about 80% of Enbrel sales. Sensipar grew 29% year-over-year, driven by inventory net selling price and unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe. Similar to Enbrel, the inventory growth was driven by unusually low inventory levels in quarter three last year. I\u2019ll now move to Prolia. Prolia followed its normal seasonal pattern for the sequential decline in quarter three, but on a year-over-year basis delivered 25% growth, with unit growth exceeding 20% both the U.S. and Europe. Growth was driven by continued share gains of about three percentage points in both the U.S. and Europe. XGEVA grew 19% year-over-year. Unit share increased about four percentage points over the last year in the U.S. and about 5% points in Europe. There were, however, some abnormally large purchases by some end customers in the U.S. this quarter, adding to the volume growth. We continue to focus on XGEVA\u2019s superior clinical profile versus the competition. Vectibix is showing flat volume, this is solely due to the timing of shipments to our Japanese partner, Takeda, who hold the license in Japan. The U.S. delivered year-over-year growth of 16% and Europe 12%, both driven by the expansion of Vectibix into earlier lines of therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer. Nplate continued to deliver solid growth of 15% year-over-year driven by 17% unit growth. Now I\u2019ll turn to our mature brands, starting with the filgrastim franchise. Neulasta delivered year-over-year growth of 6%, driven by net selling price and the inventory. Similar to XGEVA, we saw signs of abnormally high purchases by some larger end customers in quarter three, which we would expect to burn off in quarter four. Meanwhile, the on-body injector for Neulasta, which we\u2019ve now branded as part of the Neulasta Onpro kit continues to gain adoption in the marketplace. Over 60% of our Neulasta accounts have now purchased the Onpro at least once. And Onpro achieved 19% share of Neulasta units in quarter three. NEUPOGEN declined 5% year-over-year, driven by branded short-acting competition in the U.S. Sequentially quarter-over-quarter, we held share against branded competition and saw minimal impact from the new biosimilar competition, given its launch late in the quarter. Using our seven years of biosimilar defense experience in Europe, we will be competitive in the marketplace, but expect share erosion in the near-term due to the new competition. Turning to our ESA products, EPOGEN declined 6% year-over-year, including a 15% unit decline as dynamics continued to evolve in the U.S. dialysis centers. That\u2019s 15% unit decline would have been deeper if not for abnormally high purchases by a large end customer in quarter three. Fresenius has now moved more than half its patients from EPOGEN to Mircera, and we expect the trend to continue. Please recall that we have a contract with DaVita through 2018 in which they will purchase at least 90% of their ESAs from Amgen. We are also seeing strong Aranesp adoption with medium size and independent dialysis centers. Of the other 400,000 dialysis patients in the U.S., about 50,000 patients have now transitioned to Aranesp, including about 20,000 in Fresenius. EPOGEN sales in future quarters will be impacted by utilization at Fresenius, potential switching to Aranesp, and potential biosimilar competition. Aranesp sales increased 4% year-over-year with a 32% growth in the U.S. driven by the shift in dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp that I was just talking about. International sales will be impacted by foreign exchange rates. While we continue to see a decline in oncology ESA use, we are pleased with the response to Aranesp in the U.S. dialysis business. We are making good progress with our launch of BLINCYTO. BLINCYTO [indiscernible] taken in the most severe ALL patients, and as the ALL patients cycle through different therapies we will continue to grow patient penetration. In summary, quarter three was an exciting quarter. Our Repatha and Kyprolis launches began in earnest and we delivered strong results for our growth products and continued to defend our mature products in the marketplace. Please keep in mind the additional inventory in the third quarter for Neulasta, EPOGEN, and XGEVA, as some of our larger end customers exceeded about $100 million, and we expect this to reverse in quarter four. Looking ahead to 2016, our growth products including Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix, and Nplate are continued to \u2013 are expected to continue to deliver solid growth as sales for these products have grown in double-digits this year, and in some cases in excess of 20% on a base of over $9 billion. We are also building momentum with our launch products including Repatha and Kyprolis, and we expect they will deliver more meaningfully to the top line in 2016. We will defend against increase in competition to our mature franchises with an assumption of no additional biosimilar competition before the second half of 2016. Before I close I'd like to thank our teams across the world who continue to work tirelessly, ensuring access for patients to our innovative drugs. Let me now pass you to Sean. Sean Harper : Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. Amgen's R&D efforts are rolling along nicely with six major regulatory approvals of innovative products for serious diseases over the last year. This is the core of what we do, invest in true innovation in order to change the practice of medicine. Today, I'll begin with some comments on our cardiovascular programs. We recently submitted a supplemental BLA to offer patients a single dose option for the 420 milligram monthly dose of Repatha, utilizing an automated device as part of our previously announced collaboration with West Pharmaceutical Services. And the FDA has communicated a July 2016 PDUFA date. As we previously announced, based on our current modeling of our event driven cardiovascular outcome study, we anticipate the number of events required for final analysis to accrue by about the middle of 2016. With the top line data expected to follow in the second half of the year. We also anticipate the results of our coronary artery intravascular ultrasound study in the second half of 2016. We believe that demonstrating a disease modifying effect on arthroscopic plaque burden would be a compelling result, complementary to our outcomes data. In addition, we were very pleased at our Phase 2 oral dosing study of AMG423 or omecamtiv mecarbil, a myosin activator we are developing with cytokinetics in the setting of chronic heart failure met all of its objectives. We've already begun reviewing these data with our partners, key opinion leaders and soon with regulators, to better understand the potential role of omecamtiv in the treatment of chronic heart failure patients. Regarding our CETP inhibitor, we have flexibility to gain our R&D investment going forward after a careful review of Lilly CETP outcomes data when they become available. Turning to oncology. Following on the U.S. label expansion, Kyprolis has received a positive opinion by the EU CHMP for the ASPIRE submission, and we will submit the ENDEAVOR file once the ASPIRE approval occurs. In the U.S., the ENDEAVOR file is under priority review, with an action date in January of 2016. Finally our Phase 3 study of a weekly dosing regimen for Kyprolis in the relapsed refractory setting is actively enrolling. Turning to immuno-oncology in the realm of biospecific T-cell engagers, we\u2019ve received a positive opinion in the EU from the CHMP for BLINCYTO, in the setting of Philadelphia negative relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our next molecule based on the BiTE platform AMG 330, directed at CD33, has entered testing in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, an area of profound unmet medical need. The treatment paradigm for this disease, which is approximately four times as common as adult ALL, has not changed meaningfully in 20 years and the prognosis for these patients remains bleak. Finally, we\u2019re excited to have licensed in Xencor by specific antibody platform for six targets, including particularly an anti CD38 T-cell engaging molecule in the preclinical stage, given our focus in multiple myeloma. As we announced yesterday, the FDA approved IMLYGIC for the local treatment of unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous and nodal lesions in patients with melanoma recurrent after initial surgery. Despite the concept being around for more than a century, IMLYGIC is the first oncolytic viral therapy to be approved, and represents an important new treatment option for melanoma patients. IMLYGIC also received a CHMP positive opinion for the treatment of adults with unresectable metastatic melanoma in the EU. While this initial indication is for a relatively small population of melanoma patients, we believe the real promise of IMLYGIC is in the combination with other immunotherapies. So we continue to advance the combination studies with the anti-CTLA4, anti-PD1 and anti-PDL1 antibodies that we\u2019ve previously announced. The safety data from the Phase 1b portion of the IMLYGIC keytruda combination melanoma study appeared quite favorable, and were recently presented at the European Cancer Congress. We look forward to seeing the efficacy data from this study and continue to explore other possible combinations. Leaving oncology, we\u2019ve completed our U.S. and EU submissions for our novel intravenous calcimimetic etelcalcetide or AMG416, in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Turning to our bone franchise we\u2019ve recently seen two data sets for Romosozumab, our anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody, in development with UCB for postmenopausal osteoporosis. First we observed superiority to teriparatide in an open label Phase 3 study as the level of bone mineral density in patients heavily pretreated with these false names. Second at the American Society of Bone and Mineral research, we presented data from an exploratory sub-study of a Phase 2 trial, demonstrating superior calculated bone strength versus teriparatide in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. And of course we look forward to seeing the first of our two fracture outcome studies in the first half of next year. Recall, this is a two year study with patients receiving either romosozumab or placebo treatment in year one, followed by Prolia treatment in year two. Our most migraine prophylaxis program with our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody, AMG334, is actively enrolling two Phase 3 episodic migraine studies. The enrollment rate suggests to me a very strong clinical need for an effective, well tolerated migraine prophylactic agent. Our Phase 2b study in the chronic migraine setting is enrolling nicely as well, and we'll see those data next year. Behind AMG334 in our migraine pipeline, our anti-PAC 1 receptor antibody, AMG301, is progressing through Phase 1. We\u2019re pleased about our partnership of this emerging franchise with Novartis. Of course the other exciting aspect of our collaboration with Novartis is the base program for Alzheimer's disease. It was scientist at Amgen who first cloned the base gene and decode has provided compelling genetic validation of this target. Here, we're taking a differentiated approach based on the concept that it may prove difficult to demonstrate a convincing disease modifying effective base inhibition, when intervening in patients who have clinically detectable cognitive impairment. By studying cognitively normal patients, genetically predisposed to late onset Alzheimer's by virtue of their APOE4 genotype, essentially intervening earlier in the disease course, we may be able to more effectively demonstrate the disease modifying effect. This study is being conducted with the Banner Institute which has identified a large number of these patients and this coupled with our human genetics platform, provides a unique opportunity to pursue this novel approach. Finally, our biosimilar programs continue to advance. The team is preparing for submissions from our biosimilar humira by year-end, and our biosimilar avastin in Phase 3 study in non-small cell lung cancer successfully completed. Our biosimilar assessment study in breast cancer recently completed enrollment and we expect to see the data sometime in the second half of next year. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank the Amgen R&D team, for their dedication to patients during this remarkably busy and exciting time. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay, thanks. As Sean said this is an exciting time and a lot going on at the Company, so let's open it up for questions now. If we can ask our Operator to remind everybody of the procedure. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS. Matt Roden : Great, thanks very much for taking the questions. Congrats on a very nice quarter. I guess David, when I\u2019m looking at your new preliminary 2016 guidance we\u2019re seeing, it falls just a touch below consensus. Just wanted to get your sense for whether or not we should be looking at the revenue side or the margin side or tax side, what is it that you think the street is missing, and if it is the revenues is it related to biosimilar competition, or lower than the street expectations on PCSK9? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for where you think we\u2019re off? David Meline : I\u2019d say the one place that kind of jumps out is if you look at the tax rate which is up year-over-year, more than actually we previously indicated the rate would go to, is probably the biggest area where we see some differences, which is frankly part of the reason why I thought it would be helpful to give you a preliminary view of what we think is going on in 2016. I think the good news in that regard is while we\u2019re generally in line with consensus overall it would imply I think that we\u2019ve got somewhat better operating performance we see for the business next year than perhaps the analysts have in their models right now. Bob Bradway : David do you want to reiterate your R&D tax credit point as well, just to make sure that Matt and others would\u2026 David Meline : Yes, so the rate that we\u2019ve got out there for next year as is the case with this year, again we\u2019ve chosen to exclude the R&D tax rate from the calculate \u2013 the R&D tax credit because of the ongoing uncertainty of that eventually being passed and impacting unfavorably on the rate. Bob Bradway : Okay, go to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on all the progress. Maybe just two quick ones for me. First on the Repatha launch, can you give us the sales number for the quarter? And then any comments on the breadth of prescribing you\u2019re seeing and types of patients? And then on the pipeline, Sean, you mentioned omecamtiv, what are the key outstanding questions there and just timing of next steps for that program, thank you? Bob Bradway : Hi, Tony. Tony Hooper : Terence, it\u2019s Tony. So let me respond. I mean, obviously we launched in September, so it was not much of a quarter, so I think you\u2019ll probably see a better reflection of sales in the fourth quarter and once we finish all our negotiations. The utilization criteria the payers are putting to place are pretty much in line with the label at the moment, so high-risk patients with diagnosed after a disease who have LDL above 130, that's where we see the patients. Bob Bradway : Tony, you want to talk about the European piece of the launch as well? Tony Hooper : Sure. So we have launch in Europe as we know, and we do have patients at the moment in the UK, some Scandinavian countries and Germany. David Meline : Great, and with respect to omecamtiv mecarbil, what I would say is that we're in the usual stage of having just seen these data. We have partners to review the data with we're working with really the top key experts in heart failure from around the world and have been for years on the program. So we have to review the data with them and of course talk with the regulators through the usual and the Phase 2 sort of meetings before we can reach a formal decision about whether to proceed and in what exactly format, in terms of study designs and that sort of thing. So it's all the usual steps that we have to go through for a very significant decision to advance into \u2013 outcomes trial in a setting like congestive heart failure, but we are very pleased with the data that we generated from the study. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets. Michael Yee : Hi, thanks, good afternoon. I wanted to ask a little bit more in the guidance. I guess just broadly speaking can you be more clear on what actually spurred you to talk about 2016 already? And in terms of the biosimilar assumptions there, is it safe to say to be more specific you don't expect a GCSF \u2013 excuse me a long acting GCSF any time before at least second half of 2016? And with that, do you therefore expect to assume a high penetration of the on-body device and where do you think that can go to in terms of penetration, thanks? Bob Bradway : Michael in terms of why we decided to provide a preliminary framework today, it\u2019s really as we looked at it, as we look into 2016, what we observe is there\u2019s a lot of dynamics going on. And as I mentioned, we\u2019ve got a number of new products that we see launching as you know, we are now approved for the sixth one as we had hoped. So what's going on with that, what's going on with the competitive environment in terms of our legacy portfolio, obviously foreign exchange and then our own efforts to improve the competitiveness of the business. So my feeling was that it would be useful to you guys in that at the end of October, you're starting to look more specifically at 2016, so I thought it would be useful to provide that initial indication today. And as I said earlier, the sort of the expectations are generally in line with what we said today, but there\u2019s some differences. So we just thought it would be helpful to you guys to get something out there. So maybe Tony wants to comment on the other piece? Tony Hooper : Sure, I mean, let me then just add that, as we look at the assumptions in place by 2016 numbers, we don\u2019t assume any new additional biosimilars until the second half of 2016. As regard to the on-body Injector for Neulasta, we continue to be very excited about the launch and the uptick in the marketplace. As I said, just over 60% of our customers or accounts that have actually purchased at least once, and the average market share was about 19% in the third quarter and that market share keeps growing. Bob Bradway : Brian, let\u2019s take the next question. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company. Eric Schmidt : As well, maybe for Tony or even Bob. Just kind of curious on the U.S. pricing environment, whether you think there\u2019s been any real or perceived changes in that outlook? Tony Hooper : Eric, obviously that\u2019s a topical question. I guess the important thing from our perspective is to reflect on what our business model is, which is to develop innovative medicines directed against serious diseases, and we tried advance medicines that have a big effect for patients and with that, big effects for society. So if you look at the six medicines we\u2019re launching, that\u2019s exactly what the medicines represent, and you know we think medicines that have a big effect size for patients, medicines that create value. And so we anticipated this moment and the development work that we\u2019ve been doing, anticipated it in our strategy, and then the molecules that we\u2019ve chosen to advance. So again, this doesn\u2019t come as a surprise to us, that there are questions about the value of the medicines and the price and we think the more we can do to help focus on the economic burden of diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, neuro-degenerative diseases and the significant prospect or opportunity that our medicines represent against those, the more appropriate framing for the discussion. So I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything particularly precipitous changing for those of us that are at the innovative biopharmaceutical and other than the fact that we\u2019re incredibly exciting window of time here with lots of important new innovative medicines against, again some of the vaccine, tough diseases that we all face. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Vikram Ashoka : Hi, this is Vikram on for Matthew. So just two quick questions from our side. So, first could you talk about the sustainability of price increases that you saw with Enbrel and EPOGEN, especially with EPOGEN if you could touch on the share losses to Fresenius, that would be helpful. And then secondly, you touched on this a little earlier during the call, but if you could quantify the impact of end-user purchasing patterns on Neulasta, that would also be very helpful. Bob Bradway : I think there are three questions there. So Tony do you want to try and tackle the EPOGEN? Tony Hooper : So, just to Bob\u2019s point again, right? So the price increases we take in the marketplace are based on the value of our products bring to market and the competitive environment in which they operate. In the EPOGEN situation, Fresenius, it represents about one-third of the marketplace in the U.S. and they are in the process of converting a large amount of their business to Masera. I think they will be probably be announcing within the next couple days, how much of their business they have converted. And I didn't get the question on Neulasta, sorry. Bob Bradway : Repeat the third question you had there? Vikram Ashoka : End-user purchasing patterns on Neulasta? Tony Hooper : So what was the question about end-user? Vikram Ashoka : Just how much end-user inventory? Tony Hooper : Okay, so, net-net as I said the end-user purchases for Neulasta, Xgeva and EPOGEN were just in excess of $100 million in the third quarter, and we expect that to burn off in the fourth quarter. Vikram Ashoka : All right. Bob Bradway : Okay, Brian, let\u2019s take the next one. Operator : Okay. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Mark Schoenebaum : Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a great headline print. I had a couple questions. Number one, for Fresenius has taken much more share as has been mentioned in other questions. I'm wondering why. Is it simply that you will not match price? Because I think last quarter, you mentioned something about how, and when do such contract negotiations happen? And so it sounds like you're sort of guiding us to give up on Fresenius and I want to know is that because the Masera is offering a price that Amgen just doesn't think is economical to match? My second question was on biosimilar humira, is it still your expectation Bob that you're going to launch in 2017? Because Rick Gonzalez, AbbVie, your counterpart, absolutely insists like table pounding, heavy breathing, that there's no way that's going to happen before like 2019 or so. So I'd just like to get your updated thoughts on that? And finally can you give us any indication whatsoever, any, about what our expectations should be for gross to net discounting for the PCSK9 class, either right now early days or more steady state level. Because that's what we need obviously in our models, thank you. Bob Bradway : Okay, let\u2019s see whether we can tackle those. I think there was three questions there Tony. The first one was about, presenting a similar respond to Mark\u2019s question? Tony Hooper : So we have no idea what the agreement is between Fresenius and Roche who is supplies Masera to them. And our pricing decisions, I\u2019ll tell you might not just on our contract with Fresenius but the overall dialysis market in the U.S. And so we are balancing existing customers and customers who were possibly changing their portfolio. Bob Bradway : And gross to net Tony you want to? Tony Hooper : On gross to net we don\u2019t make public any of the contract negotiations we have with the payers. Bob Bradway : Obviously, we\u2019re \u2013 the negotiations continue to be underway here in the U.S. and internationally. And with respect to Humira, Mark, we are excited about confidence in the clinical data that we have and as you would expect we\u2019re preparing to file those data with regulators. We recognize that there is intellectual property here that needs to be respected but we will continue to advance our molecule and continue to assess the intellectual property that\u2019s in place. And if we have a dispute, well the good news is, there\u2019s a process for resolving that dispute and we will push forward on that basis. Arvind Sood : Okay Brian, we will take the next one. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan. Cory Kasimov : Hey, good afternoon guys, thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to follow-up on the 2016 guidance questions and ask if you can at least qualitatively speak to your comfort level with the Street\u2019s Repatha expectations for next year. And then also on PCSK9 front, should we expect the deal with Express Scripts to set a precedent for comparable agreements with other payors going forward? Thanks a lot. Bad Bradway : Again two questions here, Cory with respect to guidance for 2016 we\u2019re not giving individual product line revenue guidance. Again I think David addressed pretty comprehensively what our thinking was in general about the P&L for 2016 and we hope that it\u2019s up to have it at this stage in the game. And with respect to what to expect from other payers again Tony you care to comment on that? Tony Hooper : We were delighted that Express Scripts left the option of which drug to use to physicians and patients and we continue to believe that\u2019s the best place to be in the marketplace. That\u2019s our position as we go out to market but we are in the middle of negotiations so we don\u2019t know where we are going to land. Cory Kasimov : Okay, understood. Thank you. Tony Hooper : Okay. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America. Ying Huang : Thank you for taking my questions as well. Specifically I have one for Enbrel. When you provide 2015 guidance, what\u2019s your assumption for the pricing trend? I know you can\u2019t spell out the details, but can we expect somewhat similar level of pricing for 2016? And then on E12 in the market for dialysis, obviously we know what happened with Fresenius, but what\u2019s your expectation for the other one-third independent dialysis centers of the market. And then I guess lastly, given the recent biotech, I guess correction in the market, what\u2019s your thought of M&A in terms of being opportunistic here? Thanks. Bob Bradway : Well, let me answer the question around the independent and the dialysis units. Right now they receive the supply from us. We are delighted to see the level of switching that\u2019s taking place from EPOGEN to Aranesp amongst both the independence of both the medium and small dialysis centers. So we\u2019ll continue to work with them as we go forward. On Enbrel, the net price always depends on a combination of price increases on list versus large amounts of contracting. Enbrel competes at a highly competitive environment, where payers make decisions around where products are on their more reason in terms of a preferred tier and non-preferred tier based on the rebates. And when you\u2019re on a preferred tier you pay rebate, if you aren\u2019t a preferred tier you don\u2019t pay the rebate. So it\u2019s a huge amount of dramatic changes inside hundreds of additional plans. Tony Hooper : Okay. And then on the M&A question, Ying. As we said a year ago, that we would focus on early stage transactions and if you look at the activity that we engaged in over the past 12 months, you can see we brought in a lot of earlier stage innovative new products and technology opportunities. And we said more recently that we\u2019re opening the aperture a little bit, beginning to look at our broader range of things including potentially some larger things. We think obviously that the valuations in the sector are probably more favorable now for the later stage assets than they were a year ago. And so, we\u2019re continuing to look and I think it may be some time, however, before the owners of those late stage assets adjust their pricing expectations to reflect the current trading environment. But we\u2019re continuing to look for nothing to report on the call. Bob Bradway : Brian\u2026 Operator : And our next question\u2026 Bob Bradway : Yes, go ahead. Operator : Yes. And our next question comes from Eun Yang from Jefferies. Eun Yang : Thanks for the question. A question on Kyprolis. I understand that the Kyprolis has a greater path of improvement versus elotuzumab, but some physicians comment that the mix of different degrees overlaps the patient population, makes it difficult to compare across the study data. Now with elotuzumab entering the market already next year, can you share with us, what you are hearing as to how physicians who would utilize Kyprolis versus elotuzumab in the relapsed setting? Sean Harper : Yes, I think, it is I think just very early days in my view to assess that and I think there\u2019s some in general the theme that I continue to hear when I talk to experts in this area is the concept that they don\u2019t view molecules like blinatumomab as things that are likely to displace a proteasome inhibitor from the backbone therapy in multiple myeloma, but rather looking at them as adjunct therapies, so our strategy is to be the preferred best-in-class proteasome inhibitor and to have adequate combination data of course with a lot of these new molecules as they come along to make sure that we are part of the best-in-class regimens for the disease. Bob Bradway : And I think just to add to that Sean I think what we demonstrated in the ASPIRE study was unprecedented in terms of PFS in the second line relapse setting and the data that was presented elotuzumab is so-called eloquent study again difficult to make cross trial comparisons but is certainly was not comparable to what we saw. David Meline : No, it certainly not. I think the question presumed that you can\u2019t make the comparison as well across the studies and of course we all recognized there are limitations to making study \u2013 cross study comparison. Tony Hooper : Just to remind everyone that the product not approved in the U.S. yet so I think we should wait until the FDA makes a decision and we can see a label. Bob Bradway : Okay, let\u2019s go to the next question? David Meline : Well, take the next one. Operator : Yes. And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays Capital. Geoff Meacham : Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. One, Repatha, obviously the tipping point in utilization is going to come from the outcomes data but that speaks I think to the sickest patients getting access today. And so I know it's early, but any common features so far in new starts beyond LDL, things like prior statin experience or cardiac events and then would you expect this to differ in the EU looking out say 6 to 12 months? Thanks. David Meline : Okay, Geoff thanks for the question. Tony why don\u2019t you\u2026 Tony Hooper : So Geoff, let me just reiterate I mean having long \u2013 a number of cardiovascular drugs in my life this one feels pretty good. I mean the level of discussion we\u2019re getting among cardiologists and high prescribing primary care physicians is more than what I would have expected. They really understand the value of lowering LDL and understand what the statins have delivered in terms of the outcomes data, so in my mind, the understanding is there, the demand is there, and the need is there. The slow march we are taking with payers in the U.S. of course is reducing the opportunity for patients to get access to these drugs early, with the likelihood of Express Scripts having made this decision and we work actively with the other guys to get product up and running. The utilization criteria at the moment they\u2019ve set in places is fairly tight to insure that patients step through a number of situations, but I continue to believe that what we are seeing in terms of patients being referred to the hub for insurance verification, I feel pretty confident about that. In Europe, of course the label is slightly broader but we do take longer to negotiate with the various countries country by country in Europe. Bob Bradway : Okay, Brian, as we are at the top of the hour why don't we take two more questions? Operator : Okay, let\u2019s see. And we do have a question from the line of Brian Skorney from Baird. Colleen Hanley : Hi, this is Colleen on the line for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. I know we're still early in the launch but can you comment on how many patients have started on Repatha? And can you also comment on the regulatory pathway for oral LDL lowering drugs like CTEP inhibitors or other mechanism for statin lowering and the need for cardiovascular outcome studies versus the more accelerated paths you're able to take with Repatha? Thank you. Tony Hooper : This is Tony. The IMS data has not been very clear in terms of actual prescriptions up until about a week or two ago, so I would imagine the data the terms are coming now is accurately representing the number of patients receiving a prescription from a pharmacy. This of course doesn't take into account the patients that are moving through the hubs either run by ourselves or by our competitors, assisting patients during the verification process, as plans go through their formulary and guideline of pathway process to decide how and when to allow the usage of these PCSK9s. Bob Bradway : With respect to the regulatory environment for other mechanisms such as CTEP inhibition, I think what I would say we're going to observe is what we saw with the PCSK9 class, which is regulators really taking into account in their determinations around what evidence base would be necessary to gain market access, and what kind of population should be included in initial labeling prior to outcome studies, that's going to be predicated very much on mechanism. And I think in the case of PCSK9, there was a certain value placed on the science that underlies that mechanism and the fact that thus far, we\u2019ve not had a situation for example, where the mechanism had been tested and failed in large outcomes trials so it\u2019s going to be a case-by-case determination by regulators based on the mechanism and the evidence base that exists and whether or not there is safety overlay and that sort of thing. So it\u2019s not a simple question to answer. I think but I think that the parameters that will be weighed are fairly clear. Operator : And we have a question from the line of Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Chris Raymond : Question on Enbrel. So I'm looking at the math on Slide 15 and it seems to make some sense with respect to price making up the difference when you factor in inventory and units, but just want to clarify. Do you see and is it also possible that a quarterly driver could be changes in rebates and discounts? Is that a measurable impact at all quarter-on-quarter, especially this quarter? Tony Hooper : So normally contracts are for annual period but by definition, any change in a contract will then impact your year-over-year calculations for four quarters in a row, so clearly, there are contract changes that impact the net selling price in quarter three, yes. Chris Raymond : Okay, thank you. Bob Bradway : Okay, great. Well, thanks everybody for participating in our call and you know myself and my team will stick around for a while, so if you have any other questions or thoughts feel free to give us a call. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes Amgen\u2019s third quarter and financial results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Nick Abbott - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : My name is Jake Long, and I'll be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay, thank you, Jake. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our conference call to review our operating performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. I would particularly like to acknowledge those who are new in their coverage of Amgen, including Steve Chesney of Atlantic Equities in London, Ronny Gal of Bernstein, Alethia Young of Credit Suisse, Hartaj Singh of BTIG, and Brian Skorney of Baird. Welcome. Each of us look forward to working with you and helping you understand of our company. We have a lot of ground to cover today, so let me make some very quick introductions. Leading the call today will be our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, who will provide a strategic report on our performance in 2015 and outlook for 2016. Following Bob, our CFO, David Meline, will review our Q4 and full-year results and update you on our previous preliminary financial guidance for 2016. Tony Hooper, our head of Global Commercial Operations, will then discuss our product performance during the quarter, with a particular focus on newly launched products. Following Tony, our head of R&D, Sean Harper, will provide a pipeline update. We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by email. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, thank you, Arvind, and let me add my welcome to those of you who are joining our call. Let me start off by saying that 2015 was an exceptional year for Amgen. It was another year of consistent and reliable performance as we delivered for patients and shareholders. I think you can see that first in our financial results. Eight percent revenue growth in 2015 reflects the strength and breadth of our products, and our 19% adjusted earnings growth reflects the operating leverage we've created through our successful and ongoing transformation efforts. The momentum of our products can be seen in the 17% growth we recorded from our inline brands, including Enbrel, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix, and Nplate. Together these brands generated $11 billion for us. Our legacy medicines also performed well, and these continue to be strong cash flow generators for us. And we remain positioned to compete as new players enter the market. While delivering these solid results for the year, we also laid important groundwork for our future growth with four innovative launches in oncology and two in cardiovascular disease over the past 12 months. As we've said before, we expect Repatha and Kyprolis to be significant opportunities for us, and see these as great examples of innovative medicines that address big unmet needs by providing significant clinical benefits and demonstrable value propositions for patients and providers. The importance of having value propositions such of these is only said to grow in the innovative biopharmaceutical industry, and we're well-positioned to embrace that reality in our pipeline. Developing innovative medicines to address serious illness is at the core of what we do. Behind our six new product launches are a number of additional exciting innovative pipeline opportunities, notably romosozumab in bone health; and AMG 334, which is directed at migraine in the neuroscience area. Also of note is our nephrology product, etelcalcetide, which is under regulatory review, and omecamtiv mecarbil, which is an intriguing opportunity for us in cardiovascular disease. In addition to our own pipeline of molecules, we expect to remain active in business development. When it comes to later-stage opportunities, we would expect this to revolve around our six core areas, which are hematology/oncology, cardiovascular, inflammation, bone health, nephrology, and neuroscience. Focus will remain important to us, and you see that reflected in our decision this week to out-license our respiratory molecule, AMG 282. While we were intrigued by the genetics behind this target and the potential for the molecule in asthma and COPD, we feel the commercialization of it can be better optimized by Genentech, given their established presence in this field. We continue to expand our global geographic reach, now with full ownership of our products in new markets and the very exciting approval of Repatha in Japan with our partner Astellas, which represents our first product approval for this Japanese partnership. Our biosimilars program is also making tangible progress, with one under regulatory review, one having completed Phase 3, and another for which Phase 3 results are expected later this year. We're making significant progress with our transformation efforts here at Amgen. We've already reduced gross costs by $700 million, enabling our 2015 adjusted operating margin to grow by some four points. We will make further progress in 2016, and we're expecting another $400 million of gross savings as we expect to reduce adjusted operating expenses year over year. Our transformation has also made us more agile, and you see the benefits of that in our competitive performance across our products. In manufacturing, our teams are significant contributors to our transformation efforts, driving down our cost of sales and making final preparations for the licensure of our next-generation bio-manufacturing facility in Singapore. Improved drug delivery systems are an important differentiator of our medicines, and we're delivering solid results with them. The Neulasta Onpro kit has been extremely successful in the marketplace. And we filed our Repatha once-monthly dosing option globally. We'll continue to innovate with patient and provider-friendly delivery systems to help differentiate our products. We've also remained focused on smart capital allocation. Through a combination of share buybacks, dividends, and value-creating business development activities that are aligned with our overall strategy, we expect to drive shareholder value. We established a set of targeted financial commitments through 2018. These metrics were chosen in part to provide evidence that we are making clear progress on our strategy through a period of patent expiration and new product launches. I'm pleased to report that as we closed 2015, we've made significant progress toward accomplishing these longer-term metrics. And finally, as we enter 2016, our position is strong, our strategy is clear, and we're excited about the year ahead. I'd like to think my Amgen colleagues, many of whom are listening to this call, for their unwavering commitment to deliver for patients and for our shareholders. David, over to you. David W. Meline - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Bob. Turning to the fourth quarter on page five of the slide deck, revenues at $5.5 billion grew 4% year over year, with a 3% increase in product sales. Other revenues at $207 million increased $50 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting an increase in royalty income and a milestone payment recognized in the quarter. Adjusted operating income at $2.4 billion grew 16% from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved five percentage points to 44% for the quarter, reflecting the continued benefits of our transformation program. On an adjusted basis, total operating expenses decreased 4% year over year, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately two percentage points. Cost of sales margin at 14.3% improved by 1.6 percentage points, driven by lower manufacturing costs, higher net selling price, and lower royalties. Research and development expenses at $1.1 billion were down 10% year over year, reflecting the Q4 2014 upfront payment to Kite Pharma of $60 million for our cancer immunotherapy collaboration, as well as the benefit of R&D expense savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. SG&A expenses were up 3% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting incremental expenses in Q4 for new product launches, partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. Other income and expenses improved by $53 million year over year to a net expense of $120 million in the quarter, primarily due to cash investment portfolio activities as well as higher interest income due to higher cash balances this year. The tax rate was 11.6% for the quarter, a 1.4 percentage point increase versus Q4 of 2014. This increase was primarily due to a decreased benefit from the R&D tax credit in 2015 versus 2014 due to higher pre-tax income and reduced R&D expenses. As a result, adjusted net income increased 19% and adjusted earnings per share increased 21%. You will find a summary of our full-year 2015 results on page six of the presentation. Our 2015 full-year revenues grew 8% to $21.7 billion, and adjusted earnings per share grew 19% to $10.38 per share. For the full year, adjusted operating income grew to $10.1 billion, a 19% increase, based on the combination of solid revenue growth along with flat operating expenses. Operating margin improved by four percentage points to 48%. On an adjusted basis, cost of sales margin improved by 1.3 percentage points year over year to 14.5%, driven by lower royalties, higher net selling price, and lower manufacturing costs. Research and development expenses decreased 5%, driven by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. And SG&A expenses were up 6%, primarily due to increased commercial expenses for new product launches, partially offset by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. Other income and expenses improved by $114 million year over year, primarily due to higher interest income due to higher cash balances, partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher debt balances. The tax rate was 16.8% for the full year, up 1.9 percentage points versus 2014. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page seven, for the full year 2015 we generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow versus $7.8 billion last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales and profitability. As a result of this strong cash flow performance, total cash and investments increased to $31.4 billion. This balance included over $2 billion in the U.S. and $29 billion outside the U.S. Total debt outstanding increased slightly to $31.6 billion. As a result, net debt decreased by $3.5 billion to $200 million at year end 2015. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and an average maturity of 10 years. Additionally, for 2015, we increased our dividend per share by 30% to $0.79 per quarter, with payments totaling $2.4 billion. We also announced a 27% increase to the dividend to $1.00 per share for our first quarter 2016 payment. Finally, at our 2014 business review, we indicated the intent to repurchase shares totaling up to $2 billion by the end of 2015, which we have now accomplished with repurchases of approximately 13 million shares since Q4 of 2014. At the end of 2015 we had approximately $4.9 billion remaining under our board-authorized share repurchase program. We intend to repurchase an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of shares in 2016 and are on track to deliver our capital allocation commitments to shareholders. I will now turn to guidance for 2016, summarized on page eight. As you will recall, we provided preliminary 2016 guidance on our October earnings call. Today we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects an improved revenue outlook, due to revised timing of new biosimilar competition, as well as the inclusion of the R&D tax credit, which has been permanently extended. With this background our 2016 revenue guidance is $22 billion to $22.5 billion versus prior guidance of $21.7 billion to $22.3 billion. And our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $10.60 to $11 per share. In addition, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to improve by one percentage point versus prior guidance, 19.5% to 20.5%. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year. As a result of our strong progress in 2015 and the 2016 outlook, we remain confident we will meet or exceed commitments provided for the 2014 to 2018 period, including double-digit adjusted EPS growth, adjusted operating margin improvement from 38% to 52% to 54%, $1.5 billion of transformation savings with a net $800 million reduction in operating expense, and return to shareholders of at least 60% of adjusted net income during the period. We also previously guided for total restructuring expense related to the transformation program of $935 million to $1.035 billion during the period through 2018. Based on better than anticipated results from the exit of two of our closed facilities, we now expect to incur a total of $800 million to $900 million in restructuring expense through 2018, with nearly $700 million recognized already in 2014 and 2015. In summary, we delivered another year of strong financial results in 2015, and we are increasingly confident in the outlook for Amgen's success in 2016 and beyond. This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the fourth quarter on slide number 10. Globally, product sales grew 3% year over year for the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. Our U.S. business delivered 5% year-over-year growth in the quarter and 12% for the full year. The fourth quarter included the negative $100 million impact related to the large quarter three end customer purchases that I described in our last earnings call. Foreign exchange negatively impacted year-over-year sales by two percentage points in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, our international business was up 5% year over year for the fourth quarter and up 6% for the full year. By any measure 2015 was a success from an operating and execution standpoint. Our growth products led the way, as they continued with meaningful growth. We also laid the foundation for future success with our new product launches, as well as further expansion into new countries, while transforming our customer-facing model and delivering significant cost savings, which we reinvested in the launches. Let me now start with an update on our new cardiovascular franchise, where we had two launches in 2015, Repatha of course being the biggest opportunity. Repatha is off to a strong competitive start. In the U.S. Repatha's relative share of the segment is reflective in my mind of our launch preparations and execution in the field. Brand recognition amongst cardiologists and primary care physicians is strong. And Repatha's single dose delivering intensive and predictable LDLC level reductions is resonating well with prescribers. We've made good progress with our payer negotiations. More than 80% of commercial lives currently have access to Repatha. But strict payer utilization management criteria are limiting the uptake, as you see in the IMS scripts. We continue to work with payers on evaluating the utilization management criteria to ensure that appropriate patients are able to receive Repatha through their plans. In Europe, reimbursement negotiations are ongoing, and we expect to add reimbursement in many countries over the course of the year. I'm pleased to report that earlier this month we secured national reimbursement in Spain, well ahead of expectations. In Japan Repatha was approved last week. And along with our partner, Astellas, we are looking forward to launching the product in the next few months after securing reimbursement. Sean will discuss our coronary imaging and cardiovascular outcomes study shortly. And we look forward to data from these two trials strengthening Repatha's profile. Also in cardiovascular disease, our innovative heart failure medicine, Corlanor, is making steady progress with prescribers after its launch early in 2015. Let me now move to oncology, starting with our other large new opportunity, Kyprolis. Kyprolis grew 63% year over year and 8% sequentially. Our chart orders indicate that we have more than doubled KRd patient share in new-to-treatment second-line patients since our label expansion in July, based on the ASPIRE data. We're very excited too about the recent FDA approval to add ENDEAVOR data to our U.S. label, demonstrating that Kyprolis doubled progression-free survival versus Velcade. Our teams are trained and in the marketplace the day after the ENDEAVOR approval. With both the ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data now in our U.S. label, we have strengthened Kyprolis's profile as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. Kyprolis is now the only approved therapy for relapsed multiple myeloma, with proven efficacy as a single agent, doublet, or triplet combination, with different doses to meet individual patient needs. Sales will continue to grow as we treat more second-line patients, and they stay on therapy longer, driven by the deep and durable responses to Kyprolis. In Europe Kyprolis was approved in November for second-line therapy based on the ASPIRE data. We are launching across Europe on a country-by-country basis, as reimbursement is secured. It is already reimbursed in Germany, and the launch there is underway. Continuing now with oncology, XGEVA grew 10% year over year in the fourth quarter and delivered $1.4 billion in sales for the year, driven by unit share gains in both the U.S. and Europe. The fourth quarter was negatively impacted by some large purchases in the third quarter. We continue to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition. Vectibix grew 2% year over year, but had a 10% unit growth. With over 60% of Vectibix sales outside the U.S., foreign exchange negatively impacted Vectibix growth by about seven percentage points. Nplate continued solid growth of about 15% year over year, driven by 17% unit growth. Turning now to the filgrastim franchise, the launch of the Neulasta Onpro kit continued its strong momentum, achieving 24% share of all Neulasta sales in the fourth quarter. This innovative delivery system is applied during a patient's chemotherapy visit, so they can avoid returning to the doctor the next day, as this is the normal requirement for Neulasta injection. This will also be an important differentiator versus future long-acting filgrastim by some of the competition. Quarter over quarter, Neulasta was negatively impacted by the burn-off of some larger U.S. customer purchases in the third quarter that we described on our last call. We expect Neulasta to grow modestly in 2016, as we don't expect a biosimilar launch in the U.S. until the end of the year at the earliest. NEUPOGEN declined 4% year over year. Sequentially it lost three points of market share in the U.S., split between the biosimilar and the branded competitors, but still retains 76% share. Share loss over the last year resulted in an 11% unit decline in the U.S., but the U.S. sales also benefited from a revision to accounting estimates in quarter four. As I said previously, we will compete account by account using our many years of experience competing against biosimilars in Europe and branded competitors globally, but do expect some share loss. We launched two other medicines in oncology : BLINCYTO, which continues to make inroads with ALL patients; and IMLYGIC, where we are pleased with the initial response in key institutions with met (24:05) indication as well as its future potential in combination with other immunotherapies. Let me now turn to inflammation with ENBREL. On slide number 19, you'll see that ENBREL grew 8% year over year, driven by net selling price. You'll recall, net selling price includes the impact from list price changes as well as contracting and access changes that have occurred over the past 12 months. Year over year, segment growth remained strong, as rheumatology grew 27% and dermatology grew 46% on a value basis. Quarter on quarter, our rheumatology value share was stable at 28%, while our share in dermatology declined two percentage points to 22% due to intensifying competition from new therapies. I'll remind you that rheumatology accounts for about 80% of ENBREL sales. Given ENBREL's exclusivity through 2029, we continue to invest in the brand, and its outlook for further growth remains strong. I'll now move to bone health and Prolia. Prolia grew 21% year over year in the fourth quarter, with about 20% unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe, delivering $1.3 billion of sales for the year. Growth was driven by continued share gains in both the U.S. and Europe, and we expect this momentum to continue in 2016. With our recent agreement with GSK, we look forward to transitioning Prolia as well as XGEVA and Vectibix back under Amgen's control in 48 countries and continuing to drive growth. This is another important step in delivering our international expansion strategy. We're also looking forward to a potential important addition to our bone health franchise with romosozumab, which will soon have its Phase 3 data and Sean will be discussing in a moment. Turning now to our nephrology franchise, starting with EPOGEN; EPOGEN declined 37% year over year, driven by a shift in ESA use. This decline has three primary components. First, around 30% of the decline is due to the shift from EPOGEN to Aranesp in the dialysis setting. We continue to see uptake of Aranesp with medium-sized and independent dialysis centers. Second, roughly 20% is a result of the burn-off from a large customer purchase in quarter three, as we discussed on our last call. The remaining 50% of the decline comes from the shift from Mircera at Fresenius. Fresenius represents about a third of the U.S. dialysis business. In October, they disclosed that just over half of their dialysis patients utilizing ESAs had switched to Mircera. EPOGEN sales in 2016 are likely to be impacted by further share declines at Fresenius and the potential for additional switching to Aranesp. Just a reminder that we have a very good business partnership with DaVita, and our agreement with them extends through 2018 to purchase at least 90% of their ESAs from Amgen. Aranesp sales increased 4% year over year, with a 25% unit growth in the U.S., driven by continued shift in dialysis business from EPOGEN to Aranesp. International sales were negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates. Sensipar grew 21% year over year for the fourth quarter and delivered $1.4 billion in sales for the year, driven by net selling price and unit growth in both the U.S. and Europe, with good growth prospects for 2016. Our nephrology franchise has another exciting opportunity with Parsabiv, the new trade name for etelcalcetide, an intravenous calcimimetic, currently under regulatory review in both the U.S. and Europe. I would like to close by outlining our expectations for 2016. We do not expect Neulasta or EPOGEN biosimilars in the U.S. until the end of 2016 at the earliest, assuming potential competitors provide us 180 days' notice between approval and launch. EPOGEN is likely to face continued competition at Fresenius and the conversion to Aranesp. EPOGEN continues to face headwinds with new competition, while we expect Neulasta sales to continue to grow given the assumed delay of the U.S. biosimilar competition. We expect ENBREL, Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix, and Nplate will all see continued growth in 2016. And our recently launched products, notably Repatha and Kyprolis, will continue with meaningful growth in 2016. Kyprolis's improved label in the U.S. coupled with our launches around the world will continue to drive solid growth. Repatha growth is expected to be steady in the near term, with breakaway potential once we have the outcomes data in our label. It sure has been a busy and very exciting time for our teams across the world, and I'd like to thank them for their hard work and dedication to delivering for patients. Let me now pass it to Sean. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. 2015 was an unprecedented year for Amgen with a record number of regulatory submissions and approvals, and 2016 promises to be another very busy year. We've already announced two regulatory approvals, and there are a lot more R&D events to come. Beginning with our cardiovascular franchise, last week Repatha was approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and patients who are at high risk for cardiovascular events who are not adequately responding to statins. This is the first approval of a PCSK9 inhibitor in Japan and the very first approval by our joint venture, Amgen Astellas Biopharma. I'm also happy to report that our outcomes study remains on track, as we continue to expect the data in the second half of this year along with the results of our coronary imaging study we're conducting with the Cleveland Clinic. We believe that demonstrating a reduction in plaque burn with Repatha will resonate with cardiologists and complement the outcomes data. We've also been reviewing in detail along with our partners at Cytokinetics and Servier the Phase 2 data for omecamtiv mecarbil, our novel myosin activator for heart failure. We've been extremely encouraged by the feedback we've received from our discussions with experts in the field as we prepare to meet with regulators to discuss a potential path forward. Turning to oncology, last week in the U.S. we also received a new indication for Kyprolis in combination with dexamethasone in the relapsed multiple myeloma setting. This was based on the ENDEAVOR data, which demonstrated clear superiority over Velcade, as Kyprolis doubled the amount progression-free survival time. This FDA decision also converted the initial accelerated approval to full approval and added important dosing flexibility. The Kyprolis ENDEAVOR data are currently under review in the EU. Subgroup analyses of ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR were presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting last month, and the response from physicians reinforced our view that Kyprolis will be a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy as physicians pursue deeper, more durable responses for their patients in search of cure. In support of this, we're exploring the use of Kyprolis in combination with newer therapies for multiple myeloma and announced an initial agreement late last year in which we are providing drugs to Janssen for combination study with daratumumab. In the fourth quarter, we also received three marketing authorizations in Europe, including Kyprolis in combination with Revlimid plus dexamethasone for relapsed multiple myeloma based on the ASPIRE data. IMLYGIC was approved for the treatment of adults with unresectable melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic with no bone, brain, or other visceral disease. And BLINCYTO was approved for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We recently conducted an analysis of the events occurring in our large ongoing Phase 3 trial of XGEVA in the setting of skeletal-related events prevention in multiple myeloma patients. And with the usual caveat that this is an event-driven trial, we currently estimate we'll see the data toward the end of this year. We also continue to expand our immuno-oncology platform and announced new collaborations with Merck combining their PD-1 inhibitor with BLINCYTO in the setting of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; and AMG 820, our anti-colony-stimulating factor one receptor antibody in advanced solid tumors. Finally, in oncology, our Phase 1 study of AMG 330, our anti-CD33 BiTE, continues to enroll acute myeloid leukemia patients. In the area of bone health, we along with our partners at UCB are awaiting the results from our registrational Phase 3 study of our sclerostin antibody, romosozumab, for post-menopausal osteoporosis. We expect these data this quarter. In this study, we are assessing the effect of romosozumab dosed monthly for 12 months compared to placebo dosed for 12 months, after which both cohorts are treated with Prolia for 12 months. The co-primary endpoints are the incidence of vertebral fracture at 12 and 24 months. And important secondary endpoints include clinical and non-vertebral fractures. We're also conducting a Phase 3 study of similar design comparing romosozumab to alendronate in year one, followed by both cohorts being treated with alendronate in year two. We expect romosozumab to be used in high-risk osteoporosis patients. And with a total of 12 monthly doses, we believe the most effective way to ensure proper dosing and maximum benefit in this patient population, at least initially, is through administration by a healthcare provider. We'll continue to evaluate the development of potential indications, formulations, and delivery options that could be attractive for certain patient populations. In fact, we will be seeing data from a Phase 3 study assessing the improvement in bone marrow density in men with osteoporosis in the first half of this year. While osteoporosis and osteoporosis-related fractures are more commonly associated with postmenopausal women, as many as one in four men over the age of 50 will suffer a fragility fracture in their remaining lifetimes. Before I leave our bone franchise, I'd point out that we'll also be receiving data from a Phase 3 Prolia study in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Millions of patients are on glucocorticoid therapy around the world, which can result in significant bone loss and fracture. In neuroscience, our Phase 3 study in episodic migraine with our CGRP receptor antibody, AMG 334, continues to enroll extremely well across two studies, a testament to the unmet need and desire by patients for an effective prophylactic therapy. In the chronic migraine setting, our Phase 2b study is expected to read out in the second half of this year. Meanwhile, the Phase 1 study of our anti-PAC-1 antibody for migraine, AMG 301, is currently enrolling patients. And finally, we received a target action date from the FDA on ABP 501, our biosimilar Humira, on September 25 of this year. As I said at the outset, 2015 was a very productive year and we have a lot in store for 2016. I would like to thank all of my colleagues at Amgen for continuing to deliver for patients. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, thank you, Sean. Jake, we're ready now for questions. So if you could just remind our callers of the procedures, we'll open up the lines. Operator : And your first question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, maybe if I could just start with one for Sean. On romo [romosozumab], people are obviously focused on this data and focused on the potential safety of that molecule. Could you just address for us how you think about the potential for some imbalances and falls or hearing loss or some of the brain volume growth that obviously make people worried about neurological symptoms? And then in addition to that, just talk about, to the extent you can, what the DSMB has looked for, what sort of monitoring you have, and the study around those issues. Thanks. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Yes, so I think obviously when one looks, this is a genetically validated target, and when one looks at the rare familial forms of absence of sclerostin or partial absence of sclerostin activity such as van Buchem's disease or sclerosteosis, these individuals from conception are deficient in sclerostin. And so as a consequence of course, over time, often in their third or fourth decade, they begin to have some untoward effects from this, such as very thick skull plates and the foramina in which cranial nerves that exit from the skull can impinge on the nerves due to overgrowth of bone. I think that this is something that is an effect developing from conception with the absence of sclerostin. And I just would contrast it sharply with giving one year of therapy to generally quite elderly, at least middle-aged at minimum, osteoporotic patients. So I think of course in an abundance of caution, we are doing testing on hearing and some other things that are designed to assess these kind of theoretical risks. But I would certainly be very surprised to see a pharmacodynamic response from the drug that would result in those kind of complications. The DSMB, of course, is fully aware, as all our investigators are out doing the trials, and patients through informed consent that all of the theoretical and established potential risks of these kinds of investigative products. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC: Maybe for Tony on Repatha's uptake, you noted the happiness on your part with the share gains. But are you disappointed overall with the size of the pie at this stage? I know you're seeing reimbursement headwinds. But nonetheless, I guess is this on a more shallow trajectory than you thought? And assuming we do get the positive outcomes data toward the second half of the year, should we see an immediate benefit from that, or would you think it would still take some time to work with payers to work through these headwinds? Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Thanks, Eric. So I'm glad you see the relative performance in the marketplace. The hub we put together was clearly done because we understood there was going to be a little bit of time before the payers made a decision around formulary approval. And to me, the hub has therefore been a surrogate to the level of prescriptions that cardiologists and endos and primary care physicians are prepared to prescribe. We are seeing a really robust level of prescriptions coming through the hub. So to me, that continues to give me great confidence in terms of physician willingness to prescribe this drug for patients who fit inside the label. The prescriptions themselves in terms of both the NBRxs and the TRxs are continuing. It's clear that the utilization management criteria in place is restricting the number of prescriptions that get dispensed. And we are working with payers at the moment to make sure that patients who are eligible actually get access to these drugs. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Then on the outcomes study. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : So the outcomes study, clearly I think one thing that's clear what the value of this drug is, physicians, patients, and payers will realize a tremendous amount of value. Now I think there will be a time between the data becoming present and the data moving into the label that we'll be negotiating with payer by payer. But once it's in the label, it's clear that we should see some dramatic uptake then, yes. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Jake, let's take the next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question, a couple on Repatha as well. So, Tony, when you look at the subtleties, either reimbursement or populations or clinical practice, can you compare the EU and Japanese markets to the U.S., assuming that you do get an outcomes data this year? And then just to follow up to Eric's question on the U.S. market, what can you tell us in terms of leading indicators of demand? In other words, like physician prescribers or visits to your hub or things like that? Just want to get some demand metrics beyond TRx. Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : I think I understand your question about access outside the U.S. So one has to remember that outside the United States, once access is granted, physicians are not making a decision on anything other than a clinical decision around the value for patients. So there is no economic decision once you have access in Europe and in Japan. So the negotiation is to get access as quickly as possible, and then to move patients onto the drug as physicians prescribe. From an inside the U.S. perspective, yeah, it's the number of prescriptions we're seeing across the range of physicians who have been prescribing it is encouraging. And I'm not quite sure what more you want to hear about it, Geoff, sorry. Did I answer your question? Or did I miss a question there? Operator : And your next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah, hang on, Jake. Before you move on to Alethia, Tony was asking if he had addressed Geoff's question. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Geoff, was that okay? Was there anything else? Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay, looks like we might have lost him, so let's go on with the next question from Alethia. Alethia, go ahead. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Alethia, we can hear you. Go ahead. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): On NEUPOGEN, I know you said you were going to compete account by account. And so far you have share \u2013 you still have 76% share. But can you give us a little flavor on the progress that you've done there? Have you spoken to the majority of accounts? Just help us think about how much defense you're playing and how much success you're having. And then on Neulasta, I guess I wanted to think about \u2013 with the Onpro device, do you think that business is now sticky? And we should think about that as share that's now protected if there were a biosimilar to emerge in 2017? Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Okay. So NEUPOGEN, tough to answer your question. We clearly segment the NEUPOGEN account between large, medium, and small. And we decide which ones we're going to defend and which ones we're going to be letting go. As you know we've had competition on the market for over a year now plus a biosimilar competitor for close to six months. And we still hold 76% of the market share. As regard to the on-body injector for Neulasta, the main reason we brought it to market is the unique distinctive value this drug \u2013 or that this device brings to patients and to the physicians and clinics and institutions. Most patients try and get their chemo on a Friday; then they can spend the weekend recovering before they go back to work. Neulasta requires them to come back on a Saturday morning to get their last injection. So sometimes what was happening is patients were getting the injections too early, which is actually not good. It actually reduces the effectiveness of the drug quite dramatically. Or two, they were not coming back for the injection at all, so exposing themselves to potential febrile neutropenia. So the real value that we've picked up from patients, from nurses, from physicians, and from institutions has been we are increasing the opportunity to give patients the right number of cycles at the right time and really reduce the possibility of febrile neutropenia dramatically. This is the benefit we sell the device on consistently, which I'm sure will continue and stick. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I was wondering, you talked about the label expansions and some of the benefit there. But I was just wondering if you could comment on the potential future contribution from once-weekly dosing? Is that really one of the key drivers of an inflection here? And then any commentary you can provide on average treatment duration trends for Kyprolis? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : So I think with Kyprolis, we have to start with our true belief that driving deep remission is where clinical practice is going to go. And the combinations using Kyprolis as one of the products in the backbone is clearly showing us these huge extended periods of PFS, which by definition is helping us drive deep remission. Patient convenience down the line will become important. And I think the once a week dose will certainly help with patient convenience to ensure that patients stay on the drug for as long as we can. As regards to duration, when we look at the chart orders, we see that products in this category in second line are probably being used between about seven months to eight months at the moment. It's difficult to quote Kyprolis data yet, because we only got approval for the second line in July. So we're hoping to see some extended data in the next couple of quarters. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS. Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thanks very much for taking my question. I want to go back to romosozumab. Just wanted a little bit more from the commercial side, because if the trial works, we're all going to be interested in the opportunity for the product. So to that end, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the strategy to at least initially administer the drug in the doc offices by a healthcare provider. Can you just talk about why you think that's beneficial for the patient? And whether or not you think that that's the best way to maximize the potential to impact patients? And then I guess a related follow-on to that would be, can you talk about what work you're doing to maybe provide a self-injection option down the line? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : So let's start with Prolia because we've spent the last four or five years now building a level of expertise on Prolia. And we were the first biologic, injectable biologic to launch into a GP-type market, a complex process which I think the team have got their hands around. And as you see the data in the U.S., Prolia continues to grow in leaps and bounds as we get both breadth and depth of prescribing happening. It's clear to us that a lot of these patients are elderly, and coming back to the doctor is important to ensure they get the injection. When I think about any other potential competition to romo, the biggest complaint they have is the difficulty of daily injections, of course. So we do see that the same targets that are prescribing Prolia would be targeted to go to, to talk about romo. And we think that the large unmet opportunity in the marketplace, this is quite a large opportunity for us to go to market with. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Do you want to say anything about future plans on administration? Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : We are always looking to advance and improve on the way we actually bring to market a combination device product, and we will continue to look at effective and efficient ways for those patients who decide that self-injection could be an option, yes. Operator : And your next question comes from line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets. Michael J. Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. I had a question for Sean regarding romo. I think that certainly we think that should work, but I actually wanted to ask scientifically. Could you remind us how confident you are in translating that superior BMD data to superior fracture data, particularly against a high-efficacy drug like Forteo, if similar or to what magnitude it could be much better numerically? And then in year two \u2013 I know you're testing the hypothesis of that design in your study. But what would you expect in year two? And is there any reason that it would not be maintained across year two? Thanks. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: What I would say is that the confidence level we have about the BMD, which as you know is the most impressive BMD increase that's been seen in humans with any treatment, translating that into fracture resistance, that confidence is high. I think that the genetic validation that exists for the pathway is very convincing to people in the field. Also, we saw \u2013 this is one of the few areas where the preclinical models, particularly those performed in non-human primates, are really quite predictive of what you'll see in humans. And then in a non-human primate, we were able to do biomechanical testing of bone, of course, after animals are sacrificed. And so we know that we achieved extremely high bone strength in these animals commensurate with the BMD increases. And finally, we've done very advanced imaging of humans that have been treated with romosozumab and compared it head to head to what we see with Forteo. And as you probably know, Forteo has its major impact on trabecular bone and has a relatively limited impact on cortical bone. And cortical bone really is what matters for the majority of long bone fracture risk, which is really where the clinical need is. And so we have multiple reasons to believe the genetics, the preclinical information, and the imaging that we've done in humans that we should have only not only a greater BMD increase, but that the quality of the bone that we're producing is of a higher quality than what one gets using PTH analogues. One way of thinking about this is there really are two master regulatory switches for controlling BMD. One of them is RANK Ligand, which controls osteoclast function that we direct in us met (52:27) there. And the other is sclerostin, which controls osteoblast function, and there sclerostin is the key mediator. So what you're doing here like with romosozumab is throwing a master physiologic regulatory switch. And so what you're expecting to get and what we see in everything that we've observed is physiologic high-quality bone formation. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Can you talk about year two, Sean? Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Year two, I think the thing that is interesting here in this paradigm is that this is a one-year treatment. And so the first year of the study is very important because it's a placebo-controlled period. We know from our experience with humans that we can't just withdraw the product and leave patients on no therapy, so the gains that are so impressive will melt away relatively quickly. And so it is necessary to lock in these gains with an antiresorptive agent. So what we expect to see is \u2013 we obviously know a lot about Prolia. We expect the placebo group to respond well to Prolia in the second year, but the patients on romosozumab will also get substantial benefit. And so if there's a meaningful difference in fracture risk at the end of year one, that should persist more or less out to the second year and even in theory well beyond that. But this is a new paradigm in osteoporosis, this relatively short period. And the study designs are quite different than what people are used to seeing in the field, so we'll all be fascinated to see the results obviously. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Jake, before you go on to the next question, Tony had an additional comment on Geoff Meacham's question about the Repatha demand indicators. Tony? Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Sure. So, Geoff, I think I better understand your question now, more around in addition to TRx's, what else should we be looking at to see future growth in the marketplace. Like always, to me TRx's and MDRx's in terms of new naive patients are the most important thing to measuring in terms of the growth. But with a new launch like this where the plans are put into place at the formularies, one has to remember that IMS only reports dispensed prescriptions; i.e., prescriptions that come to a pharmacy or a specialty pharmacy and the patient actually walks away with the drug. What you have to be able to look at inside that data is how many prescriptions get to the pharmacy and how many are rejected versus how many are abandoned. So we are seeing that the majority of prescriptions getting to the pharmacy at the moment are being rejected, rejected because the prior authorization process has not been properly completed or there's some outstanding information and patients have to go back and get some more data. All patients are seeing the copay at this particular stage because the product is not properly on formulary yet as being too high a copay, and they abandon the prescription and they walk away. So the data you're seeing is really important, but you have to understand that the majority of prescriptions getting to the pharmacy are either being rejected or abandoned at the moment while the plans complete their process, which is why we spent so much time with the plans at the moment showing them the number of eligible patients who are on label getting to pharmacy and not getting product. It really is a concern. And when you think about the potential Repatha patient, these are patients that are at risk right now for a cardiac event and therefore early intervention is essential, so we're spending quite a bit of urgent with the payers. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Tony. Jake, let's take the next question, please. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Schimmer from Piper Jaffray. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to come back to the Repatha management criteria that are limiting uptake. Can you elaborate a little bit on what the primary causes for rejection are? Give us any sense as to the evidence that you are making progress in addressing some of these issues. And then given what those issues are, what gives you the confidence that the cardiovascular trial data may ultimately resolve that as a barrier? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : So it's Tony here, Josh. Utilization management criteria obviously differ plan by plan, but they include things such as patient must restate naturally tolerated statin dose or someone requires you to be on one or two statins. Some of them require you to have done statins plus a step-through to Zetia. There's clearly a requirement around your LDLC level, they have to be at a certain level. But probably the more complex thing is the prior authorization documents. There are five pages of handwritten stuff that physicians have to find out about. And most of the rejections are because the form is not properly completed, and this is the time to collect the data. So as we get the process running a bit more efficiently and hopefully moving from paper to an electronic process, the prior authorizations could go faster. And then as we show the payers the impact of too draconian a utilization management criteria not getting to the right patients, we will see some changes there. The outcomes data of course will dramatically change the value of this particular drug, and we do expect to see some changes in the utilization criteria once we have that turn. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question, three questions. First, I'd like to know where Arvind buys his ties. Second question is Pfizer has made the decision to enroll primary prevention patients I believe into their Phase 3 PCSK9 outcomes trial, Sean and Tony, and I was wondering. They expect to have a label indication for that, and they believe that that's very important for the payers. Why did you make the decision not to design your trial that way? Maybe that's a Sean question. And for Tony, what commercial implications, if any, is this going to have in your mind? And then third, just to follow up on someone else's question, just to be more direct, I think what's going on, on the Street right now is people are concerned that the romo fracture reduction magnitude may look optically less than what is contained, for example, in the Forteo label or some of the data that Radius has produced for the PTH analogue, primarily because at two years you're comparing obviously your sclerostin antibody to an active comparator versus these other agents which were compared to placebo I believe. So the question is should we be expecting, Sean, can you just talk about, is this an apples-to-apples comparison or apples-to-oranges comparison when we actually see that number? Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sean, why don't you do romo and the Pfizer PCSK9 question, and then Tony can do part of it. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Okay. So with respect to room, what I would say is that you're right that this will not be so straightforward as to make cross-trial comparisons of those sort. They're fraught with difficulty always, these Santa Claus trial comparisons. But in osteoporosis, because the trials are very large and of very similar design, in general people have felt pretty comfortable doing that. and you've seen that, for example, when we had our three-year fracture data for Prolia, people compared it to three-year fracture data with bisphosphonate, either oral or IV, et cetera. And I think in this case it's going to be much more difficult to make those kind of simple comparisons. I think what will happen here is that the data will be interpreted by the experts in the field. And as always is the case with a specialty product like this that's targeted at a very specific patient population, the experts in the field will make the determination whether they think that the data are impressive and who ought to be getting the product, and that will influence prescribing outside the expert community. With respect to the primary versus secondary prevention strategies, I think that the companies that were in the lead on PCSK9 wanted to get outcomes data for these products as fast as was possible. And the fastest way to get the outcomes data is to study a patient population that has a fairly high event rate, and that generally is achieved \u2013 or one of the main levers you can pull is to have patients who have suffered a prior event. That's one of the strongest predictors of a subsequent event. As you know, there have been slightly different flavor variants on that that have been pursued by us and by Regeneron, but that's been the basic approach. Moreover, it's never been necessary in this field to do outcomes trials in various different populations in order to have a label the covers broad patient populations. So what you really need to do is demonstrate convincingly that the LDL level reductions that you're achieving with your agent translate unequivocally into reductions in cardiovascular outcome risk. That's all you need to do. And we feel that the studies will do that. Obviously, a company coming behind, it has to think about what they're going to do to try to differentiate their position. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : So I think that the payers will be looking at high-risk patients. Physicians will be making decisions around patients to prescribe that have a high risk. And I think the clinical trials we have will take into account all patients that are high-risk. Clearly those who have an event or have concomitant disabilities will be a higher chance of getting a drug and getting it prescribed. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Jake, let's take the next question. Operator : And your next question comes from the line Eun Yang from Jefferies. Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. So when you look at Forteo sales, ex-U.S. sales are higher than U.S. sales despite limit of aggressive price increases. But when you look at Prolia, U.S. sales account for 64% of total sales. Why do you think that there is a difference in usage between anabolic and entire result of Asia, or so you think this is due to several of the administration versus efficiency of the administration (1:03:40)? And the follow-on, that is romosozumab is going to be used one-year treatment whereas the PTA channels are going to be used two-year in use, countries is two years. So how do you think about the pricing of romosozumab? Thank you. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Let me try and answer the first piece about the difference in the sales globally. I think Prolia was simply a timing around coming to market. We came to market during a fiscal crisis, and the entire reimbursement process outside the United States took a number of years. In fact, in France it took us 4.5 years from approval to get the final decision made on pricing. So outside the U.S. they are running to catch up in terms of the patient usage. And then we are sure that eventually we should get to a decent balance. Sean? Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think the other question... Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Another question had to do with pricing. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Pricing, value, Tony? Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: I imagine it's premature. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : I think the price we'll be able to charge will be clearly linked around the value proposition we see coming out of the clinical trials. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay, Jake, let's take the next question please. Operator : And your next question from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to Kyprolis for a minute, and just wondering if you have an efficacy interim look built into CLARION similar to what you had for ENDEAVOR? And if you do, what triggers it? And what kind of action can be taken? Would it just be \u2013 it could be stopped for either futility or overwhelming efficacy? Thanks. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Yeah. So these trials were all designed more or less at the same time by the same group of people. And they all have a generally similar design in that they have interim analyses. Obviously, that interim analysis has in it the ability to stop the trial for clear futility and to stop the trial for overwhelming efficacy. And if you, I'm sure will recall, both ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR were stopped for overwhelming efficacy. I think this is a reasonable design. But I don't think that we are in any way planning on seeing a first-line study stopped for overwhelming efficacy at the interim, but it is a possibility. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : As we said, Cory, we're expecting this in 2017. Okay, let's go to the next question. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from BofA Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. If you don't mind, can you spell out the sales of Repatha last quarter? I know it's a small number, but just a housekeeping question there. And then secondly on romosozumab regulatory path, do you believe firmly that the first Phase 3 trial that would read out in 1Q this year should be sufficient for FDA approval? Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sorry. Did you get the second question, Sean? Okay, why don't you go ahead in the second question? Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Yes, on the romo study, yes, we believe based on the published guidances by regulators around the world and our interactions with the regulators around the world that if successful, the placebo-controlled study we were just talking about earlier, the first of these studies that reads out, will be sufficient for global registration. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. And as to the Repatha sales, you're right, we're not breaking those out by line item at this time. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Jake, let's go ahead and move on to the next question, please. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney from Robert W. Baird. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just thinking a little bit more about the outcomes data for Repatha expected later this year, where do you think the range of outcomes can fall in terms of how we extrapolate the reduction in LDL capability of the drug to what we've classically seen in terms of CV reduction? And kind of maybe think about what the range should be based on that? And how it could deviate from that classical extrapolation, whether it's due to different types of patients or just the trial design? How we can think about that? Thanks. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Yeah. I mean this is the kind of subject than one can sit around and talk about for many, many hours with experts, which I've done. And I think the best thing I can say is that we have a remarkably linear relationship that we've established, most recently with IMPROVE-IT, extending that line in just a remarkably linear fashion. Extending the line that was created by statins and by other interventions, such as ileal bypass surgery and so on, and the genetics of course. And so when you put it all together, what you have to believe scientifically is that what the truth is, that you're going to fall right on that line in the same way as if you achieved that additional LDL lowering with a statin or with ezetimibe, were that possible. Obviously it's not. Could it deviate from the line? Sure. I mean it is always possible that some of the foibles of the way that the clinical trials are designed and conducted \u2013 there is of course, for example, a treatment lag of some sort that occurs when you start therapies. And so when the study reads out very quickly instead of over a longer period of time, that has a bigger influence, et cetera, that could make it come off the line slightly in one direction. We also know that the agent does have some activities that statins don't have. For example, there is an effect on Lp(a), which is present in some individuals and seems to be a strong prognostic factor that could make the dot come off the line a little bit the other direction. So there's some variability that you could expect. But from a scientific perspective, based on the human genetics and everything we know, one would expect that you're going to see a reduction that would be proportional and dissimilar (1:10:26). And that would be roughly this ballpark around the one-third level reduction of the risk. So that's the kind of number that many people \u2013 keep in mind I think the 50% reduction in risk that was suggested by the analyses that were published in The New England Journal, there's a very wide confidence interval around those. And while you can't rule out the possibility that you'll see that big of a reduction, that's a bigger reduction than you would expect to get if you were achieving the LDL lowering that we're achieving with a statin. So it requires some other biology like Lp(a) or something to be going on. And I can't tell you that's not happening, but it sure wouldn't be my base case. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We'll know in a few months, so, okay? Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Lots to talk about today. So we have exceeded our prescribed hour, Jake. Why don't we take two last questions? Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo. Nick Abbott - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon. This is Nick in for Jim this afternoon. We've spent a lot of time talking about the very late-stage pipeline, and clearly you've done a pretty impressive job developing those molecules. But what are you pointing investors to in terms of the early stage? If I look at the Phase 2 pipeline, half of those AMGs are with Astra. There's the CTEPH inhibitor that I guess you're all wondering what to do. And then many of those Phase 1 molecules have been around for a long time. So Phase 3 looks really good, but what about Phase 2 and Phase 1? What should we be focused on? Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: We're actually really excited. I think it's fair that we've had so much going on in the later stages that we haven't spent as much time focusing on talking about what's going on in the earlier pipeline. But we're really excited about quite a number of things in the earlier pipeline. Obviously, omecamtiv mecarbil is very exciting. We have the migraine, new migraine antibody PAC-1 that I mentioned. We have a novel heart failure molecule which will be entering in the clinic this year. That's something that we've developed in-house. We have a completely novel inflammation mechanism that no one else is pursuing that I think is extremely interesting that's entering Phase 1 now. And we have quite a range of bites (1:12:57) targets that are moving forward into the clinic either now or in the relatively near future. So I think there's plenty to look forward to in that space. And we also have earlier than that really the most exciting stuff, which is some of the targets that we believe we are uniquely working on because they've arisen from our advanced population-based human genetic efforts like this sort of Gene X example that some of you may recall from our business review, which is moving along very nicely. So I think in a future business review type setting we'll probably talk a little bit more. It's been hard to do that with everything that's been going on in the late-stage work. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Jake, let's take one last question, please. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time, sir. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay, great. In that case, let me thank everybody for your participation in our call. Between myself and my team, we'll be around for a while. So if there are any other questions, feel free to call us. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Amgen's fourth quarter and financial results conference call.

LLC Operator : My name is Jade, and I'll be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's first quarter 2016 financial results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit to asking one question during the Q&A session. I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Jade. Good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to actually begin by extending my gratitude to all of you for having to deal with the deluge of earnings reports from multiple companies reporting today. I appreciate you being on our conference call to review our operating performance for the first quarter of 2016. We are off to a great start for the year. And to review our progress, Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO, will lead the call with a strategic overview. Our CFO, David Meline, will then review our quarterly results and update you on our guidance for 2016. Tony Hooper, our Head of Global Commercial Operations, is here to discuss our product performance during the quarter; followed by our head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement which in summary says that through the course of our presentation and discussion today we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and let me also thank our listeners for joining the call. As Arvind said, we're off to a strong start in 2016 with 10% revenue growth and 17% adjusted earnings per share growth in the first quarter. Our sales were strong in the U.S. and internationally, and that was true broadly across our products. As you can see from these results, we've put the company in a strong position to manage competition for our legacy products while investing for growth with our newly-launched and late-stage pipeline products. Last year, as you know, we had six launches in the U.S. We expect these products, and especially Kyprolis and REPATHA to pave the way for our long term growth. We'll talk more about these launches and our priorities for them on this call. If last year was a year of launches in the U.S., this will be a year of launches for us internationally, as we take REPATHA, Kyprolis and our other new products into countries around the world. In total this year, we're expecting on the order of 80 new launches across our countries and products. For example, REPATHA is launching now in Japan, Brazil and multiple countries in Europe, and the early signs are good. Similarly, Kyprolis is off to a strong early start in its first markets in Europe. Our Oncology and Cardiovascular franchises received a lot of visibility last year owing to the flow of data and our product launches in these areas. This year, we expect attention to focus on our other franchises as well, as our pipeline advances with important new opportunities. In bone health, for example, our romosozumab opportunity is coming into focus with positive Phase 3 data. In nephrology, we expect approval later this year for Parsabiv, a therapeutic for dialysis patients. And we expect pivotal data in neuroscience for our migraine anti-body, AMG 334. In inflammation, we look forward later this year to establishing with the FDA that our adalimumab molecule is indeed bio-similar to Humira. And while I'm speaking about our biosimilars programs, I'd also remind you that we expect to submit our bevacizumab or Avastin biosimilar file to regulators this year and to have Phase 3 data for our trastuzumab or hercepton bio-similar as well. Our transformation efforts are well underway and delivering results. This includes cost savings, which David will discuss, but also improved speed to market and speed in the market. And these attributes are every bit as important as cost savings as we grow our company with new products in new territories and adapt to the changing environment for our industry. Finally, we've designed our capital allocation strategy to deliver value for shareholders through both an attractive return of capital and dividends and buybacks, and vigorous investment for long-term growth. This is an exciting time in the field of biology, with promising clinical opportunities and breakthroughs arising in many of our areas of interest. So with a strong balance sheet and a long-term investment outlook, we will continue to look for the most promising internal and external opportunities to advance. To underscore our prior comments on this topic, our emphasis will be on focus and capital discipline as we do this. Before turning to David, let me just congratulate my colleagues around the world for the quality of their execution and a very strong start to the year. David? David W. Meline - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the first quarter financial results on page six of the slide deck, we are pleased with our strong performance, driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio. Total revenues at $5.5 billion grew 10% year over year. Overall product sales increased 7%, reflecting continued strong performance from our growth products, which more than offset the impact of competition on our legacy products, EPOGEN and NEUPOGEN. Other revenues at $288 million increased $129 million versus the first quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited both from an upfront partner payment for a licensing transaction, representing almost 40% of total other revenue for the quarter, as well as higher Ibrance royalty income. Total revenue and product sales were impacted 1% unfavorably due to foreign exchange changes. Adjusted operating income at $2.9 billion grew 17% from prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved to 54.6% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth and progress from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories. As in prior years, our operating margin will likely be lower in the remaining quarters of the year, driven by the timing of expenses. In 2016, we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of gross efficiency savings from the transformation versus prior year. This enables continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities, while delivering solid profitability. On an adjusted basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales at 13.5%, improved by 1.6 points, driven by manufacturing efficiencies, higher net selling price and lower royalties. Research and development expenses at $858 million were relatively unchanged in the first quarter of 2016 versus last year. SG&A expenses increased 11% on a year-over-year basis, as increased commercial investments in new product launches were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, adjusted operating expenses increased 3% year over year, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately one percentage point. Other income and expenses were relatively flat on a year-over-year basis at $144 million in the quarter, as higher interest income was offset by higher interest expense. The adjusted tax rate was 18.9% for the quarter, a 1.9-point increase versus Q1 of 2015. This increase was primarily due to the unfavorable tax impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings and a state audit settlement in the same quarter of last year. These increases were partially offset by the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, a new accounting standard that impacts how certain share-based compensation tax expense is recognized. These impacts were previously reported on the balance sheet as a change in shareholders' equity. The new rule requires these impacts to be recognized in the income statement and thus have a tax rate impact. Future tax rate impacts will depend on the movement in our stock price between when we grant share-based compensation and when it vests. The Q1 benefit of this change adds approximately $0.09 to our adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted net income increased 15% and adjusted earnings per share increased 17% year over year. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page seven, free cash flow was $1.8 billion, an increase of $400 million over last year. We deployed $0.7 billion to repurchase 4.6 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $147 per share, and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion. Additionally, our first quarter dividend increased to $1.00 per share, an increase of 27% over last year. At the end of the first quarter, we had $4.2 billion remaining on our board authorized share buyback program and are on track to deliver on our capital allocation commitments to shareholders. Cash and investments totaled $34.7 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion from last year's first quarter level. This increase reflects strong net cash flow and our first quarter debt issuance of $2.9 billion, of which approximately $2 billion will be used to repay debt maturities over the balance of this year. Our debt balance stands at $34.3 billion as of March 31 of this year. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of 11 years. Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on page eight, we remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects solid Q1 performance from revenue and expense as well as a revised tax outlook. With this background, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion versus prior guidance of $22.0 billion to $22.5 billion. And our adjusted earnings per share guidance is now $10.85 to $11.20 a share versus prior guidance of $10.60 to $11.00. In addition, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be 19% to 20%, including the impact of the previously mentioned Accounting Standards Update, versus prior guidance of 19.5% to 20.5%. Finally, we expect to invest capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year. This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Thank you, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find a summary of our sales performance for the first quarter on slide number 10. As Bob said, we had a great start, with global product sales in the first quarter growing by 7% year over year. Our U.S. business delivered 9% year-over-year growth, and sales growth in our international business was negatively impacted by five percentage points due to foreign exchange. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, our international business was up 7% year over year. I will structure my comments in three categories today : performance in our growth products; how we are managing the life cycle of our mature brands; and conclude with an update on the performance of our newly launched products. First, our six growth products \u2013 Prolia, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate, Sensipar, and Enbrel \u2013 aggregated nearly $3 billion in sales or over 50% of the first quarter sales, growing 20% year over year. Sustaining their growth continues to be a priority for us. Let me start with Prolia and XGEVA, which are now annualizing at approximately $3 billion per year. Prolia grew significantly at 29% year over year. Continued share gains drove growth in both the U.S. and Europe, although with 25% year-over-year unit demand growth in both regions. We saw the typical seasonality in the first quarter. In the U.S., our direct-to-consumer promotional efforts continued to drive increasing levels of new patient adoption, and we are sustaining repeat injection rates of over 65%. We expect continued growth from Prolia to come for years. XGEVA grew 11% year over year. Unit share increased about three percentage points over last year in both the U.S. and Europe. The first quarter was positively impacted by increased levels of purchasing by some large end customers in the U.S., which we expect to burn off in the next quarter. We continue to focus on XGEVA's superior clinical profile versus the competition, and look forward to potential new indications, which will drive sustained long-term growth. Turning to Vectibix and Nplate, unit demand growth drove double-digit gains year over year across both products. For Vectibix, we continue to make solid inroads into earlier lines of therapy in both the U.S. and Europe. Sensipar grew 10% year over year, driven by net selling price as well as unit growth in the U.S. and Europe. With sales annualizing around $1.5 billion, Sensipar remains a growth driver. We look forward to adding Parsabiv as another treatment option for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Our regulatory filing for Parsabiv are currently under review in both the U.S. and Europe. Let me now turn to Enbrel. Enbrel grew 24% year on year, due to changes on net selling price and inventory, which was partially offset by competition. As a reminder, net selling price change comprises several components, including list price increases, as well as the rebates we provide to payers and the impact of formulary decisions. In the first quarter of 2016, inventory was at a normal level. The year-over-year inventory growth is as a result of prior year dynamics. Declines in inventory levels in the first quarter last year make for an approximately $100 million favorable comparison this quarter. As we think about the second quarter this year, we expect to see a reverse effect of a similar magnitude. In other words, the significant inventory build in the second quarter of 2015 will create an unfavorable comparison, assuming inventory levels remain normal next quarter. Turning to underlying performance for Enbrel, we saw 14% year-on-year growth in the rheumatology segment for the first quarter and Enbrel held quarter-over-quarter value share at 28%. In dermatology, competition from new entrants, primarily non-biologics, helped drive year-on-year segment growth of 29%. Enbrel's share in dermatology declined one percentage point quarter over quarter to 21%. If you'll recall, rheumatology comprises about 80% of Enbrel sales. Given Enbrel's exclusivity through 2029, it remains a critical growth driver that we are continuing to invest behind. Let me now turn to how we're managing the life cycle of our mature brands, starting with our ESA products. Aranesp sales increased 11% year over year, driven by 15% unit growth. In the U.S., we are successfully transitioning our medium sized and independent provider centers from EPOGEN to Aranesp. Aranesp now represents over 70% of ESA's share of these providers. International sales were negatively impacted by pricing pressures and foreign exchange rates. EPOGEN declined 44% year over year. About a third of this decline is a shift from EPOGEN to Aranesp in the dialysis setting I mentioned above. Most of the decline comes from the shift from Amgen ESA to Mircera at Fresenius. We understand that Fresenius, which represents about a third of the U.S. dialysis business, has converted over 70% of their patients to Mircera. If you remember, we have a contract with DaVita, which represents another third of the dialysis business, to 2018, to purchase at least 90% of the ESA's from Amgen. I'd also like to point out, we also do not expect biosimilar competition to EPOGEN in 2016. NEUPOGEN declined 13% year over year and 19% quarter over quarter, with a competitive landscape playing out as we generally expected. NEUPOGEN exited the quarter with a 64% share of the short-acting set segment, which now consists of ZARXIO, Granix, and Leukine. As we've said before, we continue to compete account by account as competition intensifies. We continue to emphasize the value of NEUPOGEN, all from its track record of safety, efficacy and reliable supply. Neulasta grew 4% during the quarter. Unit growth of 3% included purchases by some large U.S. end customers, which we expect to burn off next quarter. Let me now turn to our launches, beginning with the Neulasta Onpro Kit. The Neulasta Onpro Kit has been an extremely successful launch, achieving about one-third share of Neulasta units in the first quarter and approaching $1 billion in cumulative sales in the 12 months since launch. Patients undergoing minor sequence chemotherapy regimens are at high risk of serious infections. One of the biggest challenges physicians face in preventing these infections is patient compliance. Most insuring patients get the Neulasta injection after each course of chemo and at the right time, 24 hours after chemo. These are critical steps in order to insure maximum benefit from Neulasta. With the Neulasta Onpro Kit, we are able to address this important unmet need. This innovation also provides meaningful differentiation versus the traditional pre-filled syringe and potential future competitors. We also see the compliance rates improving with the use of Neulasta Onpro based on patient level data. This is a great example of our strategy to identify and develop innovative delivery systems to improve the patient experience. By all measures, this is a highly successful launch, and the value it brings to patients and the healthcare system is translating to strong performance. We remain focused on increasing adoption to benefit more patients. Kyprolis grew 43% year over year. On a sequential basis. U.S. unit growth was offset by unfavorable changes to inventory and to net selling price. The addition of ENDEAVOR data, which demonstrated its superiority versus Velcade to the U.S. label in January further solidifies Kyprolis' profile as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. We expect sales to continue to grow as we treat more second line patients, and they stay on therapy longer to achieve deeper and more durable responses. In markets outside the U.S., we are making good progress with our launches. Initial results have been very positive, as we bring this important therapy to these patients. BLINCYTO continues to increase patient penetration in the U.S. and launches are underway across Europe, as reimbursement is secured. Sean will discuss developments about the Vectibix antibody platform in a moment. IMLYGIC, our oncolytic immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma is currently indicated as monotherapy in the U.S. and Europe and is playing an important role in addressing the need for the small patient population. We believe that true potential for IMLYGIC lies in combination with other immunotherapies across different tumor types. Turning now to REPATHA, which I continue to believe is one of our largest opportunities. I'm pleased with our competitiveness to date. Our robust clinical development program clearly demonstrated REPATHA's ability to deliver intensive and predictable LDL-C reduction. This message continues to resonate well with physicians, and coupled with strong execution in the marketplace, we continue to lead prescribing in the U.S., as seen in the IMS data. In Europe, reimbursement negotiations are on track, and we're an early launch in several countries, including, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Scandinavia. In Japan, we have now received pricing approval and launch activities with our partner sellers are well underway. Before handing over to Sean, I thought I would provide some color on the REPATHA launch. In my personal experience, I've seen a number of examples of successful but high value, slower ramping products that share a few common traits with REPATHA. First, these products often contribute to changes in treatment paradigms such as new meclizine vaccine and new (23:05). In the case of REPATHA, inhibition of PCSK9 is a novel mechanism and it is the first injectable biologic addressing chronic cardiovascular disease. I'm excited about the prospect of launching the REPATHA monthly dosing option later this year, reducing the number of required injections and creating another potential point of difference from the competition. Second, these products often have significant development programs that improve the product profile, expand their patient pools, or extend duration of therapy over time. With REPATHA, how much we study with staffing and helping patients was well received by physicians, at the recent American College of Cardiology meeting. Our coronary imaging study, we'll read out later this year, and was designed to demonstrate that REPATHA reduces patients' blood burden. And most significantly, of course, we expect the read out of a large 27,500-patient outcomes trial later this year, which we expect will establish a clear benefit in cardiovascular outcomes based on REPATHA's profound effect on lowering LDL cholesterol. Lastly, access and reimbursement hurdles, while intense, should be overcome with a demonstration of superior clinical benefits versus the current standard of care. We expect to establish this with REPATHA through the outcomes study I just mentioned. You might have seen this dynamic successfully play out with the fact that tenase has displaced Warfarin. I am unwavering in my commitment and in the belief of REPATHA. We will continue to work with payers to improve access to REPATHA for appropriate patients and expect its strong value proposition to benefit patients with ASCVD who are at risk of heart attack or stroke. In closing, I'm pleased with our execution this quarter, and our strong start to the year. We've maintained focus on our growth brands while defending our mature portfolio and launching new products. We recognize that our launch products are an important long-term value driver and are working relentlessly to make them a success. Let me close by recognizing that none of this would have been possible without the dedication of our staff and thanking them for the commitment to delivery to patients. Let me now pass it to Sean. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. We've made a lot of exciting progress in Q1 as we continue to advance our pipeline of innovative programs. I'll begin my remarks with our cardiovascular franchise starting with REPATHA. Statin-associated muscle symptoms represent a major unresolved challenge for treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and often result in the use of therapies that provide less LDL cholesterol reduction than desired. In our recently completed Phase 3 study, GAUSS-3, we evaluated REPATHA and ezetimibe in a group of patients whose statin intolerance was verified by rigorous blinded statin rechallenge, where only those patients that experienced muscle related side effects on statin but not on placebo were studied. As presented at the ATC meeting and simultaneously published in the Journal of American Medical Association, the study demonstrated that REPATHA resulted in a significantly greater reduction in LDL cholesterol after 24 weeks as compared to Ezetimibe with low levels of muscle related adverse events. We believe this is an important result for those high-risk patients that are unable to effectively manage their LDL cholesterol due to muscle symptoms from statins. Looking ahead, as Tony mentioned, we continue to look forward to the results of our coronary imaging study and cardiovascular outcome studies in the second half of this year. We also continue to work closely with regulators on their reviews of our REPATHA monthly dosing option. Feedback from cardiologists on our innovative myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil, has been consistent that we have a very compelling mechanism of action in Phase 2 data set. We're currently working with our partners at Cytokinetics and Servier, as well as global regulators to define a potential path to Phase 3 outcomes studies. Turning to oncology, our Phase 3 open label study evaluating BLINCYTO versus standard of care in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory ALL was stopped at a pre-specified interim analysis after successfully achieving the primary endpoint of improved overall survival. This is a first for immunotherapy in this population, and we look forward to discussions with regulators as we seek conversions to full approval. In Q1 we also filed an SBLA for BLINCYTO in the U.S. to include new data supporting the treatment of pediatric and adolescent patients with ALL. We feel BLINCYTO could be an important treatment option for younger patients, potentially avoiding the complications later in life, such as secondary malignancies that can arise with the use of cytotoxic chemotherapies. We are advancing our bi-specific T-cell engager or BiTE platform, including AMG 330, which continues to enroll patients in its Phase 1 dose-escalation study. Recall that AMG 330 is our CD33 4ARM BiTE for acute myelitis leukemia, or AML. AML remains an area of profound unmet medical need. Despite adult AML being about four times as prevalent as adult ALL and with a very poor prognosis, there have been no significant advances approved in the last 20 years. Staying with our immuno-oncology platforms, we recently initiated enrollment in the Phase 3 portion of our melanoma study of Enlogic in combination with KEYTRUDA, Merck's PD-1 inhibitor, and we look forward to presenting the results from the Phase 1b portion of this study at the upcoming ASCO meeting. We also recently presented some encouraging first-in-human data at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting from one of our early stage immuno-oncology programs, AMG 820. This is our antibody against colony-stimulating Factor 1 receptor, also known as CFAMs, which stimulates the activation of tumor-associated macrophages. There's great interest in the role that tumor-associated macrophages play in tumor immunosuppression. And we're helping to lead this field with AMG 820, which is now enrolling patients in a Phase 1/2 study in combination with KEYTRUDA in advanced solid tumors. Before I leave oncology, I would note we continue to have productive interactions with regulators in Europe on the Kyprolis ENDEAVOR submission, and I'm also pleased to announce that our Phase 3 study of XGEVA versus zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma has completed its enrollment. This is an event-driven study. And based on the current event rate, we estimate the data will be available in the second half of this year. In bone health, we were pleased to report, along with our partners at UCB, the positive results from two Phase 3 romosozumab studies in Q1. Most importantly, our placebo-controlled pivotal fracture study met both of its primary vertebral fracture endpoints as well as the important secondary endpoint of clinical fracture reduction. This latter end point consists of symptomatic vertebral fractures plus non-vertebral fractures, an endpoint increasingly recognized by physicians, payers, and regulators, as these are the symptomatic fractures that can be life-altering. Our Phase 3 study of romosozumab in men with osteoporosis also successfully completed in Q1 with romosozumab treatment resulting in significant gains in bone marrow density versus placebo. We look forward to our pre-VLA meeting with FDA as we pull together our initial filing package in the U.S. We also await the results from the event-driven fracture study, evaluating romosozumab in comparison to alendronate treatment, which we expect to see in 2017 and will be part of our European filing. Switching to neuroscience, we had the opportunity to present the 52-week data from our Phase 2 episodic migraine study with our CGRP receptor antibody, AMG 334, at the American Academy of Neurology meeting earlier this month. After one year of treatment with a 70-milligram monthly dosing regimen, more than 60% of patients experienced at least a 50% reduction in their monthly migraine days, and about 20% of patients had no migraine days in month 12. These are patients that were having on the order of eight migraine days per month, so this is quite a clinically meaningful result. We believe the efficacy, tolerability, and administration profile of AMG 334 could be an attractive option for migraine patients, considering the lack of well-tolerated prophylactic options currently available. We are rapidly advancing this program through the clinic with our partners at Novartis. We now expect to have the results from our Phase 2b chronic migraine study midyear and we intend to use this study to potentially gain an indication in chronic migraines in our initial BLA filing. We've also completed now enrollment in both of our Phase 3 episodic migraine studies and expect the results from both of these in the second half of this year. Also in migraine, we believe that AMG 301, our PAC-1 receptor antibody, could complement AMG 334, and we continue to progress this asset through Phase 1. In other regulatory activities, we continue to work with global regulators on their review of Parsabiv, our novel intravenous calcimimetic for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on hemodialysis. FDA has also accepted our SBLA for the expanded use of Enbrel to treat pediatric patients with chronic, severe plaque psoriasis. Finally, with several pivotal data sets and regulatory decisions ahead of us, we have a lot to look forward to this year, and I'd like to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues at Amgen for their unwavering focus on delivering innovative new medicines for patients in need. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you, Sean. Let's turn it over now to questions. And, Arvind, why don't you remind our callers of the procedure. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yes, Jade, if you can, go ahead and open it up for Q&A and just review the procedure for asking questions, please. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks for taking my question, just a couple clarifications for Tony. You mentioned two end customer purchases for Neulasta and XGEVA. Can you tell how large they were? And then second, maybe if you could, just expand around your comments for REPATHA. I think it's our understanding that 70% to 80% of scripts are abandoned at the pharmacy. What's your view on what needs to change to lower that rate? And how should we think about the change that outcomes data, if positive, could have there? And is there a rate, a hazard ratio, for example, in the outcomes data, that you think would cause a significant shift in some of those utilization management criteria? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Okay, so let me try and go through those. So on the large customer end user purchases for XGEVA and Neulasta, so in the range of $30 million to $50 million, so not a large amount, but they will clearly burn off during the second quarter. When I look at REPATHA, it is about a 77% rejection rate, not abandonment, that's happening at the pharmacy. So a lot of the prescriptions being denied because they don't quite fit the prior auth process which has been required. Talking to cardiologists, it's clear that they are extremely frustrated at the moment because the patients they're sending in are appropriate patients who are not being properly managed on their maximum tolerated statin at the moment. We are spending quite a bit of time with payers at the moment, and helping them see the \u2013 what I would imagine that the unintended consequences of a rather onerous paper-based prior auth system, which is resulting in so many patients not getting access to drug when they should. So, I think with a bit more discussion, people will understand the importance of getting appropriate patients on drug. I think of some of the question in terms of narrowing the population is around what will the outcomes show. And there's no doubt in my mind that once we have limited proof that this drug actually results not only in lowering LDL, but in actually reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke, that more patients will gain access to the drug. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Jade, let's go with the next question, please. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to talk a little bit about romo, just looking at the non-vertebral fracture data, do you think that this could be a big variance competitively? And then, what's the outlook for the European filing based on the PMO data? Do you think that the \u2013 there's a risk that secondary end points that may have to be hit on that? Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jeff. Sean, why don't you take those questions? Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: In terms of the results, the second part of the question relates, I think, to the ability to file the data set in Europe, and we do believe the data will support registration as is in Europe, but we also have always planned to file both outcomes \u2013 fracture studies. So we have the alendronate controlled study in which the primary end point is clinical fracture that will be part of that \u2013 part of that file. I think that when you step back there are a couple things. One is that we need to present these data at the appropriate scientific congresses and publish them so that the experts in the field can look at the data, because the paradigm for the study design is so different than what people are used to with a three-year placebo-controlled portion rather than a one-year placebo-controlled portion. And in the end, the most important endpoint to look at with these therapeutics we've hit which, again, is the symptomatic vertebral fractures plus non-vertebral. And we had quite a significant effect size there as well as the transition from treatment with romosozumab on to Prolia where we continue to see benefit of romosozumab into the second year on Prolia. So overall, I think the data will be well-received when people are able to look at it in some detail. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first, just was wondering if you guys could comment on the Treasury notice and intercompany debt and any potential impact to your longer term tax rate. And then any potential for an FDA panel on etelcalcetide? Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Okay, David, why don't you take the first? David W. Meline - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so on the first one, so first of all Amgen, of course, is not a company that's inverted, so we're a U.S.-based company. And all of our debt is issued and received from third parties, so we don't see any impact on our business in terms of our ability to finance and the ability to deduct the interest expense from our earnings. So, right now we don't see any impact. But it's a pretty detailed and lengthy ruling so we continue to look at it, but we don't foresee any right now. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: And, Terence, it's Sean. We don't anticipate the need for an FDA advisory committee for Parsabiv. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Jade, let's take the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask a little bit about Kyprolis and if you were seeing any competition with DARZALEX or any of the other of the new regimens on the market. If you could give me color there, that would be great. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Okay. So let me answer that question. This is Tony. Clearly, as I said, the addition of the ENDEAVOR data to our label, giving us both a doublet and a triplet regimen in second line, both with clinical data showing great efficacy versus the prior regimens, has put us in a good position to give patients in second line plus a better opportunity. The data in the market is quite shallow because we haven't looked at the patient chart orders. But as I look at the orders for the first quarter, I see Kyprolis continue to hold market share in third line. I see continued growth in the second line. And I see the newer entrants with very slow single digit market shares and predominantly being used in fourth line plus. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So with regard to REPATHA access, assuming you get positive CVOT data later this year, what's your understanding of the process you'll need to follow in order to ease kind of current utilization management? I guess I'm wondering how fast things could open up, or if you're going to need to get the data and the label and renegotiate with payers first before you're able to tag a noticeable difference on that front? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : So, as Sean said, we're expecting the data in the latter end of this year. Once the data becomes clear it'll become public. And I think people will have to make up their minds what that actually means. It will be presented then in a peer-reviewed publication and presented at one of the large congresses where the data will become clear to all the prescribing cardiologists. We, of course, from a commercial perspective are not in a position to negotiate or talk to payers about the data until the FDA has approved it in our label. In the interim, however, our medical affairs organization can respond to questions that we receive from the payers in a balanced and medical way. But I'm assuming once this becomes clear, the details will just clarify the unique value of this particular product. Sean? Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: This is Sean. I think the other comment I would make is that you may have seen that the \u2013 that some of the U.S.-based guidelines for treatment of hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular risks were recently updated and included the concept of using the PCSK9 inhibitors after stepping through some other therapeutic options that have the cardiovascular outcomes data. It's my understanding from talking with many of the key opinion leaders who are either involved in the guidelines or just thought leaders in the field, there's \u2013 there's a clear desire to update these guidelines as fast as possible when the cardiovascular outcomes data are available. So that's an independent process from anything to do with getting good data into the label and can be a very important thing that payers look at when they make access decision. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Jade, let's take the next question. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys. Maybe a question for Bob. In this environment, biotech prices have obviously come down. So I'm wondering what your current feelings, Bob, are around hostile acquisitions? Thank you very much. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Mark, I don't know that I'd make any comments about hostile acquisitions but, as you've heard us say before, evaluations in some areas are more attractive this year than they were last and we have a strong balance sheet and we continue to look carefully both internally and externally for the most attractive programs that we can advance. But we look at all range of transactions, licensing, as well as M&A, and we consider them each individually. So I wouldn't speculate, Mark, about anything more than that at this point. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great, thanks, a question for Sean. The pivotal CGRP data is certainly coming and there's a wealth of data coming. You've talked in the past about your hypothesis, about your mechanism and some differentiation. Can you maybe update us on your thoughts about how you still see that playing out as some more data has come out and just where data has played out? Can you maybe list one or two things where you specifically see some differentiation or how that plays in the future? Thanks, Sean. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Michael. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: So, Michael, I don't think much has really changed in terms of the fact that there's sort of fundamental scientific principles here around the difference between a receptor antagonist and the ligand. We've always felt that the receptor antagonist would be more potent, and we're seeing that play out. We've always thought that might result in a situation in which the administration profile of the product was better than it would be if larger amounts of protein were necessary for delivery, for example, on a monthly basis in a subcutaneous delivery device. So, I continue to think that it's a relative advantage to have a more potent agent when you're trying to administer infrequent dosing subcutaneously. But whether that will be really play into being an important clinical differentiator when these products are out in the marketplace is, I think, too soon to know. Otherwise, we continue to push very hard on the product to get it to patients as fast as we can because there are about 26 million people with migraine in the United States, and among them there's somewhere in the order of 8 million to 10 million who have had attempts or are currently on and off of therapy for prophylaxis. So there's clearly a very large unmet medical need, and some proportion of that population would be an appropriate population, potentially, for this sort of therapeutic. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer from Piper Jaffray. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Okay. Thanks for taking the questions, and maybe one for Sean. Amgen has had such a strong track record advancing the Phase 3 programs through to commercialization. Curious as to what there is in the Phase 2 or earlier pipeline that you're most enthusiastic to move into Phase 3; you mentioned omecamtiv, curious as to what else. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Sure, I like to talk about that sort of thing. The certainly omecamtiv is very exciting. We also, as I mentioned, have another migraine prophylaxis antibody and of course, the potential to actually develop a bi-specific antibody that would address both of those pathways as a product behind that. Heart failure does remain a real focus for us, and we actually are introducing a novel, completely novel heart failure medicine into the clinic in a matter of days from now, which is exciting and have quite a few early discovery-level programs in that area. Cardiovascular more broadly, we have some very interesting things we're working on in the early and midstage pipeline. And of course, the BiTE platform has a very large number of products in pre-clinical phases that are moving toward the clinic. And we're seeing a situation in which we're going to be introducing into the clinic multiple different therapies in some cases, with different targets directed at the same hematological malignancy, for example, and are having to envision some interesting multi-armed clinical trials to try to get some efficiency in the testing when we have so many things coming forward simultaneously. So there's a lot going on. Because of everything that happens, that's happening at the commercialization interface, we don't get a lot of time to talk about that, and perhaps we'll have an opportunity in an upcoming business review setting to go through some of this in some more detail. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just thinking a little bit big picture on the REPATHA launch, I think you called it like a slow launch. And you were talking about working with payers. How much are you willing to participate and deal with price versus, say, mortality outcomes? So what's the balance of lowering price and mortality outcomes as far as opening up access? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Robyn, it's Tony. Clearly as we've said, we bring our products to market with a clear debate and discussion around the pharmoeconomic value of the products. There was an extrapolated value that these drugs would actually result in reduction of both stroke, heart attack, and early untimely death, and I think we will continue to bring the value to market. There are rebates in the marketplace at the moment, and that dynamic will continue over time as we jostle for formulary positions. But I think what we bring to market at the moment is a pretty decent and acceptable value proposition to treat patients at high risk. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Eun Yang from Jefferies. Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC : Thank you for taking the question, a question on Parsabiv. With the bundled payment in dialysis, what do you think could the pricing power be for the product like this, particularly since Parsabiv is expected to go generic in a couple of years? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : All right, so it's Tony. Let me answer that one. So as you know, CMS have gone with a two-year period, that this product will operate outside of the bundle under the ASP pricing method, which will give CMS two years to evaluate the product value and then to make a decision how much value is put into the bundle when the product moves from ASP into the bundle. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from B-of-A Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first one for maybe Sean to talk about a few outcome trials here. I know you guys never disclose the powering assumption or the assumption for event rate. But should we assume that it's probably similar to what your competitor has talked about? And then secondly, I have a question on the EPO market. So Fresenius is switching to Mircera from Roche. You have a long-term contract with DaVita. What is your thought of the other one-third of the market with EPO and also (52:15) going forward? Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We'll take this in two parts. Sean will take your first question and then Tony can address your EPO question. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Actually both we and Regeneron and Sanofi have published papers on the design of these studies, where there's a quite a bit of detail in the way that they were constructed. And in the end, these types of studies differ largely on the issue of how long it takes to enroll the population and what the event rate is once you get patients enrolled. There are not, we don't believe \u2013 we would not anticipate large differences in the event rates between the two populations, but there will be some difference in event rate. And I think both companies have set their studies up so that they would be able to detect what was considered to be a clinically meaningful minimum effect size, so typically one would set these kind of trials up so that you wouldn't miss a 20% reduction in risk. Obviously, you may be looking for more, but that would be the way you power the trial. So there are more similarities than there are differences. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Okay, so let me answer your question on the dialysis market. You're right, the market is broken into three. DaVita is responsible for about one-third of the market. We have a contract with them that is exclusive that runs to 2018. Fresenius, who is responsible for another one-third of the market are in the process of converting a lot of their patients. The last time they made any numbers public, they were talking about just over 70% conversion to Mircera. The other one-third of the market is the independent medium and small dialysis units. In that setting, we have converted about 70% of the EPOGEN usage to Aranesp. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges from Leerink Partners. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you, I appreciate the question. Tony, a couple for you. Could you talk a little bit about price on Enbrel, the contribution of price? Should we just infer that it's the difference between the growth, the units, and the inventory? It looks about 20%. And could you just talk about whether that looks to be sustainable given the market environment? And then on a related note, could you talk about the value proposition for AMG 334? Certainly, millions of patients out there with migraine, but you can imagine payers preparing to do some of the things that they did for REPATHA. So how do you think that you're going to approach the value proposition of that indication to avoid the sort of really tight restrictions that you've encountered? Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Okay. So let's go back to the front end. Just to reconfirm again, what we report and what we talk about in terms of net price, and really that's a combination of the list price minus the rebates and/or formulary positions you have in the marketplace. I think as a company we're acutely aware of the issues facing the industry in the U.S. at the moment. But Amgen's all about innovation, right? So we price our drugs around the pharmacoeconomic value of the products as we bring them to market. Enbrel itself, of course, is competing in a highly competitive marketplace where several large players are competing for formulary position to enable patient access. At the same time, the health plans and the PBNs are negotiating price concessions on large rebates to set up formulary placements themselves and it's because of the magnitude of these rebates that price increases have become part of this overall dynamic. So, it's an integrative process flow as we go forward. Talking about 334, as Sean has said again and again, this is a huge unmet medical need in the marketplace where existing therapies have side effects that are sometimes as bad as the disease itself. Unlike most other diseases, patients with chronic migraine really know about it. It's debilitating. It's devastating. And some of the initial research we've done have shown a much higher inclination or preparedness to pay a co-pay because patients really want to get rid of the disease as quick as they can. I think most of the patients who are available to us have been on therapy for some time and were able to show they've been on therapy. So step edits I'm sure will be there. But there's a large bolus of patients who have failed consistently on existing treatment in the marketplace. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : So, Jade, I'm noticing that it's fast approaching 6 :30 on the East Coast. Why don't we take two last questions? Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo Securities. Yanan Zhu - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, thanks for squeezing us in. This is actually Yanan Zhu in for Jim. I wanted to ask a question on the CGRP program, specifically on the regulatory path. As you know, it's a competitive space with four players. You have the clear lead, the first Phase 3 data readout for that frequent episodic migraine indication. However, in a chronic migraine indication, it's a little less clear, because others have Phase 3 programs ongoing. Interestingly, you just mentioned, you commented that you might use the Phase 2 data that is going to read out \u2013 the Phase 2b data in chronic migraine \u2013 to support a BLA. Our question is, do you think you will seek a chronic migraine indication based on the Phase 2b data? Have there been any discussion with regulators on that? Thanks. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: This is Sean. I think that the things have you to take into account is that the chronic migraine Phase 2b study is quite a large study and it explores doses that are used in the two large Phase 3 episodic migraine studies. And these are obviously \u2013 there's a spectrum of disease here \u2013 and while there is a separate regulatory entity of chronic migraine and episodic migraine, the path of physiology is probably quite shared across these as evidenced by the fact that all the CGRP antagonists are having similar efficacy in the different patient populations. So it's our feeling that taken together, the aggregate data could potentially support both indications being granted at least by some of the global regulators. And I would not typically go into the discussions about the specific conversations we've had with regulators, but I'd just say that we feel that it's a very reasonable approach to attempt to get both indications based on the aggregate data package. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great, let's take one last question. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Jeff Chen from Cowen & Company. Jeff Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. For Tony, could you just discuss a little bit more about REPATHA in EU and Japan in terms of your experience of access and reimbursement? And if you think that the CVOT outcomes data will change the negotiation, or would that be a new round of negotiations? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : So I think if you've heard people talk about the (1:00:36) performance in Europe where once the price has been set and reimbursement is agreed, there's no longer an economic decision around every prescription, so uptake happens quite fast. So I believe that as we get into growing into this marketplace, pricing is just about set. When you come in with larger expanded patient population groups, there's a chance in Europe, you have to go back in it in a country-by-country negotiation. In Japan, historically, that hasn't happened as much, and the pricing we receive in Japan seems to be a longer play-through from pricing. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, everybody, for your participation on this busy, busy day. Of course, I'll be around together with the rest of my team, so if we can offer any further assistance, please give me a call. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Amgen's First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : My name is DeMarcus Ross, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request you to limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, DeMarcus. Good afternoon, everybody. So I'd like to welcome you to our conference call to discuss our second quarter financial results. I would like to particularly extend a warm welcome to those who are new in their investment coverage of Amgen, including Ronny Gal and Vincent Chen of Bernstein. Our second quarter once again is a continuation of great execution of how we are effectively managing the life cycle of legacy products while launching new products. Of course, there's much more to our execution. So to have the broader discussion, I'm joined today by Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO, who will lead the call with a strategic overview. Our CFO, David Meline, will then review our quarterly results and update you on our guidance for 2016. Following David, our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will discuss our product performance during the quarter, followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. We should have plenty of time for Q&A after Sean's comments. So before I turn the call over to Bob, I would like to note that we have reviewed the Securities and Exchange Commission's recent guidance regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and our press release incorporates this revised guidance. As in the past, we will use slides for our presentation today, which have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by email. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful to understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results, and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release on Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website. Just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation are forward-looking statements, and our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Great, thank you, Arvind, and thank you all for joining our call. Our business continues to perform well, as you can see through the results the first six months of the year, with our revenues up 8% and our adjusted earnings per share up 13%. While delivering strong and consistent quarter-to-quarter performance, we're also investing successfully for the long term, and the elements of our long-term strategy for growth are clearly progressing as well. We launched six new products last year, two in the cardiovascular arena and four in cancer, and these products are still in the early stages of their launch cycle globally. We remain particularly excited about the long-term prospects of Repatha and look forward to important clinical data, set to emerge later this year and early next year, which we think will help fully illuminate the value of this product. Kyprolis is also a top priority. Based on the very strong clinical profile of Kyprolis, we expect this product to be a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy for the foreseeable future, and as such, for it to be used in combination with many of the new agents that are emerging in the field. Both of these products are making progress internationally, with additional regulatory approvals and reimbursement negotiations proceeding well. Behind the recent launches of our six drugs for cardiovascular disease and cancer, we have programs nearing key regulatory milestones in four other therapeutic areas : neurology, where we are excited about erenumab as a potential first-in-class therapy for migraine; bone health, where we recently submitted our bone-building romosozumab to the FDA for regulatory review; nephrology, with the prospect of an imminent launch of Parsabiv; and of course in inflammation, where we were pleased with the recent FDA panel review of our biosimilar to Humira. With an expected 80 new launches across countries and products this year and the recent reacquisition of rights to many of our existing products outside the United States, we're meaningfully expanding our global footprint. To that end, we recently announced that we have partnered with Daiichi Sankyo in an effort to bring Amgen biosimilars to the Japanese market. I would also note that we're excited about the scientific progress we're making in our early research labs. For example, we continue to harness the power of our human genetics platform to uncover fundamental links to human disease. As you saw this quarter, we published research pointing to the role of the ASGR1 gene in cardiovascular disease. While this is still early stage, it highlights our unique ability to generate insights like this and to move them forward quickly in the drug development process. We expect insights such as this to be central to our ability to innovate and continue to deliver long-term growth and returns for our shareholders. While we're focused on the long term, we're committed to delivering in the short and medium term as well. Our consistent strong performance has placed us well on our way towards delivering the long-term commitments we made to shareholders for 2018. The transformation program, which we began some two years ago, continues to deliver savings, enabling us to invest in our business and deliver results for our shareholders. Similarly, the commitment we made to effectively manage the life cycle of our legacy products is bearing fruit, as reflected in the success of our Neulasta Onpro launch and the success that we're having in offering Aranesp and EPOGEN to our dialysis customers. Our balance sheet remains strong and we're active in looking for ways to build our business across our six therapeutic focus areas. And we expect to be patient and disciplined in looking for opportunities that we think we can add value to for our shareholders. Before passing to our Chief Financial Officer, David Meline, let me just thank our staff worldwide for their ongoing dedication to our mission of serving patients and for the results they've once more delivered for our shareholders. David? David W. Meline - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the second quarter financial results on page six of the slide deck, revenues at $5.7 billion grew 6% year over year, with 5% product sales growth, driven by continued momentum across much of our product portfolio. Other revenues at $214 million increased $69 million versus the second quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited from higher Ibrance royalty income as well as an upfront partner payment. As a reminder, we receive an 8% royalty on Ibrance revenue, which was acquired as part of the Onyx transaction. Changes in foreign exchange had an immaterial impact on total revenue and product sales in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income at $2.8 billion grew 10% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved to 51.4% for the quarter, reflecting continued growth and progress from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories. In 2016 we remain on track to deliver over $400 million of incremental gross efficiency savings from the transformation versus prior year, with half of incremental gross efficiency savings from the transformation occurring in the first half. Delivering on this transformation enables continued investment in our pipeline and launch activities while also achieving solid profitability. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales at 13.5% improved by 1.6 points, driven by manufacturing efficiencies and higher net selling price. Research and development expenses at $878 million decreased by 4% versus last year, driven primarily by transformation and process improvement efforts and lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs. SG&A expenses increased 13% on a year-over-year basis, as increased commercial investments in new product launches for the U.S. and global launch activities were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year over year. Other income and expenses were a net $176 million expense in Q2. This is an increase of $97 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year net expense increase was primarily due to gains in the second quarter of 2015 from our strategic and venture investment portfolio. We expect our other income and expenses to continue at the current year-to-date trend level. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, a 1.4-point decrease versus Q2 of 2015. This decrease reflects discrete benefits associated with tax incentives and the adoption of accounting standards 2016-09, partially offset by unfavorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings. Non-GAAP net income increased 9%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 11% year over year. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page seven, free cash flow was $2.5 billion for the quarter compared to free cash flow of $3.2 billion in the second quarter of 2015. This year-over-year decline reflects timing impacts of income tax payments to the IRS and cash gains realized last year from foreign exchange contracts, which benefited from the strengthened U.S. dollar. We deployed a $0.6 billion to repurchase 3.9 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $153 per share, and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion. Additionally, our second quarter dividend was $1.00 per share, an increase of 27% over last year, which results in a dividend yield of over 2.5% on an annualized basis. At the end of the second quarter, we had $3.6 billion remaining on our board authorized share buyback program. Cash and investments totaled $35 billion, an increase of $5 billion from last year's second quarter level. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow and the first quarter debt issuance of $2.9 billion, of which approximately $900 million was used to repay debt maturities during the second quarter. Our debt balance stands at $33.2 billion as of June 30, 2016. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and an average maturity of 12 years. Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on page eight, we remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today, we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects continued conviction in executing on our strategy and solid first half performance of the business. In particular, our overall revenue guidance reflects our recent product launch activities plus continued progress on our growth brands, which grew 13% year over year in Q2 and accounted for over 50% of overall product sales. All of this is while absorbing the impact of competition on our legacy EPOGEN and NEUPOGEN brands. With this background, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion versus prior guidance of $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion. And our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is now $11.10 to $11.40 a share versus prior guidance of $10.85 to $11.20. Finally, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20% and capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year. This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Thanks, David. You'll find a summary of our sales performance for the second quarter on slide number 10. We continued our strong performance in the second quarter, with global product sales growing 5% year over year. Our U.S. business delivered 5% year-over-year growth, and our international business grew 3%, or 5% year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Europe was a strong contributor, with 11% unit growth. My comments will be in three parts today : first, the performance of our growth products; followed by an update of our life cycle management of the mature brands; and then I'll conclude with highlights on the performance of our newly launched products. Our six growth products, Prolia, XGEVA, ENBREL, Sensipar, Vectibix, and Nplate, continue to drive our overall performance with 13% year-over-year growth. As David said, they aggregated to $3 billion of sales, or over 50% of second quarter sales. We continue our investments in these brands to achieve their full potential. Both Prolia and XGEVA are now annualizing at over $3 billion per year. Prolia grew 30% year over year with a 24% unit growth and continued share gains in both the U.S. and Europe. Post-menopausal osteoporosis remains a widely untreated disease. In the U.S. alone, 10 million people are affected, and 4.5 million of those are considered at high risk of fracture. Unfortunately, nearly 60% of these patients are not treated. We are investing in Prolia to reach these under-served patients and also to remind current Prolia patients about the importance of returning every six months for their treatment. XGEVA saw a 15% year-over-year growth, driven by unit share gains of around two percentage points in both the U.S. and Europe. Quarter-over-quarter growth was negatively impacted by heavier purchasing from some larger end customers in the U.S. during the first quarter. ENBREL grew 10% year over year, driven by changes in net selling price, partially offset by competition. As a reminder, changes in net selling price comprise several components, including changes in list price as well as the impact from rebates we provide to payers and formulary decisions. Turning now to the underlying performance of ENBREL, growth within both the rheumatology and dermatology segments continues. Sequentially, ENBREL lost two points of value share in each segment. Recall that rheumatology comprises about 80% of ENBREL sales. ENBREL has a long track record of safety, efficacy, and a very competitive profile. We are focused on maintaining our position, particularly in the rheumatology segment. Sensipar grew 13% year over year, driven by net selling price as well as a strong unit growth in U.S. and Europe. We look forward to expanding our presence in the nephrology market with Parsabiv, which is currently being reviewed by the U.S. and European regulators as a new treatment option for secondary hyperparathyroidism. Next, Vectibix; we delivered strong unit growth in our core markets. However, this performance was masked by comparing against a quarter two in 2015 that benefited from an additional shipment to our Japanese partner. Nplate grew 14% year over year, driven by double-digit unit growth. I'd now like to focus on how we're managing the life cycle around mature brands. Neulasta sales decreased 1% year over year. The second quarter was negatively impacted by heavier purchasing by some large end customers in the U.S. in the first quarter. I am pleased to report that the Neulasta Onpro delivery kit continued its strong uptake. Adoption is growing due to its ability to ensure maximum benefit of Neulasta while improving the patient experience versus the traditional pre-filled syringe. We exited the second quarter with Onpro representing about 40% of Neulasta units and still growing. We do not expect long-acting filgrastim biosimilar competition this year, so there remains a significant opportunity to further increase the adoption of Onpro. As regards to NEUPOGEN, we see the short-acting segment playing out as expected. We ended the second quarter with around 6% share. We continue to compete account by account, emphasizing NEUPOGEN's sustained track record of safety, efficacy, and of course reliable supply. Now to the ESAs; Aranesp sales increased 5% year over year, driven by 13% unit growth. In the U.S., we've been successfully transfusing about 75% of patients from EPOGEN to Aranesp in our medium-sized and independent dialysis centers. EPOGEN declined 33% year on year. About one-third of this decline is the shift from EPOGEN to Aranesp in the dialysis setting I just mentioned. Most of the remaining decline is due to a shift by Fresenius from Amgen ESAs to their own product. We understand that Fresenius, which has about one-third of the U.S. dialysis business, has converted about 80% of their patients. You'll recall that our contract with DaVita, who represent another one-third of the dialysis business, runs through 2018. We do not expect biosimilar competition against EPOGEN in 2016. Lastly, I'd like to update you on Repatha and KYPROLIS. Both products represent substantial opportunity in addressing serious diseases with significant unmet needs, first Repatha. Our cardiovascular teams have executed well in the marketplace, but strict utilization management criteria and processes employed by the insurers and PBMs continues to be the biggest hurdle. We're working diligently to address these restrictions so that appropriate patients are able to access the treatment their doctors prescribe for them. We look forward to the coronary imaging data from the GLAGOV study reading out later this year, and then the FOURIER outcomes data in the first quarter of 2017. We expect that both these studies will further underscore the value of Repatha. We're also excited to now offer a new monthly dosing treatment option with our recently approved Repatha Pushtronex, the first and only single monthly injection of a PCSK9 inhibitor. Like the Neulasta Onpro delivery kit, this is another example of our ability to identify and develop innovative delivery systems to improve the patient experience. Outside the U.S., we continue to make good progress with Repatha's reimbursement negotiations on a country-by-country basis. In Europe, we are now in early launches in several countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Austria, and Sweden. Repatha is an extremely important medicine for high-risk cardiovascular patients, and we are committed to realizing its significant potential over time. Now to KYPROLIS, where we've made great progress in the quarter. We continue to grow volume in an intensely competitive environment with three new competitors, all approved in the U.S. late last year. This growth is encouraging as we continue to educate physicians on the benefits of KYPROLIS as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. Our focus is on continuing to drive adoption of KYPROLIS in relapsed patients based on the compelling ASPIRE and the ENDEAVOR data. The early launches from our European organization into second-line are very encouraging. KYPROLIS has been well received and we continue to gain reimbursement approval country by country. The EU label now includes KYPROLIS in both a three-drug regimen based on the ASPIRE data as well as a two-drug regimen based on the ENDEAVOR data. In summary, the second quarter was another strong quarter for Amgen. Our growth products led the way while we defended our mature products. We've made good progress on bringing new launch products to more patients in both existing and new countries. And we remain convinced about the long-term growth potential of our launch brands and are working intensely to ensure their success. Let me close by recognizing that none of this would have been possible without the dedication of our staff and thanking them for their commitment to delivering for patients. Let me now pass you to Sean. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. We continued to make good progress advancing our pipeline of both innovative and biosimilar molecules. Let me begin with cardiovascular. We don't believe there is any compelling evidence that supports treating high-risk atherosclerotic patients with anything but aggressive LDL cholesterol lowering therapy. Our approach with Repatha differs from that taken by the other marketed PCSK9 inhibitor in that we only maximally inhibit PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol. Our clinical program demonstrated that we could achieve this effect with either 140 milligrams of Repatha delivered every other week or 420 milligrams delivered monthly. And, as reflected in our label, these two dosing schedules were clinically equivalent. Now that we've received approval in the United States for the innovative Pushtronex delivery system, we can offer patients the choice of an auto-injector pen for every other week or single monthly dose administration with Pushtronex. As we announced last month, we expect the results from our Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study to be available in 1Q of 2017, in time for submission to the American College of Cardiology meeting in March. I would remind you that this is an event-driven study. And at the time we had accrued in excess of 85% of the requisite events, which allowed us to more accurately predict the timing for the study completion. This is a large study at 27,500 patients, and we remain focused on generating the most robust data set possible in this field from an analysis of the completed study. Ahead of this, we also expect the coronary imaging study results later this year, which we expect to complement the cardiovascular outcomes data. In heart failure, after discussions with regulators on omecamtiv mecarbil, our novel cardiac myosin activator from Cytokinetics, we have submitted our heart failure outcomes study protocol for Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, to the FDA and continue to work with our partners toward advancing in this novel area. Turning to oncology, we were pleased to receive European approval for Kyprolis in combination with dexamethasone in the relaxed refractory multiple myeloma setting based on the ENDEAVOR data. In the first-line setting, we're conducting CLARION, an approximately 900-patient head-to-head superiority study for Kyprolis versus Velcade, both administered concomitantly with melphalan and prednisone in transplant ineligible subjects with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. This has a primary endpoint of progression-free survival. Based on the current event rates, we now expect the primary analysis and top line results of the completed study in the second half of this year. Before I leave multiple myeloma, I'd like to remind you we remain on track to complete our Phase 3 study of XGEVA versus zoledronic acid in the prevention of skeletal-related events. In the quarter, we announced that FDA had granted Priority Review status to BLINCYTO for the treatment of pediatric Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed refractory ALL, with a PDUFA action date of September. In the adult population, we had the opportunity last month at ASCO to present the results of our confirmatory Phase 3 study of BLINCYTO. In this study, BLINCYTO demonstrated an almost twofold increase in median overall survival compared to the standard of care. We will be discussing these data with regulators as we seek conversion to full approval in our current indication. As we announced last week along with our partners at UCB, we have submitted our romosozumab BLA to the FDA for the treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women at increased risk for fracture. We'll be presenting the data from the pivotal Phase 3 FRAME study at the annual meeting of the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research in September, and we look forward to sharing the results with the medical community. Recall we're also running a Phase 3 fracture study of romosozumab compared to alendronate, which will contribute to our submission in Europe, and we expect these data in 2017. For Prolia, later this year we will be reviewing the data from our Phase 3 study in the setting of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, a relatively small but medically important indication. Our neuroscience programs continue to advance. In our migraine collaboration with Novartis, we were pleased to receive positive results for erenumab, or AMG 334, our CGRP receptor antibody, in our Phase 2b chronic migraine study. These data will be presented at the European Headache and Migraine Trust International Congress in September. This was a large robust study, and we believe that these data together with our two Phase 3 studies in episodic migraine reading out later this year could support registration in some jurisdictions. So we intend to seek both indications in our initial submission. Our other clinical migraine program is our PAC-1 antibody, AMG 301, which is currently proceeding nicely through Phase 1 development. PAC-1 is a receptor for PACAP, a neuropeptide implicated in migraine. We believe that AMG 301 has the potential to be additive or synergistic to erenumab given that PAC-1 is mechanistically differentiated from CGRP, and we're therefore pursuing the concept of a bi-specific PAC-1 and CGRP receptor antibody as well. In our nephrology franchise, we continue to work with regulators on our Parsabiv application and look forward to our PDUFA date in the U.S. next month. Parsabiv provides an opportunity to offer a novel intravenous calcimimetic option that's administered by healthcare providers three times a week, coincident with the patient's dialysis session. Parsabiv will be the first therapy approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in over a decade. Finally, within our biosimilars program, last week we announced results from our Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 980 compared to trastuzumab, or Herceptin, in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Based on the overall bioanalytics, efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity, we believe there are no clinically meaningful differences between ABP 980 and trastuzumab. And we look forward to discussing these data with regulators. As always, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued advancement of important new medicines for patients around the world. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you, Sean. As you can see, it's another active quarter here at the company, but I hope you'll agree another quarter of solid execution as we make progress towards our short, medium, and long-term goals of delivering growth for shareholders. So with that, why don't we turn it over to the question-and-answer session? And perhaps we can ask our operator to remind you of the procedure for asking questions. Operator : Absolutely. Your first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thanks for taking the questions, maybe two for me. Just first on the COGS, pretty impressive versus a year ago, just wondering if that level is sustainable longer term. And then on Repatha, Sean, can you remind us what you want to see out of the IVUS trial and if there's any potential read-through to the outcomes data coming next year? Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, Terence, we'll try and take those in two parts. I'll ask David to speak first about the question about COGS, and then Sean can talk about Repatha. But big picture, as you know, we've been working towards improving the efficiency and productivity of our manufacturing organization for some time. You've heard us say before, Terence, we think manufacturing is a source of competitive advantage for Amgen, and we're excited about what we've achieved to-date and where we're going next with the introduction of our next-generation bio-manufacturing. So generally the trend is positive. You see that reflected in the quarter. And, David, do you want to provide any more specific guidance on that? David W. Meline - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, very much the same, Bob. So what we're seeing is, as you would know, we consolidated our manufacturing activity to try to improve the efficiency, and you're now seeing that coming through into the results. So I would say through time, we'll seek to maintain our cost of sales at that very competitive level, recognizing there will be some pressure on us in terms of the cost of sales as we introduce the new portfolio. But we think it's a reasonable trajectory overall. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: And, Terence, I think with regard to the IVUS study and the outcomes, the way to think about this is that what we're pursuing here in both studies is the hypothesis that, as we continue to lower LDL, the relationship between LDL and outcomes will be maintained that we've observed with statin therapy over the last 20 years. And within the IVUS dimension, there has been a clear relationship between the lowering of LDL and the volume of plaque. And that linear relationship looks remarkably similar to the one that you see when you look at outcomes versus LDL. And there is a known relationship between that IVUS type effect and outcomes. So it all does tie together, and I think that we would be expecting to see conceptually what we believe that the benefits that are observed both with respect to impact on slowing the progression of plaque volume or causing regression of plaque volume as well as in the outcomes dimension, that these are all mediated in the case of statins by the lowering of LDL cholesterol. So we expect that pound for pound, if you will, with the LDL cholesterol lowering, we will see very similar results. So I think those are the hypotheses we're testing with the two studies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC: Congrats on a really solid quarter, maybe a couple quick ones for Tony. Can you talk about the impact that Darzalex is having on Kyprolis? It does look like from the monthly IMS data that we get that there's been a little competitive impact there. And then second, I was surprised to see that Amgen is branching out into the ultra-orphan space, at least with an eculizumab biosimilar. Can you talk about how that program might fit commercially with your current capabilities? Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Okay, thanks, Eric. As you know, the data inside the multiple myeloma market is a bit more complicated to try and segment between first, second and third-line plus, and we often have to use chart orders for that. Based on the data we've seen, Darzalex is clearly a good product, but we truly see the combination potentially of this product and Kyprolis as a future regimen in treating multiple myeloma. Most of the usage we've seen with Darzalex at the moment is fourth-line plus, however. To your question on our new biosimilar opportunity, I think Amgen has specialized for many years in specialty drugs with a focus target population, with low resources required to get to prescribers and to identify patients. So I think that one fits quite well with our model. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks for taking the question. If I could ask, just maybe if you could, comment broadly on biosimilars. You've got three that are at regulatory submission or in regulatory submission. Could you just walk through what your thoughts are around when you might be able to launch those products, some of the remaining legal hurdles that you're going to have to get through, and how you see that revenue stream developing over the next year or two? Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Matthew, a couple things. First, as you know, we have some nine programs that are under development. Over time, we think those could be an important source of growth and revenue opportunity for us at Amgen. We think that our commitment to developing these biosimilars reflects our belief. The capabilities we have established for our innovative business will lend themselves well to developing a branded biosimilar portfolio as well. The next step for us on the three that are in advanced regulatory stages is the same path for each of the three. It starts with needing to get regulatory approval. So we hope and expect that we'll have an opportunity to get regulatory approval for our first, which is the biosimilar Humira, later this year. And with the benefit of that then, with that approval in hand, we'll turn to the questions of commercialization, as we will for the other two. So first thing we need to do is get approvals, and that's what we're working on securing right now. As to your question about revenue profile and what we're going do when the approvals are in hand, we'll wait and comment on those issues at the appropriate time, Matthew. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys, thanks for taking the question. Sean, I have a couple for you on erenumab. The first one, for the chronic migraine data last month, how would you view the baseline migraine data relative to \u2013 just put that in context with the real world? Second point, as we look forward to the episodic data, obviously a more variable population. Maybe help us with how you'd characterize a result as being clinically meaningful in this population. Thanks. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Sure. I think when we look at the data from the chronic migraine study, it appears to us as though we have enrolled there a very representative population of this type of afflicted group. And as you know, these people are suffering with just an unimaginable number of these headaches per month. As we talk to the experts in the field, it seems that the population that we enrolled there in terms of the baseline level of headache and the kind of response that we saw in comparison to other product candidates in this axis are all as we might have expected. In the episodic migraine setting, of course, the baseline number of headache days are by definition less, but the treatment effect is still quite robust and reproducible, and I think that's been the case. It's within the world of neuroscience products, quite remarkable when you look at the data across the small molecules that have been entered in this space, the ligand-sequestering antibodies and erenumab that you see a remarkably consistent treatment effect. One comment I'd make is that it's the case that this treatment effect is robust, it's reproducible, but there also is quite a large placebo effect that patients get that comes along with the treatment effect, and it's durable over a long period of time. This is actually what the patient experiences, which is not unique to neuroscience but it's particularly potent in this setting. It's a little hard to get your mind around that sometimes, but this is what people who actually care for these patients emphasize to us to when we look at the data. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. One, can you give us a little bit more color on the timing around biosimilar eculizumab data that's the study in New Zealand? And then also on a second point, can you just frame for us how you think about some of the competitors in the migraine space and how your drug may stack up? Is it a matter of differentiation or is it just a commercial battle in your mind? Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, a couple different questions here. We'll start with the migraine question, Sean, then we'll talk about the field. Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: What I would say again, and I just made this comment that when you look at what's gone on where mainly companies that have been driving for proof-of-concept and/or dose-ranging their products, they've used doses of either small molecules, ligand-sequestering antibody or receptor antibodies in our case that are saturating the system. And when that happens, that's how across all these different studies across different companies and so on, you're seeing a very consistent result because you're maxing out the impact that inhibiting CGRP can have in migraine. So that's nice to see. And then really it comes down to the question of what is the minimal dose that's effective in achieving that effect. And I think then the devil gets into the details really around the issue of how easily administrable is that particular amount of antibody. So there's going to be a certain milligram amount of antibody that has to be administered. Let's say we believe a monthly subcutaneous disposable auto-injector would be a very nice solution to this otherwise healthy active type of population. And I think that others of course are pursuing strategies that are different than that, and I think it will be interesting, obviously, to see how that all plays out. Tony, you could comment. But I think scientifically, I've not seen any data to suggest that these products are different from one another with respect to what they can achieve when they are dosed and saturating quantity. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Sure. So we've seen the good clinical data, and I think there will be clearly a need for a good marketing plan, a good strategy, a good share of voice, and understanding what makes patients move to request this type of medication. The market is hugely unmet at the moment. There's a large amount of patients who are clamoring consistently and looking for help to try and treat this terrible disease. So it's a combination of both clinical science and a good strategy. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : With respect to your biosimilar question, Alethia, we've disclosed that we've begun the program, and that's all we're disclosing at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, good afternoon, a question on Parsabiv, which has a PDUFA date. The Sensipar franchise is over $1 billion. Can you just remind us how to think about the new product versus the loss of exclusivity period for Sensipar? If there's a swapping, how do we think about that line item as that product comes on? And then to follow up on Repatha, can you remind us how much usage is once-monthly now? I assume it's small. But what do you expect that to be over time, once monthly? Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Michael, we're having a little trouble hearing you, but I think you had two questions that Tony can address, the first about Parsabiv, which, as you know, is the subject of a PDUFA date later this summer. And then with respect to the once-monthly Repatha, I think that's the question Michael was asking. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : So let's start with the Parsabiv question. As you know, Sensipar has been extremely successful in treating patients both in the U.S. and around the world. But in spite of the efficacy of Sensipar, we probably only have about a 26% penetration. Compliance or patient persistency in this particular market is always an issue to ensure patients who are on dialysis three times a week actually take their tablets every day as well. Parsabiv brings a combination of potentially a better level of persistency because you'll be infused while you're having your dialysis. But the second thing is, as you've seen from the clinical data, in fact, there appear to be a much more robust level of efficacy of Parsabiv. CMS have granted us a two-year period that this product will exist outside the bundle while they determine the medical value, to determine the value of putting it back in the bundle. So we continue to be excited about the product. There are patients who will take oral. There are patients who will take an injectable, and we'll see how many patients we can assist with both products. As regards Repatha, there's very little usage at the moment on the monthly dose. We have not had a patient-friendly dose up until now. There appear to be a fair amount of patients who would prefer to have a convenient once-a-month dose. And we're spending quite a bit of time talking to cardiologists about this, and we'll be coming to market in the next couple of weeks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citigroup. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. So I have a question for David. On M&A, a lot of questions we're getting across the board in biotech on M&A. How are you thinking about how competitive this space is right now for M&A given that many players are thinking about \u2013 talking about actually buying things? Do you find the space competitive? And how do you think about timelines? Are people being more realistic about valuations? Thanks. David W. Meline - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, so I think what I would say about M&A right now is indeed, first of all, we've been consistent in indicating that we have a broad set of interests, in particular around the six therapeutic areas where we're particularly focused. And so we've said that we're open to look at transactions that could range from early to late-stage. And I think the point is we want to make sure we see everything that might be of interest to us, and I think we're seeing that, first of all. Certainly, we're in a financial position to be able to be competitive. And then secondly, it's true. We're not the only people out there who are in the market looking for opportunities. So I think the point for us is we need to make sure that we first of all look at things as to the scientific insight that we can bring to bear, including with our insight from a human genetic perspective. And then secondly, we are very clear that we're going to be disciplined in terms of the financial returns that we can expect. And we're interested in doing deals that will create returns for Amgen, not just the seller. So we continue to be active and we've got a number of pretty interesting prospects that we think could come to closure, including still this year. Operator : Your next question come from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much for taking the question, just a two-part question on biosimilars and then government effects. So could you talk a little bit about how the proposed Part B changes might play out and potentially affect your business? And secondly, how might that alter the landscape for some of the biosimilars that you're developing or influence that? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : So let me take that one, if I can. This is Tony. Clearly, Amgen has raised some strong objections and questions to the proposed pilot together with about at least 300 other organizations. The concern is always when you do something based on acquisition cost around an ASP adjustment, are you ensuring that patient safety and patient concerns are included? So it's difficult to make a comment at the moment, Geoff, about something that's not been put into place yet. It's a proposal. It's up there for comment, and we're working with other people to make sure that if there is a change, patients are protected all the way through. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC : Hey, Arvind. Do you actually like Ronny Gal? Because I've known him for years and we should chat. Hey, I had a question for \u2013 I love Ronny, by the way. It's a total joke. This was touched on here and there, but your margin guidance, David, goes through 2018. We're now dangerously close to 2017. I understand you can't give us any guidance. But can you just talk to us about your latest thoughts qualitatively about where margins could go after the plan that you've announced? Should we expect further modest margin expansion? Should we be modeling something right along the lines of what you're doing now? Just anything like that, I'd love to hear you riff on that. And then, Bob, what's your appetite for an at-risk Humira biosimilar launch? And, Sean, I'd just be curious real fast to get your opinion. You guys have a CETP. I'd love to know what your opinion on that class is now, just like 30 seconds. Thank you. David W. Meline - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So on the first one on the margin, the margin walk for the company, I would say, as we've been seeing, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made towards the goals we've set out for ourselves in 2018. So you look at the combination of continued growth of the business, you look at the progress we're making, which by the end of this year we expect to be delivering a $1.1 billion improvement on our cost base versus 2013, and we see us certainly achieving the $1.5 billion goal that we set out. Likewise, if you look at the progress on the margins where we started at a 38% margin in 2013, you've now seen us this quarter again deliver over 50% on the way to 52% to 54%. So first of all, I'd say we're pleased with the progress. We're running the company in an agile and efficient manner while still investing significantly for the long-term health of the business. The second point I'd make is, we're exactly as of midyear 2016, now we're halfway through the period through 2018. And quite frankly, while we're making very good progress, I think it would be a mistake for us to take our eye off the ball, to continue to focus on delivering against those goals that we've set out for the company. So first and foremost, we're looking at delivering on those goals. And in due course we'll be looking then in terms of the financial performance beyond that. But I think the important point is we think we've got a business that's sustainably delivering very good performance financially and investing in the innovation and long-term pipeline for the company. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sean, do you want to briefly comment on CETP? Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: Sure. I think at this point in the game, most folks are really just waiting now to see the Merck CETP study read out. I assume midyear next year is what we've most recently heard. Before making any final judgments, I would say that the Lilly data did cause folks who were believers in the mechanism to take significant pause. And certainly, what we've done is to suspend any investment in this area until we see the Merck data. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And, Mark, it won't surprise you to know that we're not going to comment on your question about our launch plans for Humira, as I said earlier on the call. The next step is for us to get regulatory approval for our molecule, and that's what we're focused on securing. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Just to make sure that we don't exceed the one hour of our allocated time here, may I request that you limit yourself to just one question so we can get through everybody's questions? DeMarcus, let's go ahead with next one please. Operator : Yes, your next question is from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks for sneaking me in there, just a question for Tony. How should we think about the launch of yet another oral in the RA market? Are there any parallels to your experiences with an oral in psoriasis and the impact it's had on Enbrel sales there? Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : So the first launch of an oral was obviously not that successful. The launch into psoriasis was interesting because it expanded the marketplace and brought into the market a number of patients who perhaps were earlier in their disease, who weren't quite ready yet to move on to any injectable biologic. It's quite possible that there are a bunch of patients between methotrexate and a biologic that could become eligible for this opportunity. But if you look even in psoriasis, the overall market for the TNFs have remained, just the overall market has grown. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Ying, are you there? Maybe you have us on mute. Okay, let's go on to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Great, thanks very much for taking the question. I was wondering if there is any difference in the dynamics for share loss to a NEUPOGEN biosimilar in the 340B hospital setting versus \u2013 the 340B (55:20) setting. Or if you can, discuss a little bit how the dynamics there might differ between those two. Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Again, sorry, Josh, it was... Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : I think you were talking about the difference between PHS [Public Health Service] and non-PHS, right? Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Correct. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : Clearly I think anyone who's come new into the market has gone off to non-PHS hospitals first. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): What share is PHS? Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : I couldn't give you that offhand. It's tough to pull that type of data just offhand here. If we need to, we'll come back to you on that one. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Looks like Ying is still absent. Okay, let's go on to the next one. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Skorney with Robert W. Baird. Neena Bitritto-Garg - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, this is Neena on for Brian. So I had a question about omecamtiv. I know you said that the Phase 3 protocol has been submitted, but we were just wondering what the gating factors are to starting a Phase 3 trial, just because we know the Phase 2 data has been out for a while now. So are there regulatory issues or something like that that's holding it up, or something else? Sean E. Harper - Executive Vice President-Research & Development: What I would say is that we have been moving aggressively with this program. We had to of course go through some meaningful discussions with regulators around things like the dosing algorithms that would be used, safety of the product, and so on because of the fact that just based on the mechanism and there is a narrow therapeutic window for the product, and when we're assessing drug levels and how the titration scheme. So that's moved along. I think we've been able to design a very robust study and have decided that we should put it through the Special Protocol Assessment at FDA. So things are actually moving along as fast as I would have expected to on a complex program like this. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : As it's getting close to 6 PM on the East Coast markets, let's take two more questions. Operator : Okay, your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. My question is about indication-based pricing in anti-TNF and the broader anti-inflammatory market. How do you guys think about this? Is this good, is this bad? Will it impact Enbrel in a positive way, maybe willing participants or less so, to see if you could give some color. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : It's Tony. Let me respond to that one as best I can. First of all, Amgen has been really at the forefront of innovative solutions to improve patient access, including innovative contracting such as outcomes-based and risk-based contracting. We are partnering with payers on patient-centered approaches to ensure that patients get access to the best available medications, and that physicians make the right choice for the right patient, and at the same time the patient share of cost is manageable. As regards indication-specific contracts, I think it's too early at this stage to actually give any comment about what the impact could be. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about pricing as well. I'm really curious on how we should be thinking about the sustainability of price increases in this environment. More specifically, when thinking about Enbrel and the four meaningful increases you've had in the last couple years, I assume you're not getting much pushback at the payer level to be able to push these through. But are you comfortable with us modeling this pace of increases to continue, as I think many were assuming this would tail off across the space given the rhetoric that's out there? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Executive VP-Global Commercial Operations : So, Cory, again, a question that a lot of people are asking I'm sure. But as you know, we price our products based on the value in the marketplace, taking into account the value they bring to payers, to providers, to patients, the competitive landscape itself. Enbrel in particular of course competes in a highly competitive marketplace with several large players who are competing for formulary placements to enable patient access. The health plans and the PBMs negotiate price concessions and large rebates to gain formulary placement. Because of the magnitude of these rebates, price increases have become part of the competitive dynamic. That's about all I can tell you at the moment. Arvind K. Sood - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Tony. I'd like to also thank everybody for your participation in our call. As you go through our results, if you have added questions, observations, feel free to reach out to me. Myself and my team will be around for several hours. Thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Amgen's second quarter financial results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Nick Abbott - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : My name is Jake and I'll be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to ensure everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Jake. Good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to welcome you to our Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. I would like to begin today by wishing Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Evercore, who, as many of you might know is on medical leave, I'd like to wish him a speedy recovery. And also welcome John Scotti, who's covering the large cap biotech companies in Mark's absence. Also in acknowledging those who are new in the coverage, I'd like to welcome Carter Gould of UBS, who will be initiating coverage of the sector and our company. So our performance during the quarter is best characterized by considerable operating leverage, as earnings growth well exceeded revenue growth. We successfully executed on our lifecycle management strategies for older products while continuing to make efforts to make our new product launches a success. To discuss our performance in greater detail, I'm joined today by Bob Bradway, our Chairman and CEO, who will make some introductory comments. Our CFO, David Meline, will then review our quarterly results and update you on our guidance for 2016. Following David, our head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will discuss our product performance during the quarter, followed by our head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. We should have plenty of time for Q&A after Sean's comments. As in the past, we will use slides for our presentation today, which have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by email. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful to understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results, and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release, the Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website. So just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements and our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Arvind. Our businesses performed well through the first nine months of the year and we continue to make progress in delivering our strategy for long-term growth. At the heart of our strategy is innovation. And as you can see, once again in the third quarter, we enjoyed strong unit volume growth for a number of our newer innovative products, including Prolia, XGEVA, Sensipar, Vectibix, and Nplate. As international expansion is an important objective for us, it's worth noting as well that our unit volumes grew 12% outside of the U.S. And with respect to that 12%, recognize that the competition for our legacy products began much earlier outside of the U.S. than inside, so what you see in this number is the strong demand for our new innovative medicines emerging internationally. Our transformation program, which we announced over two years ago, is foundational for our long-term objectives. And we've achieved momentum in that effort as evidenced in this quarter's results, with operating leverage across all of our business enabling us to grow earnings well ahead of revenues and deliver a nearly 53% operating margin. And just as importantly, the transformation is improving our agility, which shows up in our ability to move a program like erenumab to market ahead of the competition and in our ability to rapidly adapt to changing demands in the marketplace as we've done in the dialysis market with our long-acting Aranesp. I've said for some time that the strength of our legacy franchises is reflected in our durable cash flows. This quarter, we generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow. Stable cash flow like this enables us to invest for the long-term, both internally and externally, while at the same time returning significant cash to our shareholders. We continue to invest globally in the long-term success of our newly launched products, which we expect will generate meaningful revenues over time. In cardiovascular, the Phase III results from our recent Repatha coronary imaging study constitute one more success in our clinical development program for this molecule. This study demonstrates the powerful effect of Repatha on atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries, the major underlying cause of cardiovascular disease and the leading cause of death worldwide. This is especially impressive considering that these results were generated on top of maximized statin therapy. Cardiovascular outcomes data, which are expected in the first quarter next year, will obviously be important for Repatha and should definitively establish the importance of this therapy for those at risk of cardiovascular disease. In oncology, the Neulasta Onpro Kit continues to impress the doctors in the marketplace, and this has proven to be a very successful launch. Multiple myeloma is a rapidly changing field where we've proven KYPROLIS to be the superior proteasome inhibitor for relapsed multiple myeloma patients. We're focused on growing KYPROLIS in this important segment around the world, and early launch results in Europe are encouraging, especially in Germany. With respect to our innovative pipeline, our focus remains on addressing unmet medical needs with innovative medicines that make a big difference for patients. Our next wave of new medicines is set to do just that. In neuroscience, we've already reported successful pivotal studies with our migraine medicine, erenumab, in both chronic and episodic migraine. This is a potentially life-changing medicine for migraine sufferers, and we're pleased to be in the lead position in the CGRP class. Rounding out our franchise in bone health, we recently shared more clinical data on novel bone-building agent, romosozumab. Experts in the field are excited about the potential of romosozumab, and we look forward to our PDUFA date in July. In biosimilars, AMJEVITA, which is of course our biosimilar to adalimumab, is our first approval among the many biosimilar programs that we expect will help generate long-term growth at Amgen. As you know, we're in litigation with AbbVie over AMJEVITA, and it's safe to say that there will be more litigation before there's a launch. Given the pace of that litigation, it's unlikely that this matter will be clarified in time for us to launch in 2017. We've also successfully completed Phase III studies in two more biosimilars and look forward to their regulatory process. While talking about R&D, I want to say also a few words about the healthcare debate in the United States. I think it's obvious that this debate is not going to dissipate any time soon and that all of us in the community must work together to find more affordable healthcare solutions. But as we seek to do that, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that it's the economic and societal burden of disease that is the enemy. Innovative biopharmaceutical drugs offer the promise of addressing that burden. We're at the dawn of a very exciting era for innovation. We see that today in cancer, we see it in cardiovascular medicine, and I think we'll see it in Alzheimer's and other devastating illnesses as well. But if we're to advance promising new medicines, we'll have to do that with an eye to both the price and the value of these therapies. And we must do it in a way that maintains the role of physicians in making the best decisions for patients. We price our products to offer a strong value proposition for patients, payers and providers. We believe the differentiated efficacy of our products enables us to take a leading role in our industry in structuring value-based partnerships for our medicines. We accept that our products need to deliver clear benefit for our customers and accept that we shouldn't be rewarded when they do not. We have value-based contracts in place with a number of payers already and expect to do more. While the regulatory environment is complex in this area today, making each individual contract challenging and time consuming to put in place, we would expect to see more and more value-based contracts arise as one of the ways of enabling more patients to gain access to the right innovative medicines for their ailments at the right time. We don't have all the solutions obviously at Amgen, but we're committed to working with others to address challenges and improve the short- and long-term health of our society as a whole. Shifting gears. We have a strong balance sheet and the flexibility and willingness to invest in external innovation. We're active in our review of opportunities, principally in our core therapeutic categories, and we're disciplined as to the price that we'll pay for assets. Of late, we've seen better opportunities to create value with earlier-stage assets. For example, in immuno-oncology, which is of course a focus area for us, we expanded our arsenal during the quarter with a collaboration with Advaxis as well as through the re-acquisition of a BiTE molecule to the BCMA target for multiple myeloma from Boehringer Ingelheim. We also expanded our cardiovascular franchise with an early-stage collaboration with Arrowhead. Wrapping up, I'd offer that the long-term prospects of our business are bright. And I want to thank our teams around the world for their continuing focus on serving patients. David? David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the third quarter financial results on page six of the slide deck, revenues at $5.8 billion grew 2% year-over-year. This quarter we saw steady product sales performance anniversarying against the strong third quarter comparison last year. Other revenues at $295 million increased $88 million versus the third quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited primarily from milestone payments, notably, a milestone received related to the approval of KYPROLIS in Japan. Changes in foreign exchange had less than a 1% negative impact to total revenue and product sales in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating income at $2.9 billion grew 9% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by over 4 points to 52.9% for the quarter, reflecting continued revenue performance and favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales improved by 0.5 points to 13%, driven by manufacturing efficiencies and higher net selling price, partially offset by product mix. Research and development expenses at $963 million decreased by 11% versus last year, driven primarily by lower spending required to support certain late-stage clinical programs and transformation and process improvement efforts, partially offset by increases in upfront payments for several in-licensing transactions. SG&A expenses increased 1% on a year-over-year basis, as increased commercial investments in new product launches, primarily in international markets, were enabled by savings from transformation and process improvement efforts. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 5% year-over-year. Other income and expenses were a net $109 million expense in Q3. This is favorable by $38 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year favorability was primarily due to gains in the third quarter from rebalancing our investment portfolio. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.9% for the quarter, a 0.9 point increase versus Q3 of 2015. This increase reflects unfavorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings, offset by the benefit of the federal R&D credit in 2016. Non-GAAP net income increased 9% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 11% year-over-year. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page seven. Free cash flow was $2.5 billion for the quarter compared to free cash flow of $2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2015. We deployed $0.7 billion to repurchase 4.4 million shares in the quarter. Our year-to-date repurchases now total $2 billion at an average of $157 per share. We continue to plan on repurchases of up to $3 billion in total this year. Additionally, our third quarter dividend was $1 per share, an increase of 27% over last year. In October 2016, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the share repurchase authorization to $5 billion. Cash and investments totaled $38 billion, an increase of approximately $7 billion from last year's third quarter level. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow and the net effect of the third quarter debt issuance. Our debt balance stands at $35.3 billion as of September 30. Our total debt portfolio has a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of 12 years. Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2016 on page eight. We remain on track with our plans to continue investing to grow the business, while transforming to a more agile and efficient operating model. Today we are increasing our 2016 guidance, which reflects continued conviction in executing our strategy and business performance through the first three quarters of this year. As a reminder, we expect to see an increase in operating expenses in Q4 versus Q3, reflecting the typical pattern for the business. With respect to our updated guidance, our 2016 revenue guidance is now $22.6 billion to $22.8 billion versus prior guidance of $22.5 billion to $22.8 billion. And our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is now $11.40 to $11.55 per share, versus prior guidance of $11.10 to $11.40. Finally, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20% and capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year. In summary, our performance in 2016 remains on track. In this regard, we will be providing 2017 guidance in our January call. We continued to be on track to meet our commitments through 2018 based on our balanced portfolio of launch, growth and legacy products, along with steady progress in expenses due to our transformation efforts. This concludes the financial update. I'd like to turn the call over now to Tony. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Thank you, David. And you'll find the summary of our performance for the third quarter on slide number 10. Our total revenues increased 2% year-over-year as we continue to drive strong volume growth, as Bob said, across several important brands, including Prolia, Sensipar, XGEVA, Nplate, and Vectibix. And we're bringing in our new products, notably KYPROLIS and REPATHA, to more patients in more markets. These gains were offset by declines in our legacy products, primarily due to competition, along with the negative impact in changes in inventory levels. In the U.S., our product sales declined 1% year-over-year and internationally product sales grew 4%, or 7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This performance was fueled by 12% of volume growth. Let me start with an update on how we're executing the lifecycle management strategies across our mature brands, beginning with Neulasta. Neulasta treats cancer patients who are at risk of febrile neutropenia. Each year around 100,000 patients in the U.S. are hospitalized due to potentially fatal febrile neutropenia. Not only are these hospitalizations costly to our healthcare system and potentially devastating to patients, but they also result in potential excessive use of broad spectrum antibiotics, which can contribute to hospital-based antibiotic resistance. This is a prime example of how innovative medicines can deliver value to the healthcare system. Year-over-year Neulasta declined 5% due to a small segment contraction in the U.S., along with increased competition in our international business. We continue to see strong performance from our Onpro delivery kit in the U.S. and are on track to exit 2016 at close to 50% market share. The Onpro delivery kit is a clear example of our commitment to innovation to improve the quality of patient care throughout the product lifecycle. Onpro improves the patient experience by eliminating the need to return to a doctor's office the day after chemotherapy for a Neulasta injection. This translates to increased value for providers, patients and payers. We expect adoption of this device to continue. The short-acting filgrastim market in the U.S. continued to behave as expected, with the entrance of a short-acting biosimilar in September last year. NEUPOGEN declined 36% year-over-year, mainly due to this competition. We continue to compete account-by-account and hold 35% (19:26) of the short-acting market as we exit the third quarter. Turning to our ESA business. Aranesp increased 8% year-over-year, mainly due to growth in the U.S. dialysis segment. We have successfully transitioned over 80% of the ESA use in independent and mid-sized dialysis centers from EPOGEN to Aranesp. We don't expect much further transition to Aranesp moving forward. EPOGEN declined 31% year-over-year. The largest driver was conversion to Mircera by Fresenius, which began in earnest in the fourth quarter of 2015. We don't expect a short-acting biosimilar entrant until late next year at the earliest. Now to ENBREL, where segment growth remains strong at both rheumatology and dermatology. Our primary focus is in rheumatology, which represents in excess of 80% of our business, where ENBREL offers a very competitive efficacy and safety profile as well as a strong economic value. ENBREL sales were unchanged year-over-year, driven by several factors. Firstly, volume decline due to increased competition. Sequentially on a value basis, we maintained share in rheumatology and lost 1 percentage point to dermatology. Competition in these segments continues to intensify. Secondly, we experienced a negative impact from changes in inventory levels. Both of these dynamics were offset by positive changes in net selling price. You'll recall that changes in net selling price comprise several components, including changes to list price as well as impacts from rebates we provide to payers, including those related to their formulary decisions. ENBREL is another example of our focus on innovation, where we continue to pursue additional indications, including one for children suffering from chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. We're also investing in novel delivery systems to help patients with chronic inflammatory diseases to more effectively and efficiently inject themselves and ensure optimal therapy over the treatment period. We will continue to compete on a payer contracting basis to maximize patient access to ENBREL. In highly competitive markets, PBMs can require incremental rebates from us in order for us to maintain our formulary positioning. Maintaining our formulary positioning is essential to ensure patients have access to a drug like ENBREL, which has the longest in-market history of efficacy and safety. Given this dynamic and present contract negotiations, we expect relatively little benefit from net selling price changes in 2017. Sensipar grew 18% year-over-year, driven by net selling price and strong unit growth globally. We look forward to passage of the European approval and are working with the FDA to obtain our approval in the U.S. Prolia delivered strong growth of 18% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, we saw the typical seasonality in quarter three, with a decline of 14%. Prolia remains an important growth driver and we continue to invest to realize its full potential. Volume growth continued at nearly 20% in both the U.S. and the E.U., as we continue to capture share across these markets. XGEVA showed continued volume growth of about 7% year on year, and we were pleased to see the recent result of the successful Phase III trial with XGEVA in multiple myeloma. About half the patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma will develop renal impairment, limiting the options for skeletal-related events. We look forward to bringing XGEVA to these patients who, until recently, had no other option. Vectibix and Nplate continue to deliver double-digit growth, driven mainly by volume gains. Vectibix also benefited this quarter from shipments to our Japanese partner, which can fluctuate throughout the year. Let me now turn to our launch products, and those would be REPATHA and KYPROLIS. Both products represent substantial opportunities, as they address serious diseases with significant unmet needs. Starting with our cardiovascular franchise, Corlanor helped us to establish our presence in the cardiovascular space and better understand the cardiology community. Corlanor was approved to prevent re-hospitalization, one of the single largest costs in the healthcare system, and thus offers a strong value proposition for chronic heart failure patients. It has also now been included in the Heart Failure Guidelines. Nonetheless, Corlanor sales have been modest to-date, as it faces steep payer hurdles. We do not expect a dramatic change in this trend in the near future. As for REPATHA, we are working with payers and providers to allow unlabeled patient access. We've seen minor improvements in the utilization and management criteria but high hurdles remain for both physicians and patients to gain access. We are very pleased with the REPATHA GLAGOV results, which Sean will discuss in a moment. We believe that GLAGOV along with the expected positive outcomes data from the FOURIER study in the first quarter 2017 will certainly strengthen REPATHA's value proposition. We look forward to having these data included in our label. Now to KYPROLIS. KYPROLIS grew 34% year-over-year as we see strong early uptake from key markets in Europe combined with continued growth in the U.S. In Europe, KYPROLIS grew 30% year-over-year. Multiple myeloma is a dynamic market, with the entrance of new competitors. In the U.S., we lost some share in the third-line plus as a result of these new entrants. However, we expect proteasome inhibition to remain foundational therapy and we continue to grow and generate volume growth in second line as this segment grows and patients are treated longer. We are focused on growing a second line based on the strong ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data. Both regimens, the triplet and the doublet, have been recognized as preferred regimens for second-line treatment in the recently updated NCCN guidelines. Let me close by thanking our customer-facing teams around the world. Their focus and agility to continue delivering for patients in this highly dynamic environment is inspirational. Let me now pass it to Sean. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. We've continued to make very good progress in the third quarter, with numerous regulatory and pipeline milestones. I'll begin my review with cardiovascular. In September, we received results from our intravascular ultrasound study in patients with coronary artery disease on intensive statin therapy with primary and secondary end points for men. From a scientific standpoint, the clear demonstration of a link between the PCSK9 mechanism of action in lowering LDL cholesterol and a reduction in atherosclerotic plaque burden in patients already treated with intensive statin therapy is truly groundbreaking. We look forward to the presentation of these results at the American Heart Association Meetings in New Orleans on November 15, where we will also be hosting an investor event. We're on track to review the results from our cardiovascular outcomes study in the first quarter of next year and anticipate having the data in time for presentation at the American College of Cardiology Annual Meeting in March. In heart failure, we've reached agreement with the FDA on the key elements of our omecamtiv mecarbil Phase III cardiovascular outcome study through a special protocol assessment. The study will enroll approximately 8,000 chronic heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction with a primary end point of time to cardiovascular death or first heart failure event. We're finalizing some of the details of the protocol with global regulators and anticipate enrolling patients early next year. Omecamtiv is being developed in collaboration with Cytokinetics and Servier. In earlier stage cardiovascular programs, we recently announced the licensing and collaboration agreements with Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals to develop and commercialize R&A interference therapies for Lp(a) and another undisclosed target. Lp(a) is a target we have gained great confidence in through advanced genetic analysis performed at deCODE. We have also recently entered the clinic with exciting new molecule for heart failure. And our ASGR1 program in atherosclerosis continues to move forward in the pre-clinical phase. Turning to oncology, I'll begin with KYPROLIS. In Q3, we received the results of the CLARION study, which we had the opportunity to discuss at length in our conference call. I would stress that we are committed to advancing KYPROLIS into first-line therapy and we're close to finalizing a study design focused on the combination of KYPROLIS, Revlimid and dexamethasone in transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, where we have seen very encouraging data from large investigator sponsored studies. In fact, today many of the thought leaders in the field consider KRd the standard of care for first-line patients. We're also exploring other combination studies, including with some of the newer therapies. And we're currently in discussions with Janssen to co-fund the study of carfilzomib in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. We're also currently supplying drug to Janssen for their Phase Ib dose finding combination study. Before leaving KYPROLIS, I'm pleased to report we completed enrollment in the Phase III study of weekly administration in the third-line setting and expect those results next year. We're also advancing the reformulated oprozomib molecule into the clinic in order to rapidly and definitively assess the potential to develop an oral proteasome inhibitor with a benefit/risk profile that would be superior to existing oral proteasome therapy. We recently had the opportunity to review the results of the study of XGEVA in the prevention of bone complications in the multiple myeloma population. And we're pleased to report the study met its primary end point of non-inferiority to zoledronic acid in the time to first skeletal-related events. This was expected. The efficacy was similar between the agents. But in addition, the renal safety profile, particularly important in the multiple myeloma population, favored the XGEVA arm. Recall that XGEVA is not currently indicated for the prevention of skeletal-related events in the multiple myeloma population, and we look forward to discussing label updates with global regulators. In our immuno-oncology program, BLINCYTO, our CD19 BiTE, continues to make a meaningful impact on the lives of certain ALL patients. And in 3Q, the FDA expanded the indication to include the pediatric setting. The addition of a novel immunotherapy, like BLINCYTO, is an important advance for these patients, where the use of cytotoxic chemotherapies can lead to long-term consequences, such as secondary malignancies. We're also initiating several Phase III studies of BLINCYTO in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, including our previously announced combination study with Merck's PD-1 inhibitor, KEYTRUDA. As we investigate the potential for IMLYGIC in combination with other immunotherapies, we've recently had the opportunity to present encouraging data from an interim analysis of our Phase II study of IMLYGIC in combination with Yervoy at the European Cancer meetings, ESMO. In summary, the data suggests that the combination of IMLYGIC and Yervoy has greater efficacy than either agent alone in stage IIIB, IV melanoma patients without any additional safety burden. This study is expected to complete later this year and will be submitted for presentation at the Medical Meeting in 2017. Our combinations of studies of IMLYGIC with the anti-PD-1 antibody, KEYTRUDA. continue to enroll. We also re-acquired the rights to AMG 420, a Phase I BiTE construct directed against B cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, a multiple myeloma target that had been licensed to Boehringer Ingelheim prior to our acquisition of Micromet. And finally, we announced a pre-clinical collaboration with Advaxis on a unique, innovative and bespoke approach to generating immune responses against patient-specific tumor neo antigens. In our bone health programs, a Phase III study of Prolia compared with Risedronate in patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment met all primary and secondary end points. Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is a small and medically important indication for men and women, often under the care of rheumatologists, and we will discuss a label update with regulators soon. Last month, data from the romosozumab Phase III placebo control fracture study, FRAME, was presented at the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Feedback from the bone community was very positive and there's a clear desire for new innovative anabolic therapies for the treatment of osteoporosis. FDA has accepted our romosozumab file and, along with our partners at UCB, we look forward to continued interactions as we work toward our July 2017 PDUFA date. We also expect to conduct the primary analysis of the Phase III active control fracture study, ARCH, in the first half of next year. In neuroscience, we continue to advance our CGRP receptor antibody, erenumab, for migraine prophylaxis in collaboration with Novartis. We successfully completed the first of two Phase III studies in the episodic migraine setting. 70 milligrams of subcutaneous erenumab administered monthly resulted in a statistically and clinically significant reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days, with a safety profile similar to placebo. We'll see the results of the second Phase III study in episodic migraine by the end of this year. We also presented the positive results from our Phase IIB chronic migraine study at the European Headache and Migraine Trust International Congress. This was a robust study of more than 650 patients experiencing 18 migraine days per month at baseline. And we believe the results of this study combined with our two Phase III studies in episodic migraine could support registration for both chronic and episodic migraine indications. In nephrology, Parsabiv received a positive opinion in Europe for the prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adults with chronic kidney disease on dialysis, and we look forward to receiving market authorization in the EU. In the U.S., we are working with FDA toward an approval. Finally, we received our first biosimilar approval in Q3 for AMJEVITA, our biosimilar HUMIRA, which was approved in all eligible indications of the referenced product. We also began enrolling Phase III studies for our biosimilar rituximab, ABP 798, in both rheumatoid arthritis and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and our biosimilar infliximab, ABP 710, in rheumatoid arthritis. As we move toward the end of the year, we still have some important work ahead of us. And as always, I'd like to thank our staff for their efforts to combat serious disease. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Sean. We'd like to open the call up now to questions, and I'd ask our operator just to remind everybody what the procedure is for asking questions. And with that, let's turn it over to your questions. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two for me. First, Bob, I was just wondering, if there is a repatriation agreement under a new administration, just wondering if you could help frame for us maybe some potential uses of your cash. And then, Sean, was wondering on the IVUS data that we'll see, can you just help us think about potential implications for the ongoing CV outcomes trial with respect to potential effect size? Is there any correlation there? Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for your question. Why don't actually I ask David to address your question on repatriation? Obviously, you know we're supportive of corporate tax reform and, in particular, reform that would enable us to think about that cash. But, David, why don't you address the question? And we'll have Sean talk about IVUS. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, certainly. So, yeah, I think the first point of course is that we continue to generate very solid and stable cash flow for the business. And what we've seen thus far is that we're able to fund all of the requirements of the business without having to repatriate the cash and pay a current (37:17) very unfavorable tax rate. So I think the point is, should we see tax reform in the U.S., would we consider to repatriate the cash? I would say yes. And what we'd look at would be, first, to maintain the lowest weighted average cost of capital for the company. And that could involve repaying some of the debt that we have on the balance sheet, but maintaining a pretty healthy net debt position for the company. And then we'd look at certainly deploying cash, as Bob was saying, towards external opportunities. But in that instance, we would certainly lead with, are there strategic opportunities that make sense where we could get a return to our own shareholders from such investments? And then finally, we'd look at potentially buying back shares to, again, get to the right and balanced weighted average cost of capital. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, with regard to the IVUS results and reading them through to see the outcomes, there's obviously no formula for that. What I would say is that the scientific hypothesis behind the program is that we would see a similar impact on atherosclerotic disease and hence outcome measures from lowering LDL by a given amount with this mechanism, as we would if we did it with a statin. And obviously here, patients are already maxed-out on statin therapy and you're doing something you otherwise couldn't do, which is to lower LDL substantially beyond that. But the hypothesis would be that you would see a reduction in the impact of atherosclerotic disease that would be generally similar because the mechanisms are very similar. And I think that the positive IVUS study increases one's confidence about that hypothesis substantially. As you know, the human genetics, which we tend to focus on a lot here at Amgen, were very strongly indicative of that already, but the IVUS data give us much more confidence. So I generally expect to see something that's generally similar to what you might expect to see if you were reducing LDL in the PCSK9 outcomes trial, were it possible to do so on top of existing maxed-out statin therapy with the statin. So that's kind of how I think about that. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Jake, let's take the next question. And just a gentle reminder that if you can please limit yourself to just one question. That way, we can be sure that we get to everybody's questions. Let's go on with the next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the question. If I can ask two related questions on ENBREL. Hopefully that doesn't get in Arvind's way. So first, Tony, you talked about expected little benefit from net selling prices in 2017. I'm wondering if you can just expand on that and tell if there's a certain amount of price increase that you're expecting when you make that comment or if the contracts you've written has certain price protections where no matter how much list price you take, you won't see much net price. And then just related to that, can you tell us exactly what the dollar amount of the inventory headwind was in the third quarter? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So let me start with the first one first. The inventory was about $108 million worth of differential. From the net selling price, obviously, we've never given product-specific price guidance and/or the contracts themselves are confidential. But clearly, my statement around there will be little impact on net selling price changes is indicative of we'll be driving the business on volume, not on net selling price, next year. Jake, let's go on to the next one. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Eric Schmidt, Ph.D. - Cowen & Co. LLC: To follow up on that same topic for Tony, are you suggesting that you've been able to contract in I guess a better way in terms of volumes and that we won't continue to see the mid to high-single digit volume erosions for ENBREL that we've seen over the course of this year? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: No. Volume is always driven by demand in the marketplace. What I'm saying is the contract does say it will result in little impact on net selling price. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang of Jefferies. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Question on AMG 820. You had this product in development for a while, but it was quiet until you did the deal with the collaboration with Merck. So I want to ask you, wanted to see your view on anti CSF-1R (42:34) potentially an IO combination and what tumor types you think would benefit the most from this combination. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Well, so this is, of course, for people who aren't \u2013 not the cognoscenti in this area, it's an antibody that would address the role of tumor macrophages in maintaining a micro environment for tumors. There's a lot of very non-causal indirect evidence to suggest that those macrophages do play an important role into regenesis and maintaining surveillance, abating surveillance in the immune system. So it's I think a very interesting target and something that one could imagine being synergistic with checkpoint inhibition. There are, of course, tumor types that tend to have much more infiltration of these macrophages and where you can demonstrate, in fact, that prognosis is related to an individual patient by the numbers or density of these infiltrating macrophages. So we tended to focus on some of those tumor types. I wouldn't necessarily get into on this call exactly what tumor types we're exploring because we're in early stages so we're looking at lots of different tumor types in mixed population studies. It's a very interesting program. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks for the question. For Sean, I wanted to ask on romo, now that you've presented more data and it seems to be well on progress, the importance of the upcoming active controlled study. What's your expectation for what happens there and the importance of it in the regulatory filing, presuming the FDA would want to see it? And do you think the regulatory decision is an efficacy question or a safety question? And how do you think about what's going on there? Thanks so much. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Right. So from a regulatory perspective, there's absolutely no requirement for such a study. A placebo controlled fracture trial, large placebo controlled fracture trial that meets the guidances that exist in this field is sufficient for registration all over the world. So we've made a strategic decision to file in some parts of the world with both studies. And that has to do with payer access determinations and so on. But I think that you are right that, of course, any time we do studies on our products, regulators are interested to see them, mainly to be \u2013 and we often are interested in getting those changes into the label or their interested in them from the safety perspective and so on. I think that one thing we have to recognize is that this study is designed to be analyzed first based on a time-driven basis. And that's what we're talking about when we talk about the primary analysis that comes in the first half of next year. And then because we never are sure about the event rate that we're going to experience in these kind of trials, there's an event-driven analysis, for example for non-vertebral fracture, which would come later if we don't hit it based on the time-based analysis. So that's important to understand. And then finally, I would say that this is a very high hurdle. No one's done an active controlled fracture trial like this before that's actually powered and designed to actually show fracture results from the get-go. And it produces a high hurdle. It was our feeling that we needed to be able to demonstrate that the product could be superior to a strategy of using alendronate. And so that's the idea behind having this second study, largely again to work with payers. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you very much. And I'm sorry I keep persisting on this ENBREL question, but this quarter revenue was obviously flat. You did have the one-time effect, but units were down 7%. And you commented that if you look at year-over-year, list price was up 26% or so, or certainly above 20%. So are we to assume then that your list price increase is more or less completely given up in the contract that you're now engaged in? And then just related to that, could you give us an example of some of the value-based contracts and how much of your business is involved in such contracts now? I'm just trying to understand what that will mean. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. So, yeah, the details of the contract we're putting out are confidential. But as we think about list prices, next year we will be circumspect, clearly based on the environment. There's a lot of pressure in the highly competitive environment, specifically with anti-TNS, where we have to put large rebates on the table to maintain our formulary position. The large rebates are clearly impacting net selling price. So let me just go back and say that, as we think about 2017, we will see little impact on net selling price for ENBREL. Demand will be driven by what happens in the marketplace and the trends are as they are in terms of the market share at the moment and in terms of the PRXs. As regards some of the value based contracts we have, there is a contract in the Northeast where we've talked about a value-based contract with REPATHA around a guaranteed level of lipid lowering specifically linked to REPATHA and our ability to lower lipids. We have some work ongoing with Corlanor in terms of re-hospitalization. We have some work that's happening both inside the U.S. and outside the U.S. on Prolia in terms of fractures. So those are three examples. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: It total, Geoff, for example, on REPATHA, we're getting up to two handfuls of these contracts. And is said in my remarks, each one of these takes some time to put in place, but I think we're addressing a need in the marketplace and we would expect to continue to see more of these, not just from Amgen but others in the industry, and frankly in other sectors of the healthcare economy as well. So I think we're at a point where consumers, payers, want to pay for what works and not for what doesn't. And so this is one way to address that need in the marketplace. And, again, I think the products that we have, products like Prolia, products like REPATHA, a number of our products give us an opportunity to offer such value-based arrangements in the market. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Schimmer from Piper Jaffray. Joshua E. Schimmer, M.D. - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks for taking my question. I was a little surprised to hear that Corlanor was facing significant reimbursement headwinds. And hoping you can draw a fence around that and help us understand why that's not a harbinger of difficulties and headwinds for REPATHA once you have the cardiovascular (50:28) data in hand for that product? Thank you. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So let me try and answer the question. So the label we eventually got from the FDA for Corlanor was a fairly limited label that pointed to re-hospitalization only. A number of restrictions are in place by the payers. And, of course, Corlanor has been added to the standard of care at the moment. Most of the payers are really trying to work out, do they displace the ACE inhibitor with Entresto at the moment. And then there's a second add on for patients who have heart rates higher than 70 who would then be eligible for Corlanor. So the business to-date has been limited. Access is limited and a fair amount of paperwork is required by physicians and cardiologists to get patients on Corlanor. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: And the other thing just to remember, of course, Josh, is that this product wasn't developed at all the way we've developed REPATHA. And we continue to be very excited about the prospects for REPATHA and the importance of the outcomes data to demonstrate to everybody why lowering LDL cholesterol with this mechanism is important. So we're enthusiastic. We have a set of data for REPATHA that are spectacularly consistent from start to finish and we look forward to adding the outcomes data to that. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Scotti from Evercore ISI. John Scotti - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. Thanks for take my question. And, Arvind, thank you so much for the kind words earlier. I really appreciate it. Thank you. So I want to ask on omecamtiv, actually. Now that you've decided to move to Phase III, Sean, maybe your thoughts on, I guess for everyone, the size of the opportunity, how much would this program cost? And then specifically on the Phase III design, how long do you think it'll take to enroll the trial? Your thoughts. And then as well, your thoughts on the practical feasibility of, my understanding is you need to thread the needle from a PK perspective with regard to any risk of increasing systole duration at high exposure. So how practically do you intend to address that in the Phase III trial? And then just generally, is this an opportunity that you see as the same magnitude as REPATHA or what's your thoughts on the overall size? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: So what I would say, if you step back and look at chronic heart failure, it's right up there on the top of global epidemic disease burden things. So it's a huge unmet need. And if you compare it to an area like oncology, the amount of work that's going on in terms of innovative mechanisms that are directed at heart failure is night and day. There's very little. For example, there's absolutely no competition in the space of something that would be an ionic tropic palliative contractile mechanism like omecamtiv. So I think there's a huge opportunity. And in particular, just from a purely medical perspective, this has been the holy grail in heart failure is to try and get something that actually can increase the efficiency of the squeeze that the living cardiac tissue can provide without increasing myocardial oxygen demand and resulting in arrhythmic death. So we believe, at this point, that we have a very compelling Phase II experience and a lot of very sophisticated human physiologic experiments that we've done to understand how the product is working. We understand it deeply at a molecular level. And I think that the PK is an important feature. And one of the reasons that it's taken us the time it has to get the product into Phase III is that this is kind of classic, really tough, relatively narrow window of small molecule drug development. And we had to come up with a formulation that was well behaved and also a drug testing strategy that can be implemented in the clinic to assess. So we have a titrated regimen where patients get started on a dose, then they get the blood tests to see what level they're at once they're at steady state. And some proportion of patients get increased to a higher dose to ensure that everybody's in a therapeutic range. And I think we've demonstrated very convincingly that we can keep all the patients out of a range where you're getting too much of the mechanism, too much pharmacodynamic effect and not enough relaxation time. So bottom line is, I think it's an extremely important program. And I think that these programs are inherently long term because you can't, unlike REPATHA where we could get at least onto the market with a surrogate, you have to have a mortality, morbidity outcomes trial just to gain market. But I'm very pleased that we are advancing this mechanism and we have a lot of interest in heart failure throughout our whole pipeline. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys. Thank you. So just looking big picture of the company, it looks like product sales been stable for a few quarters, or about four or five quarters. And given the slow uptake of the new products, it looks like a lot of the growth here is being driven by price. How are you thinking about the importance of bringing in some inorganic growth and the magnitude of that inorganic growth, given that the new products are more slow launchers? Thank you. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Robyn, as I said in my remarks, we have a strong balance sheet. I think we have a world-class business development effort. We're looking, and we have been for some time, looking at opportunities. I think it's important particularly in an environment like this to be disciplined about price so that we can earn a return for our shareholders, not just for the target's shareholders. So we'll continue to look. Of late, we have found some very interesting opportunities at the early stages and so we've done a few deals. We've got a few others we're looking at now, but we will continue to look at larger opportunities. And for the most part, Robyn, those will be in our six areas of focus, therapeutic focus. And as we've said now for more than a year, we're looking at a wider range of opportunities than we were previously. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, just can you give us more color on the Onpro kit, maybe what market share you have right now? And also, is the IP different than Neulasta IP? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So this is Tony. Let me answer that one. One, we do have IP on the Onpro kit, so it is actually different to the composition of matter patent, yes. Number two, the average market share for the Onpro in second quarter was about 34%. And we've exited the third quarter at around 44%, 45% as an average. So good growth. And we believe we're on track for close to 30% by the end of the year. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Sanford Bernstein. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you for taking my question. So a little bit on KYPROLIS. The concern out there has been that KYPROLIS was going to get squeezed between the IMiD on one side and dara on the other. So the combination with dara is interesting. I guess the question is, are you thinking about this as a trial that will look at dara plus KYPROLIS against dara plus an IMiD? Or is this just against a single agent? How do you guys make the case that KYPROLIS should be used instead of any one of those two agents? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, I think that what we're thinking about is really if you imagine that a lot of patients will see drugs like an IMiD and potentially VELCADE in earlier lines of therapy, when you get to the relapsed refractory, which is where we're talking about the study with Janssen, at that point you're really looking at, for example, the ENDEAVOR type regimen which is KYPROLIS at a particular dose with dexamethasone. That's where we were able to demonstrate a doubling of PFS versus VELCADE. So that base regimen plus daratumumab versus the regimen alone is what we're thinking about looking at. And you can imagine that this could be an extremely attractive regimen to have KYPROLIS, dex and daratumumab as a relapsed refractory agent available to patients who've been treated with oftentimes drugs like REVLIMID and steroids and VELCADE in the first-line therapy. So I think that's an obvious place for us to look at that kind of combination therapy and that's what we're focused on. In the big picture, I would say that we will be looking \u2013 remember how rapidly moving this field has been in multiple myeloma and how many new entrants have come in place. There's also a potential role for immunotherapy here with the checkpoint inhibitor, so we're doing studies with that. So it's going continue to be a rapidly evolving field. And we remain confident that proteasome inhibition is going be a backbone component of regimens and that because of the limitations that are inherent in trying to treat with a drug that causes the kind of peripheral neuropathy that occurs with pertuzumab will end up playing an important role in treatment regimens for sure. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of questions so far on REPATHA from a cost benefit from a payer perspective. Sean or Tony, I want to get your perspective on erenumab and what you've seen with ARISE and how you view that within the context of cost benefit? And then, Sean, just looking forward for the STRIVE study, could you maybe help us with how that patient population may be different from a placebo response perspective? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So let me answer the first question around cost benefit. We haven't set a price for the product yet. But from what we've seen, it's a huge unmet medical need. A large number of patients who suffer from this disease. It's a debilitating disease that takes away independence and the ability to be productive, to be productive either as a worker or as a mother or a father. The available treatment on the market at the moment does not help patients as much as they'd like. It causes side effects that are sometimes worse than the disease itself. And it's a disease that patients really know about when they have it. It's not a non-observable symptom like some other diseases. Obviously, I think our ability to take away some of these migraines, to allow people to take back their lives will allow us to build pharmaco-economic models that show real value when we come to market. Sean? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, well, in terms of the second Phase III EM study, it's very similar in design. And the inclusion, exclusion criteria are extremely similar to the study that we just saw recently. So I don't think there's any reason to expect big differences in things like the placebo response rate, for example, between the trials. No two trials are going to be identical, but there shouldn't be big differences. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess this is for Bob, and maybe Tony as well. Just curious as to your views on Prop 61 in California and maybe how concerned you are about this type of movement gaining steam and further shaping the overall pricing landscape. Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, Cory. It'd come as no surprise to you to learn that we're opposed to Proposition 61. We think the proposition itself is flawed. And so we are joined in our view by most of the major newspapers in California, a very large number of the veterans groups as well, I think even, frankly, many of the major California public entities have also come out against Proposition 61. So we're working hard to try to make sure that people understand the reasons why we don't think this is in the interest of the citizens of the State of California. Obviously, this is a populist topic at the moment, Cory, so we think it's important to shed light on it here in California and wherever else there might be a similar ballot initiative risk. Because I think fundamentally, what we support, as I described earlier, is the role of innovative biopharmaceuticals to try and address what is the real villain here, which is the economic and social burden of serious disease. And we think innovative therapies are the way to help address that problem. And any initiative that might have the unintended consequences of Proposition 61 could have to the funding of innovative R&D is something we're going to look at very carefully and share our concerns about. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from BofA Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for the question. Two quick ones from me. On a high level, do you guys have any strategic interest in another product like ENBREL in rheumatology and dermatology, given that there is some evolving change of the approach in treating both of these in oral drugs? And then there's another quick one on biosimilar Solaris. Given that it's targeting a very rare disease, is it possible you could actually go through the approval process without testing the drug in patients, just in healthy volunteers? Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Let me take the first one, Ying. Again, it's no surprise that we've looked through the years at a broad number of potential products to treat rheumatologic and dermatologic inflammatory diseases. And we continue to do that. We have a very high bar, obviously, with ENBREL, given the years of safety and efficacy data that we have for that product, but we have and will continue to look at other agents. As you know, we were developing a couple on our own as well. And when those no longer had the opportunity to be first or best in class, we moved out of them. But we'll continue to look for ways to add value in inflammation. That's one of our core research focuses. With respect to your question about our biosimilar program, I don't know - Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, I think that I would be surprised, as this program you're referring to is quite early in its development process in Phase I. But I think there likely would need to be experience in the patient population. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Clearly, the plan we have at the moment will bring us to market at the earliest time possible within the concept of patent laws. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to get your sensory level of commitment for developing biosimilar Eculizumab, just given the amount of visibility we've had on newer branded approaches in the complement space. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Sorry. Say it again, Ian. We couldn't hear at this end which molecule you were talking about. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Eculizumab. Solaris. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: And I didn't hear the question. Unknown Speaker : He's asking... M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah, sorry. Let me... Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: We have a program that we're advancing. You're aware of it, Ian, because of a regulatory filing we made at the time that the trial began, but we haven't said much about our intention for that molecule other than that we intend to take it through development and, as Tony said, have it available as soon as the intellectual property patents have lapsed and enable us to launch it. So if your question is, are we serious about it, do we intend to develop a molecule? Yes. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo. Nick Abbott - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hello. Good afternoon. This is Nick in for Jim this afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Really, it's about the BiTE strategy. Obviously, you've been investing in ALL. You have a Phase II/III study listed in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for continuous infusion. Now you've got the BI product, which is continuous infusion and also subcutaneous administration, I believe. So from one perspective, this could look like this is sub-optimal delivery, but maybe you disagree with that. So can you discuss the BiTE strategy, particularly against targets where they're are fully human BiTE-specific antibodies and cell therapies also being directed at those targets? Thanks. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, I think, first of all, we currently have the ability to develop the very short half-life molecules or much longer half-life versions of these constructs. And we've had that in place for some time now. And so we make choices between those depending on the particular circumstances. Now obviously with the molecule like BLINCYTO that's already approved, the thing that we're doing there is looking at induction regimens where an intensive treatment with an intravenous administration for a limited period of time would be acceptable if we were going to drive people into very low minimal residual disease positive state. But it is true that for many solid tumor settings, for example, the development that we would pursue would be with the half-life extended versions of the BiTE. So in the big picture, it turns out, interestingly, that for some of these molecules when they're being used in hematologic malignancy settings and there's a real potential for these kind of Cytokine Storm Syndromes, the ability to actually turn the drug's infusion off and have it dissipate out of the system in a matter of minutes is a huge advantage. And so that's something that you need to take into account. But we do as we develop these against targets in solid tumors, we ultimately \u2013 and even in settings like lymphoma, you may see us do something with it a short-acting BiTE and then follow in as a sort of next generation with a half-life extended version. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: One thing I might also just add because it relates to a comment I made in my opening remarks about our transformation. But the BiTE area is one where we're moving very rapidly internally in our ability to examine targets and incorporate them into our BiTE platform. And the other thing I would note is we see some significant opportunities from a manufacturing cost standpoint in this area that we're excited about as well, consistent with the look we're doing in our transformation. We think this is an area that has real legs at Amgen. Lets go to the next question. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, Jake, as we're about 15 minutes past the hour, let's take one last question, please. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Eric Schmidt, Ph.D. - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for the last question. Just a quick one for Sean on Parsabiv. Is it reasonable to expect U.S. approval this year? Thanks. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: We're very engaged right now in working toward approval. It's difficult for me to anticipate it. It's obviously the FDA's decision when they're going to grant an approval. So I don't want to set an expectation that that would be this year versus early next year. But I'm hoping that it's going to happen in the reasonably near future. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: As you know, Eric, obviously we're thrilled with the progress we're making with that in Europe as well. Okay, sorry. Arvind, why don't you go ahead and wrap up? Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks, everybody. Thanks for your participation in our call. If you have any other follow-on questions, comments, topics you would like to discuss, myself and my team will be standing by for several hours so feel free to reach out to us. Thanks again. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Amgen's Third Quarter and Financial Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : My name is Frederick, and I'll be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Fourth Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Thank you, Frederick. Good afternoon everybody. I would like to welcome you to our conference call to review our operating performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. So before we start, I would like to welcome back Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Evercore, who has returned from his leave. I would also like to acknowledge those who are relatively new in their coverage of Amgen, including Salim Syed of Mizuho Securities and Leah Cann of Oppenheimer. Welcome. Each of us look forward to working with you. So let's go ahead and get started as we have a lot of ground to cover today. I'm sure you have seen our press release by now and we are particularly pleased to report that our Repatha four-year outcome study has met its primary composite endpoint and the key secondary composite endpoint with no new safety findings. In order to ensure presentation of this important data at the American College of Cardiology meeting in March, unfortunately we will not be able to provide additional details at this time above and beyond what's in the press release. We will host an investor event on March 17 and look forward to seeing you in Washington, DC. So leading the call today will be our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, who will provide a strategic report on our performance in 2016 and outlook for 2017. Following Bob, our CFO, David Meline, will review our Q4 and full year results and provide details on assumptions imbedded in our guidance for 2017. Our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will then discuss our product performance during the quarter, followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. As in the past, we will use slides for our presentation today, which have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful to understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release, our Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website. So just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements and our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for joining our call. I want to start with the exciting news that we have positive results from our Repatha cardiovascular outcomes trial. In terms of efficacy, the trial met its primary composite and secondary composite endpoints, and importantly in terms of safety, there are were no new findings in the trial. This is obviously an important result for us and for the field as it clearly validates the outcomes benefit of PCSK9 inhibition in cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is the most costly disease for society today, and in the absence of new therapies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events for the millions of patients at high risk in the US and around the world, the burden of this disease is set to rapidly rise. This is why we've been so determined to advance Repatha as an innovative treatment option for those people whose LDL levels and cardiovascular risks aren't well managed by other available therapies. Today's announcement is the culmination of many years of hard work and investment by Amgen, our scientists and collaborators around the world, and I'd like to thank all of those, including the patients in the trial, for making this possible. We look forward to sharing the data from this rigorous 27,500 patient outcome study at the American College of Cardiology Meeting in mid March and to using the data from our entire comprehensive clinical development program for this molecule to prove the value of this innovative therapy to the health care system. As our investors know, investment in innovation and a strong conviction to use information available from human genetics to guide that investment are at the core of our strategy. Today's results for Repatha are encouraging on both dimensions of our strategy and also underscore our confidence in our ability to drive our long-term growth. Now let me turn to update you on the substantial progress we made in our priorities for 2016 with continued solid execution across the business. Our results for the year were strong, with earnings per share growing at twice the rate of revenues as reflected in our 12% growth of EPS on a non-GAAP basis and revenue growth of 6%. Our commitment to reshape the expense base of the business delivered results once more in 2016, with a decrease in operating expenses on a growing business and a 4% improvement in our operating margin on a non-GAAP basis to 52%. Through our transformation efforts, we've been able to reshape the business while continuing to invest for long-term growth. International expansion is an important element of our long-term growth plan. Consistent with that aspiration, we continued to roll out our launches of new medicines internationally, with some 94 new product stroke country launches in 2016. Our pipeline is core to our long-term growth aspiration as well, and here too, we made real progress in 2016 as three new late-stage products rapidly approached the market, including Parsabiv in kidney disease, which is already approved in Europe and we expect soon to be approved in the US; EVENITY, our romosozumab antibody in bone health; and Erenumab, our CGRP antibody for migraine. We believe our biosimilars portfolio will also be a long-term growth driver, and here too, we continue to invest in our portfolio of molecules and achieved an approval of AMJEVITA, a regulatory filing for our biosimilar to Avastin, and a successful pivotal study for our biosimilar to Herceptin. We've said for some time that one of the characteristics of our business is its strong cash flows. This year, we generated nearly $10 billion of free cash flow or an 8% cash flow yield. This enables us to return significant capital to our shareholders and to invest externally in innovation, which we did once again this year. Consistent with our confidence in our outlook for long-term growth, we once more raised our dividend, this time by 15%. As I mentioned before, we are focused on long-term growth. In 2014, we provided five-year financial commitments through 2018. We've just passed the three-year mark, and I'm pleased with our tangible progress against those commitments and we're on-track to meet or exceed them. We will likely face headwinds in 2017 as declines in our mature brands will begin to offset volume growth from our more recently launched products. This is reflected in our 2017 guidance, which David will discuss further. It's important to note that we began our transformation efforts here several years ago in anticipation of the competitive headwinds we expect to face. Operating leverage from the changes we've made enable us to drive earnings growth in the near term, while our longer-term investments have laid the foundation for growth beyond this period. The elements necessary to drive that long-term growth are clearly coming into focus with our recent launch of six new therapies including Repatha and KYPROLIS and the three we expect to launch in the near feature, as well as the emergence of our biosimilar portfolio. Shifting focus to Washington, I thought perhaps I should say a few words following our meeting with President Trump and his administration earlier this week. First, I would reiterate my appreciation for the president and his administration's interest in our industry. He was very clear about his desire to promote innovation on behalf of patients, economic growth and job creation. Second, the president and his team recognized the leading role the United States has played in the field of biotechnology, and we share their desire to strengthen the environment for employees and employers in this sector. Biotech jobs are highly skilled desirable jobs, and there's a global competition for them. We've long supported corporate tax reform as a way to level the playing field with our ex US competitors, and we look forward to being part of the policy discussions with the new administration around this area as well as regulatory reform, intellectual property protection and trade policy. I think this administration expects to deliver real progress in each of those areas for our industry. And now on the topic of drug pricing, the President was also clear, as he was throughout his campaign, about the need for us to find ways to bring down the cost of drugs for citizens in the US. We want and expect to work with the President and the administration to be part of the solution in that effort. In participation with the administration and Congress, we will seek to advance changes that enable more Americans to have affordable access to life saving and cost effective medicines. Now let's turn to David, who will review our financial performance. David? David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Bob. Turning to the fourth quarter financial results on page 6 of the slide deck, revenue at $6 billion grew 8% year over year. This quarter, we saw steady product sales performance driven by net selling price and unit demand growth versus last year. Other revenues at $302 million increased $95 million versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Other revenue benefited primarily from milestone payments, notably a milestone received related to the out-licensing of AMG 139, consistent with our focus on optimizing our portfolio of pipeline assets. Changes in foreign exchange had less than a 1% negative impact to total revenue and product sales in the quarter on a year over year basis. Non-GAAP operating income at $2.9 billion grew 21% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by over 6 points to 50.5% for the quarter, reflecting continued revenue performance, favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories, and the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment on October 31. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales improved by 1 point to 13.3%, driven by manufacturing efficiencies. Research and development expenses at $1.06 billion were flat year over year. SG&A expenses decreased 4% on a year over year basis, primarily due to the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 2% year over year. Other income and expenses were a net $202 million expense in Q4. This is unfavorable by $82 million on a year over year basis. This year over year unfavorability was primarily due to higher interest expense due to higher net debt levels, sorry, higher debt levels as well as losses from investment portfolio rebalancing in the fourth quarter of this year. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.7% for the quarter, a 7.1 point increase versus Q4 of 2015. This increase reflects unfavorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings this year as well as the realization of the full year benefit of the 2015 federal R&D tax credit in the fourth quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP net income increased 9%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 11% year over year for the fourth quarter. Please find a summary of our 2016 full year results on page 7 of the presentation. Our 2016 full year revenues grew 6% to $23 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew 12% to $11.65 per share. For the full year, non-GAAP operating income at $11.4 billion grew 14% from prior year based on the combination of solid revenue growth and a year over year decline in operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by over 4 points to 52.3% for the year, demonstrating our commitment to improve the profitability of the business as we continue to realize the benefits from our ongoing transformation initiatives. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales improved by 1.2 points to 13.3%, driven by manufacturing efficiencies. This decrease is a direct result of our continuing efforts to streamline our manufacturing processes, increase utilization of our factories, and maintain our position as a leader in the field of biologic drug manufacturing. Research and development decreased 4% as increased new business development activities were more than offset by lower spending required to support certain later stage clinical programs, as well as transformation and process improvement efforts. SG&A expenses were up 5%, primarily due to launch product expense increases, partially offset by the benefits of our transformation efforts as well as the expiration of the Enbrel residual royalty. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 1% year over year to $11.5 billion, reflecting continued benefits from our transformation and process improvement efforts. Through 2016, operating expenses have decreased by approximately $200 million versus the 2013 levels, while absorbing significant investments in new product launches, advancing our new biosimilar business and building out our global presence. We remain on track to our 2018 commitments. To date we have realized approximately $1.2 billion of transformation savings, well on our way to achieving our 2018 commitment of $1.5 billion. Other income and expenses were unfavorable by $139 million on a year over year basis due to lower investment gains realized in 2016, and higher interest expense due to higher debt balances, offset partially by higher interest income due to higher cash balances. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.8%, up 2 points versus 2015. The year over year increase was primarily due to unfavorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings, offset partially by the adoption of accounting standards update 2016-09 earlier this year. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 8. For the full year 2016 Amgen continued to demonstrate strong and durable cash flow generation with $9.6 billion in free cash flow versus $9.1 billion last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher profitability. Cash and investments increased to $38.1 billion. This balance included $2 billion in the US and $36.1 billion outside the US. Total debt outstanding increased to $34.6 billion, and carries a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% and an average maturity of 13 years. In 2016, we deployed $3 billion to repurchase 19.7 million shares at an average of $154 per share. At the end of 2016 we had $4.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Additionally for 2016, we increased our dividend per share by 27% to $1 per quarter with payments totaling $3 billion. Based on our confidence in the future outlook for the enterprise and our continued commitment to our capital allocation strategy, we also announced a 15% increase to the dividend to $1.15 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2017 on page 9. 2017 will be an important year for Amgen as we continue to progress towards achievement of our long-term commitments. We've reshaped the business to deliver top-tier margin performance while continuing to invest for the long-term growth of the business. As we enter 2017, there are several key assumptions embedded in our outlook that I would like to take a moment to share. First, our revenue guidance range for 2017 includes continued positive momentum from our growth brands and recent product launches. Our guidance also reflects the continued impact of competition against NEUPOGEN and EPOGEN as well as biosimilar competition against Neulasta commencing in the fourth quarter. We also expect competitive dynamics to result in limited net selling price yield through 2017, in particular for Enbrel as well as our contract extension with DaVita related to ESAs as previously disclosed. Next, we expect an unfavorable impact due to foreign exchange headwinds of approximately 1 percentage point to revenue growth and an approximate $0.20 unfavorable impact to non-GAAP EPS on a year over year basis, assuming current exchange rates prevail through 2017. With respect to other revenue, in 2016 we benefited from rising royalty income as well as several out-licensing transactions, which we do not expect will repeat in 2017. Therefore, we expect 2017 other revenue to be about $200 million less than in 2016. Finally, today's revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges are wider than we typically have provided in the past, which is primarily a reflection of the Repatha legal case potential results as well as how quickly payers provide access to appropriate patients as a result of the positive Repatha cardiovascular outcomes data. With this background, our 2017 revenue guidance is $22.3 billion to $23.1 billion and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $11.80 to $12.60 per share. In addition, our non-GAAP tax rate guidance is 18.5% to 19.5%. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million this year. As part of our commitment to capital allocation to shareholders, we plan to repurchase shares in a range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion in 2017. As a result of our strong progress through 2016 as well as our 2017 outlook, we remain confident we will meet or exceed the commitments provided for the 2014 to 2018 period, including double digit non-GAAP EPS growth, non-GAAP operating margin improvement from 38% to 52% to 54%, $1.5 billion of transformation savings and return to shareholders of at least 60% of non-GAAP net income on average during the period. Our 2017 guidance ranges are based on application of existing laws, including the Affordable Care Act and the current US tax code as well as current interpretation of the required 180-day notice period prior to commercial marketing of a biosimilar under the BPCIA. If any of these change in ways that are significant to our outlook, we'll provide an updated view on guidance at that time. In summary, we delivered another year of strong financial results in 2016. And we are increasingly confident in the outlook for Amgen's success in 2017 and beyond. This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Thank you, David. You'll find a summary of our performance for the fourth quarter on slide number 11. We had a strong finish to 2016, delivering fourth quarter sales growth of 6% year over year. Fiscal year 2016 sales grew by 5% to a total of $21.9 billion. Our team has delivered this growth whilst absorbing significant loss of EPOGEN and NEUPOGEN sales to competition. Growth in the fourth quarter was principally driven by Enbrel, Prolia, and our newer products, Repatha and KYPROLIS. Growth was also relatively balanced across geographies, with US growth of 7% and international growth of 5% year over year. International growth was 7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange and was fueled by an 11% volume growth. Our performance in 2016 was successful across several dimensions. We continue to drive strong volume growth of many of our brands, particularly Prolia, XGEVA, Nplate, Vectibix, KYPROLIS and Sensipar. Our international business delivered double digit volume growth. We laid the groundwork for future growth with numerous product launches outside the United States led by Repatha and KYPROLIS, which are off to strong starts in these markets. Our lifecycle management efforts in the US continue to be effective, evidenced by the uptick of Neulasta Onpro and Aranesp in the dialysis setting. We've also begun our launch preparations for the next wave of product launches, including Parsabiv, EVENITY, and Erenumab. Let's now turn to our product specific performance beginning with our bone health franchise. Prolia delivered 25% year over year growth for the full year and a 22% year over year growth for the fourth quarter, as we continue to increase share in our core markets. Prolia represents a unique opportunity. It has a strong clinical profile with the proven ability to reduce the risk of fractures, combined with strong long-term safety data. Prolia is the market leader and continues to grow in this significantly unserved disease. For context, it's estimated that nearly 200 million people worldwide suffer from osteoporosis. In the US, Europe and Japan, less than 50% of these people are diagnosed and only half of those are treated. In addition, between 2000 and 2011, there were 4.9 million hospitalizations from osteoporotic fractures in the US alone. We believe there's an opportunity to improve PMO diagnosis and treatment rates and are focusing efforts in this area. Overall, we expect Prolia to remain a significant growth driver for us into the foreseeable future. We're also excited about expanding our bone health franchise with EVENITY, our innovative bone building molecule, which is under review at the FDA. We look forward to commercializing EVENITY globally with our partner UCB. Turning now to ESAs. As we previously announced, we recently renegotiated our ESA supply agreement with DaVita. DaVita represents approximately one third of the US dialysis market and will continue to predominantly purchase EPOGEN. Our new contract replaces the previous one, extending our relationship to the end of 2022. In order to continue this strong partnership for a longer duration, as well as helping to increase certainty, we made some concessions to net selling price beginning in 2017. I'd point out that we don't expect a biosimilar entrant in the US until late 2017 at the earliest. As David said, this assumes that the current interpretation of the required 180-day notice period prior to commercial marketing of a biosimilar under BPCIA is upheld. Aranesp grew 5% year over year, primarily from gains in the mid-size and the independent dialysis organizations as they've transitioned from EPOGEN. As we noted in our third quarter call, we believe the majority of this transition is now complete. EPOGEN's rate of decline slowed to 8% year over year in the fourth quarter. Recall that Fresenius' transition to an alternative product began in the fourth quarter of 2015. Sensipar increased 7% year over year in the fourth quarter due to net selling price and unit growth with underlying TRx growth in the US of over 5% year over year. We recently launched Parsabiv in a few of the smaller markets in Europe with about 10 more expected by the end of 2017. We look forward to launching in the US following FDA approval. Once approved by the FDA, we'll work with CMS to secure reimbursement, which we expect will take between three to four months after approval. Moving now to Enbrel, where the market growth continued in the fourth quarter with over 20% year over year growth in value for both the rheumatology and the dermatology segments. Sequentially, market share of Enbrel in both segments remained relatively steady in the quarter. Enbrel fourth quarter sales benefited from an increase in end customer inventory levels. We expect about $150 million of this traversed in the first quarter this year. As we previously stated, we expect to realize minimal net selling price growth throughout 2017 based on contracts that went into effect on January 1. We also expect volume trends in 2017 to be similar to 2016. We continue to invest strategically in Enbrel including pursuit of new indications and novel delivery systems to enhance the value it brings to patients and providers. Given its long period of patent protection, Enbrel will continue to generate significant cash flows for many years to come. Let's now turn to our oncology brands, beginning with Neulasta. Neulasta declined 3% year over year due to lower unit volume partially offset by net selling price. Sequential unit volume in the fourth quarter was adversely impacted by heavier purchasing by some customers in the US during the third quarter. Fourth quarter sales of Neulasta also benefited from a single $38 million purchase by the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, otherwise known as BARDA. Based on the best available data, there appears to be a small decline in the use of myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens. Our Neulasta lifecycle management has helped to compensate for this reduction however. The strategy includes investing in our DDC campaign focused on raising awareness of febrile neutropenia risk as well as the benefits of Onpro delivery kit. As expected, we've seen an increase in the average number of Neulasta cycles for patients being treated with the Onpro. Onpro continues to gain traction and exited 2016 with approximately 50% share in the US for all Neulasta sales. We are focused on continued growth given the value Onpro brings to patients and providers and expect Onpro will be a key differentiator for future competition. Finally as David mentioned, we do not expect any long-acting biosimilar competition until fourth quarter 2017, assuming the current interpretation of the 180 days is upheld. NEUPOGEN exited 2016 holding over 50% of the short-acting market in the US. We expect competitive trends to continue into 2017 from existing and potentially new biosimilar competition. We also now face biosimilar competition in Canada. Overall, we expect the impact from competition in 2017 to be similar in relative magnitude as was in 2016. XGEVA grew 6% year over year as we continue to emphasize its clinical benefits. We look forward to having the positive multiple myeloma study data added to our label to provide these patients with a new treatment alternative. For Vectibix and Nplate, we see good year on year unit growth. Moving now to KYPROLIS. Multiple myeloma is a growing but competitive market, given the number of new treatment options. In the fourth quarter, KYPROLIS unit volume grew in both the US and the international markets. We are focused on growing our business in the second-line setting on the compelling ASPIRE and ENDEAVOR data. In the US, the focused messages of our recent campaigns are resonating with oncologists in this crowded and dynamic market. Outside the US, we continue to enter into new markets and secure reimbursement. KYPROLIS has strong uptake internationally in the fourth quarter, with a sequential unit growth of over 10%. In Europe, new patient share exceeded 20% in the second-line setting and exceeded 30% in the third-line setting. Turning now to our cardiovascular franchise. In two years, we have firmly established ourselves in the cardiovascular space. Our first product, Corlanor, helped us develop relationships and learn the market. Corlanor will continue to play a unique and essential role for certain patients. Nonetheless, we expect Corlanor will remain a niche product with modest sales of under $50 million in 2017 due to its limited label. Repatha, our second cardiovascular brand, represents one of our largest opportunities. I'm very pleased with the strong competitive execution by our team since launch. We continue to increase our share of new-to-brand prescriptions in the US, and in fact have captured just over 60% to date in January 2017. Our focus here remains on enabling access for appropriate patients. In Europe, we've made very good progress since approval in July 2015. We've now secured reimbursement in 14 markets, with more expected in 2017. We are the market leader in Europe with a 57% market share. In closing, I'm proud of the team's execution. We delivered results in 2016 in the face of intensifying competition. As we enter 2017, I'm confident that we will continue to increase our level of competitiveness, enabling us to exercise our strategy of delivering innovative therapies to patients suffering from grievous illnesses. Let me now pass you to Sean. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon. There's been a lot of progress in R&D since our last call and I'll begin my comments with our cardiovascular therapeutic area. Cardiologists have been looking for many years for an agent that could be used to treat patients already on statins who are nonetheless at high risk for cardiovascular events. At the American Heart Association meetings in November, the cardiology community was excited to see in our intracoronary ultrasound study, GLAGOV. Not only plaque regression when Repatha was added on top of optimized statin therapy in patients with established atherosclerotic heart disease, but also continued plaque reduction down to LDL cholesterol levels in the 20 milligram per deciliter range. Our hypothesis from inception of the Repatha program has been that one should strive maximally to inhibit PCSK9 and thereby maximally reduce LDL to the greatest benefit in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events, and that it makes no sense to treat to an arbitrary LDL goal in such patients. Now in our FOURIER outcomes trial, we have met the primary composite endpoint comprised of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina as well as the key secondary composite endpoint around which the study was statistically powered. This is the more objective MACE or major adverse cardiac event endpoints being non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke or cardiovascular death. Furthermore, we did not observe any new safety findings in this large placebo controlled study. We've also seen the results of an approximately 1,900 patient study of patients in FOURIER that evaluated changes in cognitive function over time, which met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority to placebo. From a scientific and medical standpoint, the FOURIER and GLAGOV studies provide a set of landmark results clearly validating the PCSK9 mechanism. And remember, this is in treatment context of the high hurdle of Repatha being given on top of optimized statin therapy. These are patients with no other meaningful therapeutic options for further LDL lowering. Bear in mind, the population studied in FOURIER has an approximately 50% 10-year residual risk of experiencing a CV event despite optimized statin therapy. And these patients are quite representative of the large number of patients like this out there in day-to-day medical practice. We look forward to presenting the data at the American College of Cardiology Scientific Session in in March. Since statins were introduced 30 years ago, our industry has been seeking a safe and effective agent to extend beyond the benefits of statin therapy. From the seminal initial association in academia of PCSK9 gene variance in humans to abnormal LDL levels and cardiovascular risk, to Amgen's elucidation of the complex biology involved, and our resulting intellectual property around Repatha, and through our extensive set of clinical trials culminating in GLAGOV and FOURIER, this program's been a remarkable example of the power of human validation of a drug target from the very beginning, based on human genetic insights. I'm proud of the role Amgen has played here and our efforts to drive this paradigm forward in many other programs, with our leading human genetics platform at deCODE and our broad suite of modalities to interdict such targets. I'm also pleased to report that the Omecamtiv mecarbil program in collaboration with Cytokinetics and Servier is advancing nicely and our 8,000 patient Phase III outcome study in chronic heart failure is now actively enrolling patients. We have also completed enrollment in the Phase II study of chronic heart failure patients in Japan, and expect to see the results later this year. Finally in cardiovascular, we've recently submitted an sBLA for a pediatric indication for Corlanor. In oncology, we announced a collaboration with Janssen to evaluate the combination of KYPROLIS and DARZALEX, two very powerful agents for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The first study to initiate will be a Phase III registrational study of KYPROLIS plus DARZALEX plus dexamethasone versus KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone in the relapsed setting with enrollment expected to begin in the second quarter of this year. We also remain committed to the frontline setting, and are in the design phase of the Phase III study of KYPROLIS plus Revlimid and dexamethasone or KRd versus Velcade plus RD in newly diagnosed transplant eligible patients. And we'll provide more details on this study as we finalize our plans. As is common in drug development, especially in oncology, registration requirements evolve with the science as treatment landscapes change. After initial consultation with regulators, our KYPROLIS weekly administration study, ARROW, had been designed with an overall response rate as the primary endpoint. Based on recent feedback from regulators, response rate is no longer deemed an acceptable endpoint in this clinical context. Therefore, we amended the protocol, making progression-free survival the primary endpoint. As this is an event driven endpoint, we now expect the results from the final analysis in 2019. We're committed to increasing our footprint in multiple myeloma, and we have several early stage innovative programs ongoing including an MCL-1 inhibitor in Phase I and CD38 and BCMA by specific T cell engaging programs. We also intend to make regulatory submissions this year for XGEVA for the prevention of skeletal-related events in multiple myeloma patients. This remains an important area of unmet need as many of these patients cannot effectively be treated with currently available therapies due to impaired renal function. In immuno-oncology, our bispecific programs continue to advance. We'll be working with regulators to update the BLINCYTO label with the overall survival data from our confirmatory study in Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed refractory ALL. We're also pursuing new indications for BLINCYTO including a submission this year for a small but clinically important population of Philadelphia chromosome-positive relapsed refractory ALL patients. We're also advancing BLINCYTO into late-stage clinical studies in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a much larger indication. While these initial studies will be conducted with our current BLINCYTO construct, we will also be pursuing an extended half-life version in this setting. In fact, we'll be advancing several extended half-life BiTE molecules into the clinic this year directed at various targets. We're also making good progress with AMG 330, our CD33 BiTE for acute myelogenous leukemia, which is progressing through dose escalation in Phase I. Within our growing multiple myeloma portfolio, we have several immuno-oncology programs we're excited about, including our biospecific CD38 molecule from Xencor and our BCMA BiTE, AMG 420, that's currently in Phase I. The potency of the BiTE platform also makes target selection critical, and we've developed a world-class proprietary target investigation platform. To augment this platform, earlier this month we announced a research collaboration and exclusive licensing agreement with Immatics, who has a unique target discovery capability in order for us to develop next-generation T cell engaging biospecific immunotherapies. Switching to bone health, along with our partners at UCB, we continue to make progress with romosozumab, now called EVENITY. We've been having productive interactions with FDA on our BLA filing for the treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women at increased risk of fracture. We're working toward a July 19 PDUFA date. And at this time, it does not appear that we will have an FDA advisory committee meeting for this program. We also recently submitted an application for marketing approval in Japan for the treatment of osteoporosis for men and women at high risk in fracture. We look forward to the primary analysis of the active controlled fracture study, ARCH, in the second quarter. In this randomized double-blind study, patients receive either alendronate or romosozumab in year one followed by alendronate in year two. The primary endpoints of the study that will be assessed at the primary analysis are the incidence of vertebral fracture at 24 months and the incidence of clinical fractures, which is event-driven. In addition, at the time of the primary analysis, an interim analysis of the secondary endpoint of non-vertebral fracture will be performed. In order to assure adequate powering in non-vertebral fracture, we will include an event-driven non-vertebral fracture final analysis. If we do not achieve significance at the time of the primary analysis in Q2, we expect the final analysis of non-vertebral fracture some months after the primary analysis. Turning to our neuroscience collaboration with Novartis, I'll begin with our CGRP receptor antibody for migraine prophylaxis, Erenumab. We have successfully completed our registrational studies and are preparing our global regulatory submissions, which we expect to occur in the second quarter. I'd like to commend our team on their execution of this program, in which we're clearly positioned to be first to market. And we'll be seeking registration in both episodic and chronic migraine. Migraine is a devastating condition that affects millions of patients, often in their most productive years of life. And we believe that for an otherwise active population, a monthly subcutaneous self-administered presentation with a patient-friendly auto-injector pen would be well received. In our Alzheimer's program, CNP520, a small-molecule BACE inhibitor, recently received Fast Track designation from the FDA, and patient screening is underway in the Phase III study we and Novartis are conducting in collaboration with the Banner Institute. Recall this study will enroll patients genetically predisposed to Alzheimer's disease who are cognitively normal, an approach that differs from many of the ongoing studies in symptomatic patients. Quickly on Enbrel, we received an expanded indication in the US, making Enbrel the first and only systemic therapy to treat pediatric patients ages 4 to 17 with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This is particularly noteworthy, as safety is always a particular concern when it comes to treating children. In nephrology we are working toward a February 9 PDUFA action date for Parsabiv for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adult patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. Parsabiv would be the only calcimimetic agent that can be administered intravenously by a healthcare provider three times a week, coincidence with hemodialysis sessions. And we believe this would allow physicians to have confidence that their patients are receiving the full benefit of the therapy. We also recently submitted an application to FDA for pediatric indication for our oral calcimimetic, Sensipar. Finally, our biosimilar programs continue to advance. In Europe we recently received a CHMP positive opinion for ABP 501 our biosimilar Humira. FDA has also accepted our BLA submission for ABP 215, our biosimilar Avastin, with an action date of September of this year. 2016 was a very positive and rewarding year with many significant accomplishments. And I'd like to thank all of our staff for their hard work and commitment to deliver important advances in medicine for the many patients still in need. 2017 is going be another exciting year. And I look forward to seeing many of you at ACC. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Sean. Let me just quickly wrap up on the year, and then we'll open up for questions. As I hope you can tell from our remarks, we have a clear strategy for long-term growth and we're executing it effectively. That's reflected in our financials with 6% revenue growth, 12% EPS and 4 percentage points of margin improvement. The Repatha outcome study we believe will enable us to show once more how innovation benefits patients and society. Now the court's recent ruling in our patent litigation is a win for the patent system and patients as it reinforces incentives for the large and risky investments we have to make in innovation to bring forward new medicines to treat serious diseases. With respect to innovation, we advanced our next set of late-stage innovative pipeline opportunities and our biosimilars program as well. We generated $10 billion of free cash flow as reflected in our free cash flow yield of 8%. We look forward to working with the administration to advance market-based reforms and solutions that further promote innovation. And as we work to address the headwinds that we've identified for 2017, I'd remind you we've made excellent progress on our long-term commitments for 2018, and we're on track to meet or exceed them. So with that, Frederick, why don't we open the line for questions, and if you wouldn't mind, let's remind our callers once more what the process is for asking questions of us. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Geez, Arvind, I need to disappear for three months to get the first question. Thank you so much for your kind words and thanks to your whole team for all the help while I was out. And thanks, Bob, for the nice note while I was gone. And congratulations to Sean on Repatha. I just had, if I may, I don't know if I'm going get an answer to this, but I thought I might try. Sean, can you give us any information at all around what the predefined non-inferiority margin might have been on the primary endpoint in the neuro cognitive trial? And if you're unwilling to answer that, maybe you can just give me your updated thoughts on the A beta hypothesis in light of the solanezumab failures? Thanks again to everybody. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Hey first, Mark, on behalf of the team, great to hear your voice. Welcome back. Sean, go ahead. There's two questions there, why don't you... Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : You only have to answer one. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah. The first one I can't answer. The second one I would say that we really don't see any read through on the decision Lilly has made with their antibody to the approach of small molecule BACE inhibition. And I think that I still am a very strong believer in BACE as a drug target and don't believe that really any of the data that's emerging with these antibodies changes the point of view we have on the amyloid hypothesis. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Sean, you might also just remind Mark and other listeners that we could also see some setbacks for other small molecule programs directed against BACE before we know that there's only CNP520.. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Right. Right. We do have the point of view and it's one that exists in the field as a whole, that it may be too late to intervene in patients who have frank Alzheimer's disease already at the time that we begin to administer these products in relatively short-term clinical trials. And this is why we and a few others are focusing on patients who are predisposed to developing cognitive impairment but are cognitively normal when they enter the treatment phase of the trials. And that's the approach we're taking. So I think we could actually see even some failures of BACE inhibitors before we see success of BACE inhibitors and certainly the antibodies are a much tougher proposition in my mind. Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI : Thanks, Sean. Congratulations to you on your trial execution. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks and my congrats also on the FOURIER data. Sean, I know the press release is silent on the other two secondary endpoints, CV mortality and all cause mortality. Should we take that silence to mean that they were missed or just that there's no ability to give us information on that right now? And when do you think you'll be able to submit the data in sPBA form to an FDA label? Thanks. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, so it's the latter. You should probably not make conclusions (49:53) about the data based on absence of statements in the press release. And we are working. As you might imagine, this is a reasonably high priority for us at the company at the moment, so we have people working right now really hard on putting together a filing. So we'll be doing that as fast as we possibly can. Operator : Our next question. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, go on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : On the Repatha trial, quick one for Sean. You put on your press release that there's a unequivocally connection between LDL lowering and CV risk reduction. Should we infer that again the data kind of like fits where we saw from the meta-analysis before? And secondly, quick question for Bob. When you met with the President earlier this week, you committed to hiring another 1,500 workers in the States. Can we get some color on that? Is that going be from manufacturing operations or is that going be for promotion of Repatha based on this data? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. So what I would say about my comment in the press release about the inequivocal is that just if you think about it, we've done this very large trial which is testing the question of whether Repatha versus placebo has an impact on cardiovascular disease and the trial is statistically significant at these key primary and secondary endpoints. So I think just by definition, that is a validation of the connection between the LDL lowering and the cardiovascular and that's all it's meant to provide, not any magnitude of effect kind of a statement. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: So, Ying, thanks for your question about the job creation. Couple things, first, these were jobs that were expected, contemplated in our plans for 2017. So this is a reflection both of our ongoing confidence and the attractiveness of the environment here in the US, and of the outlook we have for long-term growth. And we were happy to be able to share that publicly because as I said, that reflects what's our current planning assumptions. So in terms of where the jobs are, really across the business. If you want to look at some specific new areas for us, obviously we look forward to standing up a neurology franchise with our partners at Novartis and we have exciting incremental opportunity coming in bone health that we expect to be investing in. And we have some staff that we'll be hiring here to support our ongoing international expansion as well. So as you know, we launched 94 product/country opportunities last year. And so we're continuing to support those with incremental hiring. But generally, in our transformation efforts of the last few years we've been reallocating resources to where we see the most attractive growth opportunities and we'll continue to do that in 2017. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. I'm going to try a Repatha question as well, and if you don't answer that, I have a second one. But you've obviously had a bunch of conversations with payers over the last year and so I know you can't talk about the hazard ratio. But maybe you could just comment if the hazard ratio and the data as a whole gives you a high degree of confidence that you've met the demands of payers with this data set to get broader access. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: You want to offer your second question now, Matthew, so we have them both? Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, sure. Bob, I just wanted to ask you. I mean, you talked about meeting with the President, some of the goals there. I mean, do you have a view on timelines for when we might see some movement around tax reform or some of these other issues? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: I think the tax reform guidance that's out now in public is probably appropriate. So I don't think tax reform is going to be in the first wave of things to see coming out of the new administration and out of Congress, but I think we will see it this year. And we talked at some length about this, including comprehensive tax reform and repatriation and whether they'll be linked or separate. So we appreciated the administration and the President's updated guidance on that. But what I'd say, Matthew, is we expect that we'll see it. And generally, I think we're going to find that this is an administration with an action bias and I think they're going to expect to see ideas from us and others in pretty short order here to start addressing some of the concerns that they want to address for the American people. So the good news is we as a company and we as an industry have some ideas and we look forward to being able to sit down with the administration and Congress and talk about them and see what we can do to work together and make some progress. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one on your 2017 guidance. David, I think you mentioned that there was some wider range than is typical and that really reflects two things with respect to Repatha, one is the legal case and then number two is how quickly payers provide access given the data you saw. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more context for both of those? Is the commentary around the quickness of access driven by the data itself or is it driven by having these additional discussions? What's driving that? And maybe just any more detail you could share on both of those. Thank you. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, so what I would say is as it regards to the litigation, obviously there's a range of possible outcomes and positions that we have in the market, so we've tried to capture all of those in the wider range. And in terms of the uptake, what I would say is maybe Tony would like to comment, but we think again there's a range of outcomes that you would see with the uptake in the increased access. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Sure. So I mean, our focus remains on helping all payers improve access to Repatha. The utilization management criteria that they have at the moment is beyond the label and we work every day to improve upon that. We look forward to seeing the payer response now that we have the outcomes data. But of course, we won't be able to promote that until it's in the label. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Okay, Frederick, let's take the next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies. Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. So the product that you increased the prices last year, we estimate that on average, increase was about 7.45%. I mean please correct me if I'm wrong. And what was the net realized gain in the price last year? David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: So we haven't provided specific disclosure on that, although if you were to go through each of our quarterly calls, we do provide a summary of list price changes, volume and other factors, right. So I think unless you'd like to comment, Tony. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: No. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: I think you can see it's a number obviously less than 7.5%. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So, I mean we report every quarter, Eun, the makeup of product changes in terms of units, inventory and of course, at that times net selling price, which is a combination of list price changes and then contractual changes which the impact rebates over time. Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, maybe just adding to that, Eun, what I think important for us as we look into 2017, as I said in the guidance, we have a limited price uptake net in 2017, which is primarily driven by the fact that as we've said previously, we expect very limited net price on Enbrel, and as Tony mentioned again today, we've given some additional discounts as it relates to EPOGEN with DaVita. So what you can expect is that for Amgen in 2017, you'll see a reduced net price including the US pricing, which will be around inflation specs (58:41). Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Let's go to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citigroup. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thank you. So Bob, one last question around the Trump meeting. What can you say that might make us more comfortable that we won't see, because you said he's action-based, or it's an action-based administration, drug pricing pressure ahead of some reform, like more aggressive either tweeting or shaving or something that might be implemented ahead of some sort of reform? Anything that came out of that. And then on the volumes, maybe you could comment a little bit about, is there something nuanced in fourth quarter that makes you feel comfortable that the volumes will not continue to decline, they'll be less use of these types of drugs over time. What gives you that comfort that you can stabilize that? Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Sorry, Robyn. Just to be clear on the second part, are you talk about a particular product or in general? Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Sorry, I just talking about the Neulasta. You commented that there's less per cycle chemo use of these agents. I was just wondering if you could comment on that. Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, I mean I appreciate that there's a lot of interest in the discussions we had in Washington, and that's why I wanted to try to address it proactively. Again, genuinely I think that those of us that were there were encouraged by the level of interest that the President has in our businesses and in our industry, I think encouraged by the respect he has for the importance of innovation. He spoke about the need to eradicate disease in his inaugural address, and I think recognizes the power of innovation to do that. So all that, Robyn, gives us great encouragement. He talked, I think, publicly when we were with him about the need to look at areas of reform, tax reform, regulatory reform, intellectual property protection, trade policy. So all of those, I think, are encouraging for us. He's also been very clear that drug pricing is something that's important to him, and that I'm sure he's going to want to be able to deliver real benefits to the American public on that score. So obviously, I'm not in a position to comment on what he's going say, when. But I was trying to convey that genuinely we came away pleased that the administration led by the President was interested in engaging with us on the business, and we look forward to working with them and Congress to try to identify things that we all can do differently to help provide access to medicines for the people who need them. So again, I know that there's an interest on the call and by investors to better understand this, but I don't think I could add any other perspective beyond what I've already said Robyn. And with respect to Neulasta, Tony, maybe you can address her question. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Sure. So, Robyn, I mean we always try to be as transparent as possible around the data we see coming and give you guys some heads up as to what we're seeing. The calculation of the number of myelosuppressive regimens in the US, of course, is a complicated process to go through using a number of databases, and then from that we extract from it the number myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens and then within that, we look at what actually falls within the label of Neulasta itself. Looking back over the last five, eight years, it continues to fluctuate slightly all the time. And when I talk about a decline, I'm talking about a very low single digit number that I've seen the last quarter. And we're just watching that carefully, but it's been offset by the incremental cycles we're seeing with Onpro as we use Neulasta. As Bob has said in the past, the number of patients being admitted to hospital with febrile neutropenia continues to increase, and the number of people that die because of that is also on the increase. So the need continues to be there, and we continue to work hard to make sure that physicians and patients are aware of the availability of Neulasta. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Thank you. All right. Let's go to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Question, I had a question as it relates to expenses in operating margin. Obviously there's a big benefit windfall from the royalty you won't pay this year. So wanted to understand how much of that do you think could drop to the bottom. And just overall when you think about SG&A and R&D, can you continue to expand operating margins? Because I would think with the CVOT finishing up that there would be some benefit there. So if you look at the two of those, how much operating margin do you have and how much can you drop from the Pfizer benefit? Thank you so much. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Sure. So, I would say on the overall operating margin question and then going to the expense. So we finished last year, as we mentioned, at 52%. And what we were able to convey again today is that we expect to meet or exceed all of our commitments and that would include operating at 52% to 54%. So we continue to feel very good about our performance from a margin perspective. Secondly, if you look at the components of cost, and I think about it in 2017, correct. We have quite a significant improvement in our cost base due to the reduction in the royalty that's effective in 2017 as well as the fact that we'll continue to see additional benefits from transformation initiatives incrementally in 2017 as we continue to march towards the $1.5 billion goal. And partially offsetting that, and Bob touched on it earlier, we do have new expenses that we're building in the business, in particular as we launch more products internationally, that adds cost to the base as well as standing up a new neuro franchise for the company and expanding on bone, will add some cost. So I think net-net when you net those out, we'll see most of that reduction of the royalty go to the bottom line but not all this year. But again, we feel very good about the performance of the company in that we're now operating amongst the top tier in terms of not only efficiency and margin, but we're continuing to invest, I think, very appropriately in the long-term future of the business. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and again, offer my congrats on the outcomes data. So, Tony, trying to determine the commercial path for Repatha with the new data. Are there opportunities to have formulary discussions post ACC or do you think you'll have to wait for the formal PBM negotiation season this fall after legal chips in. (65:25) Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Geoff, from the revised guidance on section 114 here, we can clearly go out and talk about the top line data and talk conceptually with payers about the value this data brings to them. We can't however, at this particular stage, promote it from a sales perspective because it's not into the label yet, but we can talk to payers, yes. Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you. Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Aaron Gal, Ph.D. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you for taking my questions. I'll touch on biosimilars here, a couple of them. With interchangeability guidance, are you guys considering starting any interchangeability trials for your mAb programs? And does that differ between the anti-TNFs and the oncology program? And then regarding Neulasta, you kind of mentioned the SCOTUS risk for canceling the six months warning. But there's also a chance that they'll reintroduce the patent then. And if they do, does that essentially mean the Neulasta biosimilar will be delayed deep into 2018? Or is that still outstanding? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, I think, Ronny, I'm not sure we want to comment about matters that relate to the ongoing litigation. And with respect to interchangeability, what I would say generally, is that we think that the pathway that looks like going be pursued here in US for interchangeability is consistent with what we've been advocating for and doesn't represent a change from what we've expected. So I think that's probably, from a competitive standpoint, all I want to say at this point. Again, consistent with what our expectations have been and consistent with what we've been advocating for. Aaron Gal, Ph.D. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. So I'm wondering, on the capital allocation front, given that you now have a cash balance of nearly $40 billion to go along with significant ongoing free cash flow generation and potential favorable tax policy from the new administration, does this change the types or the size of organizations that you would potentially being be willing to look at relative to the historic strategy you guys have communicated? Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Maybe David and I can double team this, Cory. Again, we have felt for some time that we have a lot flexibility in our balance sheet to do acquisitions. And I think anything that provides clarity on the tax rate and clarity on the global tax structure would be helpful. It would probably increase our flexibility, but again, I think we have felt for some time that we have considerable flexibility to do transactions. And when we've talked in the past about the kinds of things we're looking at, we've often talked about it in the context of the big plate of things that we have internally that we're working through. But we feel like we're in a place now where we can look externally for large and small opportunities to help grow the business. So I think the message is, we're confident in the outlook for our company. We're confident in the importance of innovation. And we've got a balance sheet that supports our ability to look at transactions large and small. David, do you want to add anything to that? David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: No, that's right. I mean I would say flexibility. We remain disciplined always in making sure what we're looking at can generate a return for our shareholders, not just the sellers. And I guess from my perspective, I don't really view us even today pre-tax reform as having some arbitrary cap in terms of what we can look at. We think we need to look at all opportunities of all sizes. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks. Congratulations. That's a real milestone. Unfortunately, just a patent-related question. Could you give us a sense of the timing for your expectations for resolution of the PCSK9 litigation? And then related to that, is there any chance of an equivalent patent to the '165 patent in Europe? Do you believe that that might be infringed? And then lastly, there's some suggestions on Erenumab that some of your competitors have broad IP around the CGRP pathway. Are you confident that you'll be able to launch that product unencumbered and not at risk? Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay, Geoff, I think there were three questions there. But with respect to your first question. I think that we expect that the court will rule on the request for a stay of the injunction on or before February 21. With respect to the overall resolution of the case after that, I think it'll probably be something in the four to 10 month timeframe but we'll know more when we've heard from the courts and that will, of course, be public. And then with respect to your question about the patent outlook in Europe, obviously we don't like to comment about ongoing litigation. So I think I'll hold off on saying anything more than that. And again with respect to Erenumab, we feel confident in both the clinical profile that's emerged for that molecule, as well as our intellectual property portfolio around it. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho Securities. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great. First of all, thanks, Arvind, for the kind comments and congrats to everybody on the FOURIER data. Just two questions. One's a backup because the first one's on Repatha. So, Sean, this is not about the results that you guys now have, but this is more about the design. Can you just remind us what you were assuming in terms of bare minimum benefit in order to hit stats, say, based on how you designed the trial? And if you can't answer that, my question's around Enbrel 2018 pricing, for Tony. Is the 2017 net pricing, minimal net pricing benefit, is that a 2017 thing? Or should we assume that for 2018 and going forward as well? Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Salim, I think we can answer your first question because that's in public, the answer's public there. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, the design of the trial is published. And I guess what I would say is that, just always remember that the trial was actually designed around this harder MACE endpoint of the cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. And there we wanted to be able to detect with 90% power a 15% decrease in risk. So that was the design of the study perspective. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay, let's go to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.: The FOURIER results like reshaped the cholesterol management guidelines. How important do you think that is for defining the addressable market and enabling Repatha reimbursement? And then when might those guidelines be revised to reflect the results? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So maybe I can talk a bit about that. Obviously we look forward to hearing what the ACC and the AHA have to say when they see the full data. Everyone we've talked to has talked about revising the guidelines once they see the outcomes. And I can't give you guidance on the timing, but obviously if the data is robust enough, we would certainly hope that the guidelines would come forward pretty soon. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Josh. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks. Just maybe following up on the operating margin question. Tony, can you just give a sense for what the plan is for supporting the drugs that are now or will be facing biosimilar competition? And just your own biosimilar portfolio, how should we think about the impact of the launches of those on gross and operating margins? David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: The plan for supporting existing products base income. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Sorry, we were having a little trouble hearing you, Ian. But I think we got it. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So I think your question was what is our plan for supporting existing products that are facing biosimilar competition. Clearly, in places where we believe that the market is evolving to a branded-specific market, we continued to put activity behind the brands. Where they're becoming more commodity like we will reduce activities quite dramatically. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: And with respect, Tony, do you want to comment with respect to, either the gross or the operating margin context for our own biosimilar portfolio, or leave that for another day? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: I think we've always believed that our own biosimilar will be in a branded type market in therapeutic areas where we have a strength, and therefore we'll be using existing teams to bring these to the market as effectively as we can. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. I think we got a couple more questions queued up. So let's try to get to those, and then Arvind will be here and his team can take any follow-up questions that you all may have. So let's get to our last couple questions here. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks for taking my question, the congrats as well. But on Repatha, maybe you can talk about some of the trends you're seeing with doctors. And are they particularly concerned around the potential for an injunction? I'm just am wondering if you're starting to see people who are Praluent patients move to Repatha. Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Alethia, it's Tony. So let me give you a response. I mean, we don't track anything other than usage by physicians and, yeah, the FDA has approved Repatha for all patients, including those presently taking alirocumab and our expectation is all these patients would in fact become Repatha patients of the future. So we do see, as I said, month to date in January, 60% of new to brand patients are on Repatha. And I'd also add that a vast majority of the physicians that prescribe alirocumab have experience using Repatha, so they know the product and the benefits it provides to their patients Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, Frederick, as it's about 15 minutes past the hour, let's take two last questions please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney with Robert Baird. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess in your comments around the Trump administration meeting, you'd said that you're looking forward to working on market-based reform around drug pricing. I just wonder, in the discussion was the idea of allowing CMS to negotiate directly with manufacturers mentioned at all? Is that something still that might be on the table for the administration? And on the regulatory reform front, he had mentioned that he may be naming a new commissioner of FDA soon. I just wonder if you guys had any insight into how seriously he's taking his Silicon Valley advisors in terms of what seems to be a recommendation for complete reduction of regulatory oversight for new drugs? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Brian, I don't think I could comment on that specifically yet. I think you're right that we expect there will be an announcement about an FDA leader here soon. I think this President takes seriously what he's said about regulatory reform. And I suspect that will be reflected in his choice of a leader for FDA. But again, I think we'll all just have to wait and see. And we didn't talk any specifics about the role of HHS. We talked about the need for all of us to work together to address making medicines affordable and accessible to people who benefit from them, and who need them. But again, it was a constructive discussion, Brian. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Okay, Frederick, let's take one last question. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo Securities. Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in and congrats on the FOURIER data. Just wondering if there's anything to learn from the statin experience when we first saw outcomes benefits there as to whether the key is the data, the data presentation, the publication of the data, or the guideline revision in terms of what really drives the inflection of following these kind of outcomes data. Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Maybe I can respond to that because I'm probably old enough to remember, right. I mean so (78:01) happened in the mid 1990s. The market was dramatically different. It was the first time we'd ever seen real impact of lowering LDL. And clearly, there weren't as many sort of utilization management criteria as exists today. So uptake started quite fast as people saw the value. But it was a brand new concept, so it took a good 10 years to get to the peak of the market. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: All right. I think at this time, we'll wrap up. As I said earlier, Arvind and his team are around for those of you who have follow-on questions or didn't get a chance to ask your questions in the hour and a bit that we've been together. But let me just again thank you for joining the call and say we're looking forward to the year. We're excited about the outlook for long-term growth and about the progress that we're making towards our 2018 commitments. So with that, we'll look forward to seeing you all at ACC. Thank you. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Derek, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's first quarter financial results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks, Derek, and good afternoon, everybody. So first of all, thank you for taking the time to participate in our conference call today to review our operating performance for the first quarter of 2017. Before we begin, I would like to extend a warm welcome to those who are new in their coverage of Amgen, including Umer Raffat of ISI Evercore and Carter Gould of UBS. Each of us very much look forward to working with you. We made a lot of progress during the quarter both in our commercial execution as well as our R&D efforts, so I'm anxious to get started. I would urge you to listen for specific themes, including volume-driven growth and operational expense management as you hear our senior leaders describe our performance. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will lead the call today with a brief report on how we are executing against our long-term strategy for growth. Following Bob, our CFO, David Meline, will review our financial results for the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2017. Our head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will then discuss our product performance during the quarter, followed by our head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. And I'll give you a heads-up right now that we have a lot to discuss on our R&D efforts. As is customary for us, we will use slides for our presentation today, which have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful in understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results, and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release on Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website. Just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements, and our 2016 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay, thank you, Arvind, and thank you all for joining our call. It's been an active first quarter at Amgen. And before talking about our financial results, I want to put the events of the first 90 days of the year in context because I think they underscore the reasons why we're confident about achieving our long-term objectives for growth. As you know, we're focused on six therapeutic categories. And during the quarter, we achieved important milestones in each of them. Core to our strategy is a commitment to differentiated innovation. We aim for products with a big effect size in areas where the unmet need is high. That's what we feel will be required to succeed over the long term in this industry. In our cardiovascular portfolio, we strongly believe Repatha represents one such product. As all of you know, cardiovascular disease poses by far the biggest health burden on society today. And our outcomes data demonstrated unequivocally that Repatha can play an important role in reducing that burden. And the data also showed to my mind that the rate of cardiovascular events, which approached 10% per year in the optimized statin arm of the trial, is still far too high without Repatha. Against this backdrop, we expect Repatha to be an important product in the fight against cardiovascular disease and increasingly expect physicians, patients, and other stakeholders to recognize that rejecting an innovative drug for high-risk patients which demonstrated beyond 12 months a 35% reduction in the risk of heart attack, a 24% reduction in the rate of stroke, and a 28% reduction in the rate of revascularizations is simply inappropriate. The practice of medicine won't change overnight but it won't stall either, not in the face of an innovative new therapy that can prevent hundreds of thousands of otherwise needless and tragic events. In the U.S. alone, cardiovascular disease costs our society in excess of $600 billion a year. And without meaningful innovation like Repatha to change the trajectory of this disease, those costs will exceed $1.2 trillion by 2035. We believe it's right to embrace innovation not only for patients but also for society. Economic study after study has shown that society benefits financially from adopting therapies like Repatha. Nonetheless, we recognize the access challenges of the day, and that's why we have and will continue to offer innovative value-based contracts to help build a bridge between the medical need and the affordability concerns for patients and payers. In addition to novel biology, intellectual property is another source of differentiation for our innovation. We were obviously gratified this quarter by the Delaware court's support for our position on Repatha, and we now stand ready for the Appeals Court to hear the case in June. In oncology, there's no better standard for differentiated innovation than achieving an overall survival advantage for patients. In the first quarter, we achieved that with both KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO. The BLINCYTO results are encouraging for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia obviously. But more broadly, they are encouraging as validation for the whole approach of our immuno-oncology BiTE platform. Perhaps because we are the only company with an advanced BiTE platform, this area is not as well understood in the investment community as other areas of immuno-oncology, but we're excited about the potential of our BiTEs and have several programs moving swiftly in our pipeline. We look forward to sharing data as they become available from these efforts. The overall survival data for KYPROLIS achieved at an interim analysis in relapsed multiple myeloma patients are also very important and timely. Having established superiority versus Velcade, we expect these data will drive increased share for KYPROLIS, particularly in the second line, and will also be helpful for reimbursement considerations. Also in multiple myeloma this quarter, we achieved positive results for XGEVA. And subject to regulatory approvals, we look forward to being able to offer this therapy to multiple myeloma patients, many of whom are at risk of skeletal-related events such as those prevented by XGEVA. Bone health remains an area of high unmet medical need, as still millions of women at high risk for postmenopausal fractures remain untreated. Reflecting on the number of postmenopausal fractures, the World Health Organization called this a global epidemic. Prolia's ongoing significant volume-driven growth, 21% in the quarter, attests to the value of differentiated innovation in this field. Already the leader in bone health, we expect EVENITY will strengthen our hand. And while we await both further clinical data and regulatory reviews, Sean will describe the encouraging results that we received this quarter for the three-year follow-up from the FRAME study. While discussing our strategy of differentiated innovation, I also want to address our newest therapeutic area, which is of course neuroscience, where we are on the threshold of a novel first-in-class therapy for migraine sufferers. We had the opportunity to present our registration-enabling data at the American Academy of Neurology this week. And not surprisingly, experts in the field were excited about erenumab in an area where there is otherwise precious little to offer those suffering from episodic and chronic migraine. I've seen some headlines asking whether our expanded collaboration with Novartis signals a waning of our enthusiasm for this opportunity. The answer is absolutely not. We have high hopes for erenumab. And at the same time, we recognize this is a new therapeutic category for us and will likely be a competitive race. So we were very pleased that Novartis, already our collaborator in international markets, shared our enthusiasm for this first-in-class molecule in the U.S. and our determination to resource this product to win. With their decades of experience in neurology and a shared commitment to serve those suffering from migraine, we're excited about our expanded collaboration. When it comes to strategy, you've also heard us talk about life cycle management, especially for our legacy franchises. The Neulasta Onpro launch is now widely seen as one of the most effective examples of this, with market shares now in excess of 50% in the U.S. In nephrology, we announced earlier this quarter an extension of our partnership with DaVita for EPOGEN. And of course, we also gained approval for Parsabiv in the U.S. As the established leader in nephrology therapeutics, we continue to look for ways to serve patients with kidney disease and expect this to remain an important franchise for us. As you know, an element of our strategy includes developing a portfolio of biosimilars, and I'm glad that we made that commitment, as I think there will be a robust market for these products. And while our portfolio of 10 biosimilars is progressing across the board, the highlight for the quarter was in inflammation, where we received EU approval to go along with our U.S. approval of AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to Humira. The first steps in building out this business are to establish biosimilarity and gain registration, and obviously we have done that now for an important molecule in the biggest markets. The next step is to navigate the IP landscape, and the process for that is underway. Over the past couple of years, we've talked on these calls about our ongoing transformation efforts. We committed to a companywide transformation, real, meaningful change designed to make us more competitive, improve our operating margins, and ensure that we would be in a strong position to return capital to our shareholders during this period of increasing competition for our legacy franchises and while launching nine innovative products, maintaining our investment in innovation, advancing our biosimilars portfolio, and expanding our international presence from 50 to over 100 countries. We have asked a lot of our staff, and they have delivered. In our past results, you've seen our steady progress, and you see it once again this quarter, where our margins have grown and we delivered 9% earnings per share growth. Looking forward, our orientation is long-term growth with volume-driven products, and we think we can deliver that across our focused therapeutic franchises. But we're also set on managing the business tightly to deliver in the short and medium term too. You should see this in our track record, and that's what you see in this quarter as well. Our balance sheet and cash flows are strong, and we're looking for investment opportunities, albeit with a determination to add value for our shareholders, not just someone else's. Given valuations across many targets in the sector at the moment, that's challenging, but we'll remain patient and discriminating when it comes to M&A. We've long advocated the need for corporate tax reform. If innovative U.S. companies are to remain competitive, we need a level tax playing field. We don't have one now, but we're hopeful this administration will deliver that in 2017. Obviously, we think such change would improve our flexibility for capital allocation. I've taken a bit longer than usual on this call, but with all of the events of the first quarter, I wanted to make sure to reiterate that we're investing in long-term opportunities, managing the business tightly, and are poised to capitalize on investment opportunities which might arise. With that, let me once again thank our staff for their engagement with our mission, and then turn to David. Thank you. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Bob. We were pleased with our solid overall results and earnings growth again in the first quarter, as our transformation efforts enabled progress in an environment of strong competition and portfolio transition. We also were encouraged by our 7% volume growth in Europe, reflecting the value of our innovative products in a market where we have experienced similar competition and portfolio transition for a number of years. Turning to the financial results on page 6 of the slide deck, worldwide revenues at $5.5 billion in the first quarter are flat year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange and are 1% lower on a reported basis including FX. Worldwide product sales at $5.2 billion in the first quarter are flat year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange and are 1% lower on a reported basis including FX, as strong unit demand for our newer products was offset by declines in our mature brands. Other revenues at $265 million decreased $23 million versus the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP operating income at $3 billion grew 5% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by 3 points to 57.6% for the quarter, reflecting continued favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories and the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payments in Q4 of 2016. As in prior years, our operating margin is expected to be lower in the remaining quarters of the year, driven by the timing of expenses. On an overall full-year basis, we expect another year of strong operating margins, driven by tight operational expense management. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales improved by 0.4 points to 13.1%, driven by manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by product mix. Research and development expenses at $748 million were down 13% year over year, driven by a first quarter 2016 payment related to a third-party collaboration agreement, lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs, and continued benefits from our transformation initiatives. Research and development as a percent of product sales at 14.4% is lower in Q1, consistent with previous years. Going forward, research and development expense as a percent of product sales is expected to normalize around 2016 levels. SG&A expenses decreased 6% on a year-over-year basis due to the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payments, partially offset by increased investments in new product launches. In aggregate, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 7% year over year and remain on track to meet or exceed our 2018 commitment of $1.5 billion in transformation savings, while investing to build the business globally, support new product launches, and invest in the long-term pipeline for the business. Other income and expenses were a net $131 million expense in Q1. This is favorable by $13 million on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by higher cash balances. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.5% for the quarter, a 0.4-point decrease versus the first quarter of 2016. This decrease reflects favorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings, partially offset by a smaller benefit from share-based compensation tax expenses compared to the first quarter of last year. As you may recall, this benefit is a result of the adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-9, requiring these tax impacts to be recognized on the income statement versus the balance sheet. The benefit of this adoption contributed approximately $0.06 to our non-GAAP earnings per share in this quarter compared to $0.09 in the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income increased 6%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 9% year over year for the first quarter to $3.15 per share. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 7, free cash flow was $2.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of $400 million over last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher profitability as well as timing impacts of income tax payments to the IRS. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders, consistent with our commitments, as we deployed $0.6 billion to repurchase 3.4 million shares at an average of $163 per share, and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, as previously communicated. Additionally, our first quarter dividend increased to $1.15 per share, an increase of 15% over last year. Cash and investments totaled $38.4 billion, an increase of approximately $3.7 billion from the first quarter of last year. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow generation. Our debt balance stands at $34.1 billion as of March 31, carrying a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% and an average maturity of 12 years. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2017 on page 8, overall our 2017 revenue guidance remains unchanged at $22.3 billion to $23.1 billion. Our first quarter volume and price performance was in line with our plans, as we experienced a solid contribution from our newer products while managing the impact of competition against the balance of the portfolio. Revenue guidance also reflects the potential impact of the Repatha litigation and improving access for appropriate patients as a result of the positive Repatha cardiovascular outcomes data. Finally, our guidance takes into account potential biosimilar competition against Neulasta commencing as soon as the fourth quarter of this year. With regard to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we are raising the outlook to $12.00 to $12.60, reflecting our overall solid Q1 performance. In addition, our non-GAAP tax rate guidance remains unchanged at 18.5% to 19.5%, and we expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year. As previously stated, our 2017 guidance ranges are based on application of existing laws, including the Affordable Care Act and the current U.S. tax code as well as current interpretation of the required notice period prior to commercial marketing of a biosimilar under the BPCIA [Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act]. We will continue to update guidance going forward for changes in these factors and any other business updates. Finally, consistent with our 2017 outlook, we remain confident we will meet or exceed the commitments provided for the 2014 to 2018 period, including: double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth; non-GAAP operating margin improvement from 38% to 52% to 54%; $1.5 billion of transformation savings; and return to shareholders of at least 60% of non-GAAP net income on average during the period. This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. You'll find our product sales starting on slide number 10. Our business performance is shifting to a more volume-driven growth as we launch innovative products targeting the large patient populations with unmet medical needs. Whilst our focus is on innovation, we have also executed effective life cycle management strategies for some of our legacy brands which are facing potential new competition. Although U.S. revenues declined 1%, our ex-U.S. growth was 3%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, fueled by a 7% volume growth. I'll now discuss our specific product performance and will structure my comments by therapeutic area. Let me begin with our bone health franchise. Prolia is a great example of one of our innovative products that realized robust volume growth during the quarter, with most of its 21% year-over-year sales growth driven by unit volume. Prolia, with a strong value proposition, is uniquely positioned in postmenopausal osteoporosis as the leading branded product on the market. We will continue to invest in Prolia to reach a greater number of patients whilst reinforcing adherence for those already taking Prolia to ensure they continue to realize its benefits. Overall, we expect Prolia will remain a significant growth driver, as the approximately 850,000 U.S. patients on Prolia therapy only represent about 20% of patients presently being treated for postmenopausal osteoporosis. We also look forward to expanding our bone health franchise with romosozumab, our innovative bone-building molecule for which we now have a trade name, EVENITY. In conjunction with our partners at UCB, we're preparing for a U.S. launch in advance of the July 19 PDUFA date. As Bob pointed out, having the ability to co-position EVENITY and Prolia sequentially will improve our ability to better treat those large patient populations. For thousands of high-risk postmenopausal osteoporosis patients such as those who have fractured, we have a proven therapeutic strategy with EVENITY to first build strong new bone in patients with 12 months of treatment, followed by Prolia for proven continued fracture risk reduction. Oncology is another area that is benefiting from volume growth with our recently launched products. Let me start with KYPROLIS. KYPROLIS realized 23% year-on-year growth during the quarter. And most of this growth was volume-driven, including our international markets. As you know, KYPROLIS is indicated in the U.S. for second and third-line multiple myeloma. In second-line, triplet regimens are used in approximately one-third of patients. And despite new entrants, we've been able to achieve about 50% market share for new patient starts in this segment. The other two-thirds of second-line patients are treated with doublet regimens. And recent data from our ENDEAVOR study had demonstrated that KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone improved overall survival by 21% or nearly 8 months when compared to the Velcade plus dexamethasone. Improving overall survival is the gold standard measurement when treating cancer. This data clearly establishes KYPROLIS as the proteasome inhibitor of choice and will be a compelling differentiator in our strategy to displace Velcade in this setting. KYPROLIS is well accepted in large academic centers that treat high numbers of multiple myeloma patients. And we are now focusing on extending KYPROLIS's reach into the community oncology practices. Despite the introduction of new competing products in the U.S., we have also regained share in new third-line patients over the last few quarters. We expect proteasome inhibition to be foundational therapy in multiple myeloma for many years to come and are focused on growing in second and third lines of therapy with plans to expand KYPROLIS's use in newly diagnosed patients. Outside the U.S., we continue to enter into new markets and secure reimbursement with the benefit of the new KYPROLIS overall survival data. XGEVA grew 6% year over year, mostly due to volume, as we continue to emphasize its clinical benefits. We look forward to having the positive multiple myeloma study data added to our label. This will expand the patient population eligible for XGEVA treatment. Both Nplate and Vectibix saw another good quarter of volume growth of 9% and 6% respectively. Neulasta sales increased 2% year over year, as we continue to see a small decline in the use of myelosuppressive chemotherapeutic agents. The first quarter also benefited from accounting estimate changes due to lower Onpro returns, underscoring that Onpro delivery is working better than initially assumed. We continue to drive increasing adoption, and Onpro now represents over 50% share of all Neulasta purchases. This has been a great example of a very successful life cycle management strategy. And as David explained earlier, we expect minimal impact in 2017 from potential long-acting biosimilar competition. I'd also note that the first quarter historically benefits from heavier purchasing by certain end customers, and we estimate this benefit in quarter one to be about $50 million, which we expect to reverse in quarter two. For NEUPOGEN, the impact of competition was in line with prior performance. We entered the quarter retaining a 46% share of the short-acting market in the U.S. We expect these competitive dynamics to continue over the course of 2017. Moving now to Enbrel, I would start by emphasizing that we see no trend break versus 2016. And I will go through Enbrel carefully and in some detail because I don't want you to misinterpret long-term dynamics based on some quarter one peculiarities. Before getting into quarterly performance, I'd like to highlight that we utilize IMS prescription data to analyze the business. Like many of you, we noticed a slowdown in the first quarter IMS scripts. This has implications for our views on segment demand and end-user inventory levels. We've been in close contact with IMS, and they agree that the first quarter prescription data appears soft in several specialty product categories, including rheumatology and dermatology. As a matter of fact, on a year-over-year basis, unit growth in rheumatology appeared to slow from 9% in the first quarter of 2016 to 2% in this quarter, and from 25% to 9% in the dermatology segment for the same period. IMS attributes the softness to a combination of several factors, including the number of shipping days in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the first quarter of 2017, the impact of patient out-of-pocket costs including deductibles, and the Part D donut hole for the start of a new year, as well as the potential increasing use of 90-day prescriptions. This is also consistent with our view of the market. We noted our expectations that 2016 trends would continue into 2017. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, our share declined 1 percentage point to 32% in rheumatology and declined 2 percentage points in dermatology to 15%, in line with 2016 share trends. As for the end-user inventory, we previously said that we expected quarter one reductions due to the quarter four 2016 $150 million excess inventory. Based on the IMS data, we calculated an approximate $30 million reduction in inventory levels this quarter. And therefore, we expect the remainder to be used up during the course of the year. Obviously, the accuracy of the IMS data has implications for understanding of both unit demand dynamics and end-user inventory. Consistent with our previous guidance, net selling price had a minimal impact on year-over-year sales growth during quarter one. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, we are seeing increased commercial patient copay assistance impacting their selling price, which is likely a function of higher patient out-of-pocket costs. This impact typically tapers off over the remainder of the year, and our view on net selling price in 2017 is unchanged. We are optimistic about a rebound in both Enbrel and Enbrel segment growth in future quarters, as IMS prescription data from the more recent weeks shows improvement versus the beginning of the year in both rheumatology and dermatology. So in summary, the quarter one results likely reflect a temporary marketplace issue, and we believe the long-term dynamics are intact and in line with our prior expectations. There remain a substantial number of patients for which Enbrel is the best treatment option given its competitive efficacy and long-term safety profile. We will continue to invest in Enbrel to enhance its value it brings to patients and providers. Given its long-term period of patent protection, Enbrel will continue to be a significant cash flow generator for Amgen for many years to come. Turning now to our nephrology products, beginning with Aranesp, on a worldwide basis, Aranesp declined 4% year over year. In the U.S., it increased by 7%, including the conversion from EPOGEN at numerous independent and midsize dialysis centers. This conversion was substantially completed by quarter three of 2016, with Aranesp now representing over 85% of the ESA usage. Performance outside the U.S. was negatively impacted by foreign exchange as well as the timing of tenders in certain markets. Now to EPOGEN, as previously disclosed, we recently renegotiated our supply agreement with DaVita. DaVita represents about one-third of the U.S. dialysis market, and they will continue to predominantly purchase EPOGEN through 2022. In exchange for longer supply certainty, we made concessions on net selling prices, which impacted the quarter-on-quarter results. Also, as David mentioned, we do not expect a material impact to our ESA business in 2017 from a short-acting biosimilar competitor. Sensipar increased 15% year over year, driven by a combination of net selling price and volume growth. Parsabiv, our innovative new cosmetic, delivered intravenously, is now approved in both the U.S. and Europe. And we are working with CMS to secure a reimbursement mechanism in the U.S. Let me now turn to our cardiovascular franchise and Repatha. Let me first address the quarter-on-quarter growth, which might look a little strange. Quarter four 2016 was slightly inflated due to the booking of a Middle East tender, which was not repeated in quarter one this year. With closer examination of the data, you will see that we recorded positive volume growth in the U.S. of 14% and 28% in Europe. In the U.S., we achieved segment share of 64% in quarter one for new-to-brand patients and briefly touched on 70% as we exited the quarter. In Europe, we exited 2016 with 56% segment share. Our U.S. formulary coverage has greatly improved over last year, especially in Medicare Part D, where we have almost tripled the number of lives covered. Results of the Repatha cardiovascular outcomes study that were presented at the American College of Cardiology last month are clearly a game-changer for cardiovascular patients, showing significant reductions in MIs and strokes. We also shared our analysis on the economic value of Repatha at the ACC. This calculation used standard peer-reviewed methodology, using real-world event rates and imputed mortality benefit from the meta-analysis of previous studies, the CTTC relationship, and concluded that prices in the market today are well within the value-based price range. Naturally, this calculation is based on average net selling price and not the list price. Since the ACC, we've been engaging with payers in the U.S. and across the world on Repatha's clinical data and economic value. We are in active discussions with all of the large U.S. PBMs and payers, and they recognize the importance of Repatha's outcome data to patients. We are focused on reducing barriers and improving processes to make it easier for a physician to prescribe Repatha and for patients to get access to this important therapy. We expect payers will start changing utilization management criteria and processes over the coming months. Several independent groups have studied the access situation and have concluded that current access barriers are inappropriate and potentially harmful to patients. As pointed out in the recent publication by the Partnership for Health Analytic Research, or PHAR, it started with the irresponsible prediction of healthcare costs prior to FDA approval of the PCSK9 inhibitor class. These overestimates resulted in onerous restrictions and lack of patient access from the beginning. At the ACC last month, two research teams, including one from Duke, presented data showing that patients' clinical characteristics were no different between those denied reimbursement for PCSK9 versus those approved, showing that payer utilization management processes were nothing but an arbitrary barrier to access. And just today, the FH Foundation published a peer-reviewed paper in the journal Circulation showing that 63% of FH patients and 58% of established ASCVD patients had their PCSK9 inhibitor claims rejected despite having suboptimal LDL-C levels and being on moderate or high-intensity statins. Cardiovascular disease continues to be the number-one cause of death and disability in the world. And in a moment, Sean will remind us of the incredible outcome value that Repatha has demonstrated by its ability to reduce both MI and stroke. This data together with the groundswell of cardiology and patient pressure will result in increasing levels of patient access. Repatha will continue to grow for many years to come, making it one of the largest innovative assets Amgen has brought to market. Let me conclude by saying a few words about erenumab and our recently announced expanded collaboration with Novartis. We believe that partnering with Novartis, a company that is well-positioned in the neuroscience space, will enable us to maximize the launch of this first-in-class product. We believe that erenumab will offer a strong value proposition to millions of patients suffering from chronic or episodic migraines. Let me close by thanking all the Amgen staff that worked so hard and tirelessly to get our important products to patients around the world. Sean? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. I'll begin my comments today with Repatha. As you know, we presented the results of our Repatha cardiovascular outcomes study at the American College of Cardiology meetings in March with simultaneous publication in The New England Journal of Medicine. This represented a major step on the path of getting this therapy to the patients who so desperately need it. The study had several objectives : first, to validate the PCSK9 mechanism with respect to cardiovascular outcomes; second, to establish the safety of reaching unprecedented low LDL levels, recall that 25% of patients in the Repatha arm had on-treatment LDLs below 19; and third, to understand whether the linear relationship established by statins and ezetimibe between LDL and cardiovascular risk continues down to very low LDL levels, as the human genetics had suggested. This study gave clear positive results on all of these objectives. The results also validated our dosing approach of maximally inhibiting PCSK9 with Repatha, and that when it comes to LDL, as we began to hear cardiologists coin at the ACC, lowest is best. Importantly, outcomes data from Pfizer's discontinued PCSK9 program were presented and also published in The New England Journal of Medicine, confirming the efficacy seen in our study and demonstrating that not all PCSK9 antibody therapies are the same with respect to off-target liabilities. Now there's been a fair amount of speculation in the press and elsewhere about the magnitude of the risk reduction observed in our study, so I'm going to spend a bit of time on the results. We have found that the vast preponderance of experts in this field view this study as highly successful in terms of the observed effect size. Essentially, the results are exactly as what would have been achieved had one been able to reduce LDL to the same degree with additional statin therapy were it possible to do so without unacceptable toxicity. Specifically, experts understand that the treatment lag that occurs in the first year of therapy, a phenomenon seen in all lipid-lowering trials in this type of population, represented a much larger proportion of the median time on therapy in our study, which was just over two years, versus the average 5.5-year-long statin study. They also understand that adjusting appropriately for duration of therapy, the results line up extremely well with the cholesterol treatment trial as a collaboration or CTTC meta analyses. When one looks at the pre-specified landmark analyses for this chronic therapy, after the first year when the treatment lag is over and the true chronic value of the therapy can be assessed accurately, the risk reductions in myocardial infarction 35%, stroke 24%, and revascularization 28% are quite impressive, particularly in the setting of such a remarkably clean safety profile. Experts also understand why one should not have anticipated an impact on CV mortality in such a study, and I would refer those who are interested to an excellent editorial on this subject published recently in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology. And to just remind us of the clinical reality here, many millions of patients like those in our outcome studies have a high annual risk of CV events, despite maximally tolerated statins, and have no other therapeutic alternative to take their LDLs down to levels that significantly protect them from such events. In fact, we were all surprised by the fact that despite optimized therapy with best standard of care, including high-intensity statins, patients in the placebo arm of our CV outcome study had an annual event rate of almost 10%, which clearly demonstrates the unmet need here, as event rates in the real world are significantly higher than those seen in clinical trial settings. Now one of our highest priorities is to ensure these results are reflected in the Repatha label as soon as possible, and we're targeting regulatory submissions by midyear. I'd also note that the Repatha 420-milligram single-dose delivery option was recently approved in Europe. Turning to oncology, we completed XGEVA regulatory submissions in the U.S. and Europe for the prevention of skeletal-related events in multiple myeloma patients, providing a potential new treatment option for patients, many of whom are not able to avail themselves of alternative therapies due to renal insufficiency. In multiple myeloma, we received the overall survival data from the ENDEAVOR study in relapsed or refractory patients, which confirm the superiority of KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone over Velcade plus dexamethasone. In fact, ENDEAVOR was the first head-to-head study to demonstrate a survival benefit versus a current standard-of-care regimen in this setting, and we're preparing to submit these results to regulators as well. We also remain on track to begin enrollment this quarter in our Phase 3 study of KYPROLIS in combination with DARZALEX in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and also recently began enrolling a Phase 1b study of new formulations of oprozomib. Turning to our immuno-oncology programs, I'll begin with our BiTE platform. We were very pleased that FDA granted BLINCYTO Priority Review for our recent sBLA that includes overall survival data from our Phase 3 study to support conversion from accelerated to full approval. The application also includes new data in Philadelphia chromosome-positive relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a small population but an area of significant unmet need. We also continued to roll out our Phase 2/3 BLINCYTO program in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the most common form of high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We also had the opportunity in the recent American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting to present preclinical data from some of our new BiTE programs, including half-life extended constructs. We continue to make good progress with the investigation of Enlogic in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, and we'll be presenting the results of our Phase 2 study in combination with Yervoy at ASCO as well as some very interesting human biomarker data at the Congress of the European Association of Dermato Oncology. Finally, in the early-stage immuno-oncology pipeline, we're making progress on our Advaxis collaboration and have an investigational new drug application in place for a personalized neo-antigen-targeted approach to cancer immunotherapy. In our bone therapeutic area, our collaboration with UCB on EVENITY continues to advance, and we look forward to our July U.S. PDUFA date for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture. Ahead of this, we expect the primary analysis of our active controlled fracture study, ARCH, in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in the near future. I will remind you that the upcoming primary analysis will include the clinical fracture and vertebral fracture primary co-endpoints as well as an interim analysis of the event-driven non-vertebral fracture study secondary endpoint. If statistical significance is not achieved at this interim analysis, the study will continue until the final analysis some months later. We designed ARCH in this manner to ensure adequate powering at the non-vertebral fracture endpoint. I would also point out that compared to the placebo-controlled FRAME study, the ARCH study compares EVENITY followed by alendronate to antiresorptive therapy with alendronate throughout the study period. These sequences are being assessed in a higher-risk population than our FRAME study, with all subjects in ARCH required to have prevalent fracture. This was possible given the active comparator design, and we were not exposing these higher-risk patients to placebo. If you recall in the FRAME study, the event rate for non-vertebral fractures was much lower than expected. And at 12 months, the non-vertebral relative risk reduction was 25% in the EVENITY-treated patients but was not significantly significant. In an exploratory analysis reported at ASBMR [American Society for Bone and Mineral Research], the relative risk reduction at two years in FRAME was 25% with a nominal T-value that was less than 0.05. We recently conducted the three-year analysis of this study, which again demonstrated nominal significance for non-vertebral fracture, demonstrating that a year of EVENITY therapy still had high treatment impact through year three, despite the fact that the control group received a very potent antiresorptive agent, Prolia, in years two and three. Within our neuroscience collaboration with Novartis, we had the opportunity to present the results from our two Phase 3 erenumab studies in episodic migraine at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting yesterday. The data demonstrated the robust and consistent effect of inhibiting the CGRP receptor with erenumab. And feedback from experts at the meeting have been very positive, with many viewing this as a potentially game-changing therapy for a debilitating, highly symptomatic disease. We look forward to making first-in-class regulatory submissions for erenumab that incorporate our episodic and chronic data later this quarter. AMG 301, our PAC-1 antibody for migraine, also continues to progress. We've seen encouraging pharmacodynamic activity in our Phase 1 study in normal subjects and are currently designing a Phase 2 program in migraineurs, which we expect to begin later this year. Also in the quarter, Phase 3 enrollment in Alzheimer's disease began for the small molecule BACE inhibitor, AMG 520, we are developing with Novartis. In our inflammation collaboration with AstraZeneca-MedImmune, I am pleased to provide a program update for AMG 157 or tezepelumab, our monoclonal antibody that inhibits thymic stromal lymphopoietin or TSLP. TSLP is an epithelial-derived cytokine produced in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli that drives inflammatory responses. TSLP expression is increased in the airways of patients with asthma, the magnitude correlating with the severity of disease. Some of you may recall that our Phase 1b data were quite compelling and were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2014. Together with AZ-MedImmune, we've now received the results from a large double-blind Phase 2b study in patients with inadequately controlled severe asthma in which AMG 157 demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations compared to placebo at 52 weeks, successfully meeting the primary endpoint. This is a very encouraging result. And together with AZ-MedImmune, we are currently evaluating the potential for this agent to address a broad population of patients with severe asthma. Briefly in nephrology, in the first quarter we also received approval for Parsabiv, our innovative IV calcimimetic that is administered thrice weekly at the end of dialysis for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease. And lastly in biosimilar news from Europe, we received approval for AMGEVITA, our biosimilar Humira, for all available indications and submitted ABP 980, our biosimilar Herceptin, for approval. In closing, I'd like to acknowledge our staff for advancing these important programs on behalf of patients. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay, thank you, Sean. I know we've taken more time than usual on our introductory remarks, so let's go straight to questions, Derek, and just please remind our callers of the process for the next step. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence, begin your question. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thanks for taking the question, maybe just a two-part on Repatha. First, Tony, can you comment if the payers appreciate the details of the four-year data that Sean walked through? And then it looks like net price might have taken a step down in the U.S. in the first quarter. I'm just wondering if you can confirm that and any additional commentary that you can provide. Thank you. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Terence, sure. All our discussions with the payers have been really starting with the discussion on the Repatha outcomes data, and I don't think we've had any pushback at all in terms of people really understanding the robust value. We will continue to work with them. Obviously, each one of them has agreed to go back and relook at the utilization management criteria as we speak. There does appear to be a slight adjustment in the net price. One was due to a small accounting adjustment. And two, of course, we book our patient copay program to the net price, and the first quarter is normally a lot higher than second, third, or fourth. So we see that normalizing as we go forward. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Can we go to the next question? Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew, you may begin your question. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks for taking the question. Tony, thanks for the detail on Enbrel. I'm sure, as you appreciate, there's a lot of questions that people have on that. If I can just ask two points there, you cited a market slowdown which you think will improve throughout the rest of the year. Could you just talk about your confidence around that? And beyond some of the weekly data points, are there other reasons to believe that broadly the market is not slowing? And then second, it seems to me that the impact on price in the first quarter is higher than you've seen in quarters past, even when thinking about copay assistance and some of the other factors. Is there anything else going on there, and what's your confidence about price leveling out for the year? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks, Matt. So as you know, with Enbrel as a retail product, about 97% of the volume is reported on a script basis, so we can track it quite tightly. For the quarter, it was definitely down, both rheumatology and dermatology. When I look at it sequentially, January, February, March, and then as I see it going into April, each one of those months has shown an incremental growth both in terms of DOT as well as prescriptions and in terms of growth. So January was down a lot. February was better than January. March was better than February, and April is starting to look much better than March as well. From a net price, we don't see a dramatic change in the net price. Some the new contracts are coming into place, but our outlook on net price for 2017 hasn't changed at all. And when I look at abandonment rates, abandonment rates in the first quarter are pretty similar for Enbrel to what they were in the fourth quarter or the third quarter last year. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: And, Matthew, maybe just big picture here, when we look at the flow of patients into the information space, particularly rheumatology and dermatology, we see no reason in the marketplace that the trend of an increasing number of patients into this therapy would have abruptly changed between the fourth and the first quarter. So we think that we'll continue to see growth in the underlying demand for these kind of products. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ying, you may begin your question. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on Repatha. How much have you heard from the physicians in terms of feedback that they have to wait for a treatment guideline change by, let's say, ACC or AHA before they start prescribing more Repatha? And if that's the case, when do you think those professional organizations will change the guideline? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: I think it's probably a subtle question that you're asking there, Ying, so why don't we just take a moment and really step through it. Tony, why don't you go ahead and take the first go. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So all our discussions with cardiologists have been around their frustration of the administrative burden that has been placed upon them to get a prescription for appropriate patients. A lot of them are having to hire full-time nurses to spend the entire day chasing down required patient data, to chase down interactions between the patient or between the physician and the respective payer or the PBM. The guidelines themselves clearly in everyone's mind would help move the decision-making and the utilization criteria a bit quicker. But our major conversation with physicians is not really around the guidelines; it's more around the inconvenience. From a guideline perspective, clearly both the AHA and the ACC are busy looking at the outcomes data. They've told us they're busy identifying position papers they wish to put forward. The NLA, the National Lipid Association, was there. The Association of Preventive Cardiology (sic) [American Society of Preventive Cardiology] (54:25), run by Dr. Seth Baum, is in the process of looking at a revised set of guidelines, including a proposed set of utilization management criteria, which they're proposing the PBMs and the payers should be using. In terms of guidelines themselves, both the AHA and the ACC have said it will take some time before they actually get to a final guideline change. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: I think the important information here is that the data demonstrated that lower is better, or as Sean said and as we increasingly hear from experts in the field, lowest is best. And I think people recognize that the current guidelines are out of sync with that. So the data make the point clear, and we expect to see white papers and then ultimately changes in the guidelines. But for right now, the data are an important piece of getting people to understand how to manage this disease for patients. Let's go to the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen. Eric, you may begin your question. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. Just as a follow-on to Ying's question, it sounds like the major bottleneck is this hassle factor, Tony, that physicians are being put through, and I guess I'm just wondering what kind of leverage Amgen has to reduce that factor. Can't payers just stay entrenched and say our policies are that we'll cover it, but we're going to make you go through X, Y, and Z hoops and maintain the hassle factor and I guess the evidence of better medicine? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So, Eric, I don't think I've spoken to a single cardiologist or general practitioner who hasn't commented on how onerous the process is to gain access to these products. I think without a doubt, the third-party organizations, the professional organizations such as the ACC, the AHA, as well as patient organizations such as the FH Foundation are the ones who are running the research work at the moment, including Duke, as I said. We actually looked at those patients who received a PCSK9 and those who didn't, and actually show there's no clinical difference in the patients themselves. This type of burden I think is going to start putting the pressure on the payers. Talking to the payers, they themselves are agreeing with us that the clinical data is important, and they need to expand access to appropriate patients. So we will continue to drive that interaction with them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory, you may begin your question. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon. I have a pretty commercial question on erenumab. I wonder if you can comment on early interactions you're having with payers on that front or maybe just general market research for the product. I guess specifically, I'm wondering how much of an impediment you expect access to be in the early days of that pending launch and how much your research may have factored into the strategic decision to further engage with Novartis. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So let me start, Cory, by just telling you about an interaction I had with my counterpart at Novartis yesterday. He and I have both been in recent contact with neurologists who specialize in treating patients with chronic migraine. And the two of us are quite elated at the level of excitement we're seeing amongst these physicians about having for the first time in decades a treatment opportunity to really help people who have this debilitating disease. It truly is one of those symptomatic diseases where if you've got a migraine, you really know about it, and it impacts how you run your life. Can you run your life or can you be a good caregiver? We are starting our discussions with the payers right now. We are helping them see the data from a clinical perspective. Obviously, the real negotiation can only start once we have the label, and we look forward to having that in the next couple months or so. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Josh, you may begin your question. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks for taking the question. If you can, help us understand the market segmentation in asthma, really the issue with AMG 157 again versus some of the other novel biologics targeting the IL4 side pathways (58:46). Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. The question was a little bit hard to hear, Josh, but I think, Sean, why don't you take the first crack at it? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yes, what I would say is that it's still early days for a lot of the therapies that are still in development. But as you look across the biologics landscape in asthma, there's a few things that are clear. One is that in aggregate, asthma is an enormous opportunity from the perspective of the unmet need and the number of patients who are, for example, having to take courses of oral corticosteroids throughout the course of the year to manage their disease, which is very problematic for them. And I think what you're seeing is that many of the mechanisms that are either out there now in biologics or being developed currently are segmented to populations that, for example, have high eosinophilic counts, atopic phenotype, et cetera. And in the case of TSLP, what we like about TSLP is it is a very upstream kind of a mediator of this inflammation. And our expectation is that we could have a very broad impact on patients with activity across the spectrum of patient phenotypes within the asthma disease spectrum, which would make it a very attractive therapeutic option. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny, you may begin your question. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good evening and thank you for taking my question. I guess the Supreme Court have been looking at the biosimilar law today. In the case they side with you and find that shall means will, can you give us a feel for what will happen with the biosimilars that have already launched for Neulasta? Will they have to come back into the full patent dance? Essentially, if you win this case, what does it mean in terms of delay of biosimilar Neulasta approvals or launches? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: I think there are a couple things in your question there, Ronny. Let me tease apart the two pieces of it. First, as you know, the Supreme Court reviewed this today, and so we'll know within a matter of weeks. Obviously, we think the 180-day needs to be enforced as it was written in the law. But with respect \u2013 I think you must have been referring to the short-acting competitors to NEUPOGEN. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: No, I was talking about the patent dance and impact of Neulasta biosimilar launches. Essentially, if you win that, will the biosimilar Neulasta be delayed? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: I guess I'm not sure what you mean by delayed. I think again, the big picture here, Ronny, is that we've known for some time that we'll face biosimilar competition. We're expecting that that will happen for Neulasta, and we're ready for that. You've seen the actions that we've been taking over the past couple years to be ready for that. And we're ready to embrace the competition, and we've positioned the company from an operating expense standpoint with the knowledge that that competition is coming, and we're launching medicines and entering markets that we think will help us grow beyond that. So the 180-day is obviously post-FDA approval, so we're watching different competitive products make their way through the regulatory pathway. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: If I could then, in terms of the guidance we've offered, there are none that have been approved yet to compete with Neulasta. There's one that's lined up I think in the third quarter here. So if it were approved and the 180-day stands, then that would imply, as we've indicated, that we could face competition as soon as late this year, and that's how our guidance is built right now. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Alethia, you may begin your question. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just again on Neulasta, I know Onpro is picking up momentum. But I'm just trying to figure out if you think \u2013 how do you think this helps defend you against biosimilar share? Is it as simple as that the market is remodeling itself, and so it delays and prolongs some of the competition that you may see, or is there some other dynamic we should be aware of? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Alethia, it's Tony. So let me go back to a comment I made on the last quarter earnings. Let's use MD Anderson as an example of probably one of the premier large oncology teaching centers in the country. It took MD Anderson almost \u2013 just over 12 months to go through their P&T committee to get an agreement within the institution to start shifting patients to Onpro. And the rationale was they were really having a good look at the clinical value, the treatment protocols, the discharge protocols, and they finally agreed that this product was certainly worthwhile having. We spent a number of weeks training their 600 oncology nurses so they were able to really identify the right patient, administer the drug before patients went home, and they have therefore changed the clinical practice. The feedback we get from both the oncology nurses, the oncologists themselves, and patients in fact about the fact they no longer have to come back 24 hours later or a day after their chemotherapy when they're in the middle of chemo-induced nausea and vomiting is a huge advantage and allows them a better quality of life. So we really believe that the benefit this drug brings is not simply a device. It is really something that allows patients to continue to live their lives whilst being treated for cancer. It also has resulted in changes, definitive changes in discharge protocols, which we think will take some time to be reversed if there's no other alternative. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Yes, it's worth keeping in mind the big picture here, Alethia. There's some data in a peer review publication from this week recognizing that there are 100,000 hospitalizations a year in this country from patients who suffer from an infection while undergoing chemotherapy, and of course that's what NEUPOGEN and Neulasta are designed to address. And any product like Onpro that can help prevent some number of those infections is an important product. So there's still an important need in the marketplace. This innovative delivery device enables us to meet a large portion of that need. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Derek, let's go with the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Geoffrey, you may begin your question. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thanks very much and thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up on the question about erenumab, Bob, could you take us through your thinking about the partnering decision? Because you're in a strong net cash position. You've got robust cash flow. You've got plenty of space in your R&D given the sequential trend, and yet you partner one of your two late-stage products for what certainly looks like it's a fairly specialized prescriber base initially. So could you talk a little bit about that, and then also how you'll be collaborating with Novartis on the launch? Particularly, who will be setting price and how you're thinking about price? Thanks. Sorry for the complicated question. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: No, that's fine, Geoff. We'll take it in two parts. Why don't I take the first piece? Then we'll have Tony address some of the specifics in your question. We recognize and we're excited about the opportunity to have a first-in-class and a molecule that we think has a good chance to be best-in-class for a disease where there just aren't good therapies available today, so we're excited about that. But at the same time, Geoff, I think there is a specialty element of this that we don't have experience in. Novartis has been in the neurology neuroscience field for some 60 odd years now, and so they have a real established track record there. And as we interacted with them first with respect to the international markets, I think we came to realize there were opportunities to create a bigger opportunity by combining forces than by going it alone in the international markets. We've come to know and share and respect each other's capabilities over the time since that agreement went into place. And as we looked at the opportunity in the U.S. and our desire to make sure we resource this to win, including getting off to a strong start with the specialist prescribers, it was our view that our shareholders were going to be better served by our joining up with somebody that had a very established presence in this field. So that's our view, and I think all of our interactions since then make us feel confident that that was the right decision for the shareholders. But, Tony, why don't you add your thoughts? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Sure, we've been working with Novartis now from a global research perspective and a global marketing perspective for some time. So the teams have gotten to know each other quite well. My counterpart and I have been drawn into these discussions with these experts, as I said, and he and I are becoming even more increasingly excited about the opportunity to deliver a first-in-class product like this to patients in need. He and I both have experience in terms of launching products in the U.S. over the last five years or so, and we understand some of the barriers and some of the challenges. But we also understand the large unmet need over here. It's clear to us that a strong start in terms of having a clear group of physicians who realize the importance of treating patients properly is going to be important to place pressure on the entire payer system to ensure we can get access. They have a very good presence in the neuroscience market. The feedback we've had from third-party research has shown their team and their medical team are very well regarded, and this strong relationship in our mind will support the ability to launch fast, launch rapidly, and be highly effective in the initial uptake. So they're a good team to be with. We will work closely with them, and I think we can maximize our ability to bring value to patients. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: And, Geoff, as regard to your questions about operational details, obviously those are topics that we discuss with them in detail before we move forward. And we think between the two of us, we think we've got those details worked out. But again, we're excited to have this partnership in hand and we look forward to getting this molecule approved so we can get out and help patients with it. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Great, good luck. Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. Ian, you may begin your question. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you, just another question on Repatha. You made a comment that payers could potentially make some changes over the coming months. I was just hoping to clarify. Are those changes in prior authorization, or are they just payers being more diligent in making sure the right patients are getting access to the therapy? And as I think about ACC.8 (1:09:38), the guideline changes in some of the answers you provided, do you need those changes \u2013 do you need the new guidelines to state lower LDL goals, or what else, what other type of changes could we see which would benefit the PCSK9 class overall? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So, Ian, it's Tony again. So clearly, everything here is driven from the interpretation and understanding about outcomes data, that fundamentally this product, Repatha, on top of maximally tolerated statins, which is the gold standard to date, is able to drive LDL down further and reduce even more dramatically the risk of heart attack and stroke. So the discussions with the payers are consistently around the utilization management criteria to make sure that the burden is less onerous for physicians, that they and patients are able to get access to products quicker and faster. White papers or position papers from professional cardiology organizations are really essential to start paving the way to ensure we move towards the guidelines down the road. But they factor, the good clinical data is what's important. Payers have said to us from the beginning that yes, they see the drug lowers LDL, but they need to understand what that means. The outcomes data now shows you what that means, and all our discussions have been, if we are to renegotiate a contract, it is based around the payers' willingness to amend and make more simple the utilization management criteria. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer, you may begin your question. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC : Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two pipeline questions, if I may. On romosozumab, the upcoming ARCH trial, what percentage of patients were enrolled in Latin America? And secondly on CGRP, I noticed you have a TREADMILL CV safety trial that wrapped up earlier in the year. Any update and/or feedback from that, and was that a study that FDA asked you to do? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Okay, so with respect to ARCH, the percentage of patients in Latin America, I don't remember an exact number, but it is substantially less that it was in the FRAME study, but it is still meaningful. So I think it's about 30% roughly, whereas it was higher than that in FRAME. But I think it's important to recognize that it wasn't the part of the world that the drug was being administered that was the problem. It was the fact that the fracture rates in a placebo-controlled population where physicians were very hesitant to put high-risk individuals into the trial because of the placebo arm, that the fracture rate was so low that we really didn't have any opportunity to demonstrate a further lowering of the fracture rate. And we don't expect that phenomenon in FRAME because the patients that were enrolled were by definition, by protocol, much higher risk. They had to have had prevalent fracture already. They have had much lower T-scores and so on, because in this case, patients are either getting romosozumab followed by alendronate, or alendronate from the get-go with no placebo control. So I wouldn't focus so much around the question of Latin America, although that was where we saw the problem with the very low event rates. And then the other piece to keep in mind is that we do have an event-driven analysis for non-vertebral fracture in ARCH which we didn't have in FRAME. And that also, as you know, addresses this event number powering problem that you can run into, which is essentially the wall we hit in FRAME. With respect to CGRP, I think it's a very good question. One of the things that I learned from talking with people at the meetings in Boston is that the real question in most neurologists' mind right now about the CGRP class remains long-term safety and tolerability. They're very impressed with the efficacy data. They're very impressed with the tolerability and safety that have been observed to date in relatively short exposures in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 study. And so I think there are a number of things that we have been doing specifically as a company, like we have over three years of long-term exposure in open-label extension studies. Other companies, to our knowledge, have not been doing this. We did the CV TREADMILL study on our own volition because we felt that, again, these were going to be kind of questions that would exist in the marketplace. We have a number of pre-clinical and clinical studies, for example, on the impact on blood pressure and so on that would have been done specifically in anticipation of the kind of questions that prescribers will have around the long-term safety of the product. Many of these data are not broadly appreciated because they haven't come out in peer-reviewed publications and they haven't been necessarily presented in plenary type presentations like the Phase 3 data were. But in aggregate, I think these are going to be important and potentially differentiating data for the product. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC : That's very helpful, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Carter, you may begin your question. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Sean, I'll stick with the pipeline theme. On the BLINCYTO studies, you referenced the ALL B-cell (1:15:25). When do you think those data might be presented? Could those be registrational? And on CNP520, is there an interim built into that Alzheimer's study? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yes, so the BLINCYTO studies are just enrolling now, so it's a little bit hard to project when we would be presenting data from them. That depends, of course, on a number of factors in terms of enrollment rate and when we might hit certain milestones with respect to interim analyses and so on. But the program is progressing on plan, and we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm in the marketplace in the clinical trial investigator space, I should say, for the program. And then with respect to the CNP520 program, there are some futility analyses built into the Alzheimer's study, which are designed to cut losses if we weren't seeing some kind of an effect. And I believe there may be also an early stopping efficacy interim late in the trial, though. I'd have to go back and look at the protocol to be sure about that. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Sean, not everybody might be familiar with CNP520. So you just might remind them (1:16:56) Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yes, so you might remember that this was highlighted in The Wall Street Journal the other day. Novartis and Amgen I think had come convergently to the opinion that we have extremely high confidence in the target itself, in large part because of the genetic validation work that was done on this target at deCODE. And so the question is really a question of when to intervene. And what we're doing in this study is enriching for a population, who based on their APOE genotype and age are very highly predisposed to converting from a normal cognitive capability to a minimally impaired cognitive capability. So we're going earlier than anyone else has done to date. This actually may be what's required to demonstrate a disease modifying effect. So the molecule itself is a very high-quality small molecule BACE inhibitor that has been demonstrated to drop A-beta levels dramatically in CSF and all that good stuff. And the main issue strategically is to go in a little bit earlier in this population. And while this is a genetically defined population, about 60% of patients who actually develop Alzheimer's have one of these predisposing alleles. So it's not some tiny little population. It's genetically defined. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoff, you may begin your question. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question, one for Tony or Sean. So in contrast to Repatha, you haven't had a lot of payer pushback on Prolia. So are there payer or pricing lessons to be learned when you think about the romo [romosozumab] launch in July and its combination with Prolia? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Let me take that one, Geoff. The major difference probably between the two is that the majority of Prolia sales are Part B, so it's a buy in bulk model, where Repatha is predominantly a Part D or a retail product we sell. I think it's all around the value proposition, and we go back again to the day we presented at the ACC just to reconfirm that the present net price of Repatha in the marketplace is well within the range of the value proposition or the value-based pricing in fact for this particular product. So I think the two things are different. There was a lot of speculation up front about how the PCSK9s could cost the market $150 billion or whatever it was, which resulted in some silly actions, I think, with all due respect. The drugs continue to show real good BAT value. We're happy to stand up and discuss it anywhere. And how the bank (1:19:54) would pay at the moment is how do you change the utilization management criteria, nothing else. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Raymond James. Chris, you may begin your question. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, thanks. So just a broader question on the biologics market structure and maybe as it relates to your biosimilar business. So we were reading a white paper that I think you guys put out recently on the biosimilar market. I think you guys highlight a real problem. Even under a hypothetical scenario, I think your paper talked about how where a biosimilar is priced at, say, a 25% discount to the innovator, you still have a patient copay that's still higher than the innovative drug. I think in your paper it said almost 40% higher under Medicare Part D. So just curious, you guys seem as close as anyone to policy makers and directions to where this may go, and I know you devoted a great deal of time and energy towards your biosimilar business. I assume that there's an expectation here that some of these disincentives will go away. Can you maybe talk in broad terms how you think that might play out? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Tony, why don't you go ahead and take that? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Sure. One, I don't remember us putting out a white paper, so I just want to make sure that we're not being given authorship of something we didn't write because I'm unaware of Amgen putting out a white paper. We have said historically in the past that we believe that the biosimilar market will move much like a branded generic market; that the pricing in the beginning will be cautious; that the people who come to market and those who actually use biosimilars will be looking for a combination of quality, continuity of quality, continuity of supply, and the reputations of the organizations coming to market. We believe that at Amgen we have a lot of good reputation. We have a 38-year history of never shorting a patient, of having quality product consistently on the marketplace. As we've gone through the process of actually developing these biosimilars ourselves, we've realized how tough it is to actually bring these drugs to market or how to develop them. We've spent time with regulators around the world making sure they understand what good looks like, that the rules and regulations are aligned with what we are doing. There is some debate in the U.S. around linked J-codes between the brand versus the biosimilar. I think those are still being debated at the moment. But until then, it's an unlinked J-code, which means the reimbursement or copays are different. There's a lot happening in the marketplace, and how that could change, I can't speculate now. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Derek, as it's going on 6 :30 on the East Coast, let's take two last questions. Operator : Okay, absolutely. And your next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies. Eun, you may begin your question. Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, a question for Sean. In your collaboration with Arrowhead on RNAi therapies targeting cardiovascular diseases, what's your view on potential safety issues that may be related to RNAi-based therapies? And when do you expect to move into clinic? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yes, I think that the siRNA technologies right now look good enough that in the case where the only way one can drug a target appears to be siRNA-based inhibition, it's a reasonable thing to pursue. And so that's what we're doing, for example, for LPa where we don't feel there's any other way to drug the target. It's not a derisked platform at this point, and there obviously are concerns. And I think that regulators are going to be very cautious in approving products early on that are based on this kind of novel platform, unless of course it's in a setting where there's very high unmet need and no other kind of options. So we are exploring siRNA largely in settings in which the drug can't be \u2013 the target can't be interdicted in other ways, and also where we feel that the therapy would be unique in its ability to address that target. So LPa represents an example like that. We have other targets that we feel are potentially that way. And so at this point, we're moving that ahead. The program is really still in a preclinical stage, but it is moving very rapidly. The collaboration has been great. But I can't really give specific timelines of when it would be in the clinic at this point. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Let's take one last question, and then Bob will make a few closing comments. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Salim Syed. Salim, you may begin your question. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in, just a question on romo maybe for Sean or for Tony. The non-vertebral data, guys, how are you thinking about that in terms of uptake? And then also will we be getting that non-vertebral data in the press release, either in a qualitative form or quantitative form, when we get the top line? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yes. So what I would say is that having evidence of non-vertebral fracture impact is important for cytotherapeutics (1:25:56). Of course, the most important endpoint for physicians, payers, and patients is clinical fracture, which is the symptomatic vertebral fractures which can be very profoundly impactful to patients' quality of life, as well as the long-bone fractures or non-vertebral fractures. And there, we've seen good results, and that's one of the co-primary endpoints for ARCH as well. And I think that it is something that is an important variable. In the end, things like hip fracture are the real dreaded complications of osteoporosis. So having a sense from the aggregate data for a molecule that there can be protection in sites like the hip is important, and that's why we're anticipating ARCH keenly, as it's coming very soon. I can't comment on what we exactly we'll decide to disclose in a press release. We are always focused on very complex embargo requirements by both the society clinical presentation venues as well as the journals that we're trying to publish in, and this can be quite an elaborate dance to figure out what we can put into our press releases in that setting. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Got it, thanks so much. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: All right, thank you all for your questions and for your time. We appreciate it. Maybe just a quick couple of quick thoughts from me and then we'll let you back to work. First, as you heard in our discussion, we're pleased with the volume growth, particularly from our newer products in the quarter. Clearly, there was some noise in the first quarter around Enbrel and the trends. But as you heard us say, we think the long-term trends for Enbrel are on track despite that noise in the marketplace in the first quarter. And again, lastly, we think we've positioned the company well. And as a group here, we're excited about the future given the long-term growth opportunities that we see for Amgen. So thanks for your interest. We'll look forward to talking to you on the second quarter call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC Operator : My name is Skinner and I'll be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Thank you, Skinner. Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for taking the time to participate in our conference call today to review our results for the second quarter. So before we begin, I would like to acknowledge those who are new in their coverage or have changed jobs recently, including Michael Yee, who is now at Jefferies; Andrew Peters at Deutsche Bank; and Matt Phipps at William Blair. Each of us look forward to look working with you. Okay. So let's go ahead and get started with the business at hand. Consistent with the theme that we discussed at the beginning of the year, we delivered a quarter with strong volume growth, volume driven growth of our newer products, which of course will be key for a long-term growth strategy. So leading our call today is our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, who will provide a brief strategic update followed by our CFO, David Meline, who will review our financial results for the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2017. Our head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will then discuss our product performance during the quarter, followed by our head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. We will be using slides for our presentation today, which have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by email. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful in understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release, our Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website. So just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements and our 2017 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and let me thank all of you for joining our call. Halfway through the year, we remain on track to achieve our objectives for 2017 as well as our longer-term objectives. Our second quarter financial performance was enabled by strong volume-driven growth for our newer products including Prolia, KYPROLIS and Repatha, as well as our other more recently launched drugs. This is encouraging as we continue to believe that such volume-driven growth is a key ingredient for long-term success in this industry. Our transformation efforts are enabling us to make significant investments in our pipeline and new product launches while still delivering near-term operating leverage. And you see that reflected in our 9% operating income growth and our 15% earnings per share growth this quarter. Our margin trends also reflect the success of our ongoing transformation. We continue to generate strong cash flows, enabling us to return significant cash to shareholders including almost $2 billion in the second quarter alone in share repurchases and dividends. Strong cash flows, combined with a strong balance sheet, give us the strategic flexibility we want to invest in external innovation. We're continually looking at opportunities in our chosen therapeutic categories, yet we remain disciplined in our approach to looking for investments that will enable our shareholders to prosper. Turning to our product highlights, I want to start with our cardiovascular business and Repatha, which we expect to be a significant contributor to our long-term volume-driven growth. Our focus right now is on improving Repatha patient access in the U.S. and around the world, and with our outcomes data in hand, we're making progress. I was pleased to see the swift updates to cholesterol treatment guidelines and recommendations from four leading professional societies interested in atherosclerosis and expect more to come. This change in professional opinion is an important precursor for growth in the market. Additionally, our recent discussions with U.S. payers about Repatha and the need to improve the utilization management process have been constructive, again reflecting the strength of our data. Finally, we submitted our outcomes data to regulators this quarter and look forward to being able to incorporate them into our label following regulatory review. Within oncology, I want to highlight a few recent notable milestones. First in multiple myeloma, we completed two pivotal studies showing an overall survival benefit for KYPROLIS patients with relapsed disease, underscoring our confidence in this molecule as the new standard of care for these patients. And similarly, in relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia, BLINCYTO demonstrated an overall survival benefit versus standard of care chemotherapy. I would remind you that BLINCYTO is the first and only bispecific T-cell engager to have done that. Overall survival is the gold standard when it comes to oncology drug development and we were encouraged to be able to show that patients live longer when treated with KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO. In neuroscience, we're getting closer to being able to make a meaningful impact in the lives of migraine patients. We submitted erenumab for which we have the brand name Aimovig to U.S. regulators in the second quarter. We have the lead position in this exciting new class of medicines, combining our commercial strengths in specialty biologics, with Novartis' established infrastructure in neuroscience, we think positions us to win in this segment. Our biosimilars programs continue to advance nicely and the quality of our work here was on display once again in the recent FDA panel review of our biosimilar to Avastin. The outlook for the company remains strong. With growth from newer products and effective lifecycle management of our legacy products, we're confident in our position and looking forward to the second half of the year. Let me now turn to David to review the financial performance of the business. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Bob. We were very pleased with our consistent revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter as our transformation efforts continue to enable investment in our core business, while also delivering operating leverage in a period of portfolio transition and in a competitive environment. Turning to the financial results on page 6 of the slide deck, worldwide revenues at $5.8 billion in the second quarter grew 2% year-over-year. This quarter we also saw product sales at $5.6 billion, growing 2% on a year-over-year as well, as strong unit growth demand for our newer products outweighed declines in the mature brands. We were particularly encouraged by our 11% year-over-year volume growth in Europe, reflecting the value of our innovative products in a market where we have experienced biosimilar competition and portfolio transition for a number of years. Other revenues at $236 million grew 10% versus the second quarter of 2016, driven by higher IBRANCE royalty revenue offset partially by decreased Nexavar royalty revenue. Changes in foreign exchange had a 1% negative impact to total revenue and product sales in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating income at $3.1 billion grew 9% from the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved 3.8 points to 55.2% for the quarter, reflecting positive revenue performance, continued favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories and the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment in Q4 of 2016. On a full-year basis, we expect another year of strong operating margins driven by tight operational expense management. We expect to see our typical trend of higher operating expenses during the second half of the year. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales improved by 0.8 points to 12.7% driven by reduced royalties. Research and development expenses at $851 million were down 3% year-over-year, driven by lower spending required to support certain later stage clinical programs and continued benefits from our transformation initiatives and process improvement efforts. R&D as a percent of sales was 15.3% in the second quarter. We expect research and development as a percent of product sales to approach 2016 levels in the second half of the year. SG&A expenses decreased 7% on a year-over-year basis due to the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment, partially offset by increased investments in product launches. In aggregate, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 5% year-over-year and remain on track to meet or exceed our 2018 commitment of $1.5 billion in transformation savings, while investing to build the business globally, support new product launches and investing in the long-term pipeline for the business. Other income and expenses were a net $156 million expense in Q2. This is favorable by $20 million on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by higher cash balances. The non-GAAP tax rate was 17.4% for the quarter, a 1.2 point decrease versus the second quarter of 2016. This decrease reflects discrete benefits associated with the settlement of certain state and federal tax matters and favorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings, offset partially by a prior-year benefit associated with tax incentives. Non-GAAP net income increased 12% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 15% year-over-year for the second quarter to $3.27 per share. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 7, free cash flow was $2.1 billion for the quarter compared to free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the second quarter of 2016, driven by timing impacts of income tax payments to the IRS. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders, consistent with our commitments as we deployed $1 billion to repurchase 6.2 million shares at an average of $162 per share and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion as previously communicated. Additionally, our second quarter dividend of $1.15 per share is an increase of 15% over last year. This reflects our balanced approach to capital allocation, with significant investment in innovation in support of long-term growth of the business, as well as return of cash to shareholders. We continue to maintain financial and strategic flexibility as a result of our strengthening balance sheet position. Cash and investments total $39.2 billion, an increase of $4.2 billion from the second quarter of last year. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow generation. Our debt balance stands at $35.1 billion as of June 30, carrying a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of 13 years. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2017 on page 8. Overall, our revised 2017 revenue guidance is $22.5 billion to $23 billion. Our first 2017 volume and price performance was in line with our plans, as we experienced a solid contribution from our newer products while managing the impact of competition against the balance of the portfolio. This range also reflects the potential impact during the remainder of 2017 from the outcome of Repatha litigation and potential for improved access for appropriate patients as a result of the positive Repatha outcomes data and professional society guidelines and recommendation updates. Our guidance assumes no new U.S. biosimilar competition in 2017. With regard to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we are raising and narrowing the outlook to $12.15 to $12.65 per share, reflecting our overall solid first half 2017 performance and continued operational expense management. Further, we are confirming our non-GAAP tax guidance at 18.5% to 19.5%. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year. Finally, consistent with our 2017 outlook, we remain confident that we will meet or exceed the commitments we provided for the 2014 to 2018 period including double digit non-GAAP EPS growth, non-GAAP operating margin improvement from 38% to 52% to 54%, $1.5 billion of transformation savings and return to shareholders of at least 60% of non-GAAP net income on average during the period. This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Thank you, David, and you'll find the sales details starting on slide number 10. We delivered a strong solid quarter with sales increasing 2% year-over-year. Prolia and our more recently launched brands including Repatha and KYPROLIS continue to deliver strong volume growth. We are focused on their near-term growth and realizing their long-term potential as the product portfolio continues to transom. For the quarter, sales in the U.S. increased 2% year-over-year while sales outside the U.S. increased 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange or 3% including. Internationally we had double-digit volume growth led by our European business. Let me begin first with Prolia. Prolia sales increased 15% with an 18% volume growth year-over-year, with share gains in both the U.S. and our international markets. Prolia continues to offer a unique opportunity to both post-menopausal osteoporosis patients as well as Amgen. There are currently about 3.5 million patients on Prolia globally relatively equally distributed across the regions, about 1 million in the U.S., about 1.6 million in Europe and the rest of the world about 1 million. Elderly patients who suffer bone fractures often become bedridden and face potential loss of their independence. This places an enormous economic burden on society and less than half the diagnosed patients are treated, raising the need for improved education and treatment guidelines. This is what we as a company are focusing on next. Prolia's average share of treated patients is around 20%, both in the U.S. and globally. However, there are some countries such as Australia, Switzerland and Ireland, where better diagnosis and treatment rates for osteoporosis have led to Prolia having 50% share or better. These are countries that truly understand the societal cost of non-intervention. Prolia has a strong clinical profile with a proven ability to reduce risk of fractures. Combined with solid long-term safety data spanning over 10 years and a convenient twice per year administration schedule, Prolia will remain an important growth driver and we will continue to target our commercial efforts on improving diagnosis, treatment rates and duration in order to drive access to a greater number of these patients. KYPROLIS grew 23% year-over-year, led by our successful launch efforts across existing and new markets outside the United States. Uptake continues to be robust across the launch markets with a 20% sequential volume growth. As Bob mentioned, KYPROLIS has developed two sets of exciting overall survival data in relapsed multiple myeloma patients this year. Earlier in the year in the head-to-head ENDEAVOR study against VELCADE, we demonstrated that the KRYPOLIS arm reduced the risk of death by 21% and improved overall survival by about eight months compared to the VELCADE arm. Just recently, the ASPIRE study demonstrated that adding KYPROLIS to REVLIMID and dexamethasone also reduced the risk of death by 21% and improves survival by about eight months. It is clear. Multiple myeloma patients live longer when treated with KYPROLIS. With these two new sets of overall survival data, our message to physicians is simple and powerful. When multiple myeloma relapses, don't put your patient's survival at risk. KYPROLIS-based regimens KRd and Kd reduce the risk of death by 21% versus Rd and Vd and extended overall survival by 7.9 and 7.6 months respectively. This data will also help community oncologists better understand the risk/benefit ratio of profile of KYPROLIS versus other options. XGEVA grew 4% year-over-year, mostly due to volume. We look forward to having the positive multiple myeloma study data added to our label in 2018, which will expand the eligible patient population and provide a new growth opportunity for XGEVA. For Nplate and Vectibix, we continue to see strong volume growth in both brands. Vectibix has now over 50% share of the U.S. EGFR segment. Our recent label update, which includes expanded RAS testing, demonstrates Amgen's ongoing commitment to using cutting edge science and technology to target treatments to patients most likely to benefit. Turning now to Neulasta. We continue to drive adoption of Neulasta Onpro, exiting the second quarter with about 55% share of Neulasta sales. The treatment and convenience benefits to patients and providers is clear, as penetration continues to improve in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens. I'd point out, however, as we look at the cancer therapy in total, PD1s and other new novel therapies are causing a low single digit decline in the usage of myelosuppressive agents. We've also seen a small share loss internationally and we believe these factors contributed to the year-over-year decline of about 5%. The quarter-over-quarter decline of 10% was primarily due to heavier purchasing by certain end customers and favorable accounting adjustments in the first quarter. We expect the trend in myelosuppressive regimens to continue for the remainder of the year. I'd point out, however, that in spite of decreased use of myelosuppressive regimens, there has been an increase in the number of hospital admissions for febrile neutropenia and we continue to focus on improving penetration for the benefit of patients and for the reduction of unnecessary hospitalization costs. Looking forward, I'd remind you that the fourth quarter of 2016 also included a single $38 million purchase from the U.S. government. NEUPOGEN declined 30% year-over-year. The impact of short-acting biosimilar competition on NEUPOGEN in the U.S. was in line with prior trends. We exited the second quarter holding 44% share for the short-acting segment and importantly have maintained pricing discipline over the three-plus years since NEUPOGEN first faced competition in the U.S. We expect the competitive dynamic to continue through the rest of 2017. Enbrel sales declined 1% year-over-year but increased 24% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. In the first quarter, you'll recall that market volume growth rates in both rheumatology and dermatology segments had contracted from recent levels. As we expected, in the second quarter, market volume growth improved in both segments. We expect year-over-year segment growth trends to approximate these recent levels for the balance of the year. Sequentially, our unit share was relatively stable in both rheumatology and dermatology, declining less than 1 percentage point to 31% in rheumatology and 15% in dermatology. Changes in net selling price had a positive impact on Enbrel's sequential growth. Recall that quarter one was negatively impacted by increased commercial co-pay assistance. As calculated on a full year basis, we continue to expect year-over-year impact of changes in net selling price to be negligible. We estimate that we exited the second quarter with a balance of about $140 million of excess end-user inventory. We expect a portion of this excess inventory to deplete through the remaining of the year. In summary, we saw improvement in the underlying segment performance this quarter versus the prior quarter and our share trajectory continues as previously projected. Enbrel has a strong track record of safety and efficacy in treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. We continue to believe the long-term dynamics are intact and continue to invest in Enbrel to remain competitive in these growing segments. Aranesp grew 6% year-over-year, primarily from volume growth, which includes a benefit from some timing of tenders in certain markets outside the U.S. versus the prior year. With EPOGEN, we've been executing our lifecycle management strategy by successfully transitioning much of the dialysis business to Aranesp and extending our supply contract with DaVita through 2022. The transition to Aranesp is largely complete and the second quarter year-over-year decline in EPOGEN is primarily due to lower net prices as a result of the DaVita agreement. We believe that for now our EPOGEN volumes have stabilized. Sensipar year-over-year growth of 10% was mainly due to net selling price and to a lesser extent unit growth. We continue to await CMS guidance on the reimbursement mechanism for Parsabiv. Parsabiv launch is underway in Europe with seven markets so far and three more expected by year-end. In conclusion, let me turn to Repatha. We continue to extend our market leadership across the U.S. and Europe. We now hold 58% share of the PCSK9 segment in both markets, with sequential growth points of 4% in the U.S. and 2 points in Europe. More importantly in the U.S., new-to-brand patient share averaged 70% in the second quarter. Since March, and the presentation of the positive Repatha outcomes data, we have been engaging with payers to improve their utilization of management criteria and processes to improve access for appropriate patients. Payers and PBMs acknowledge the benefit to patients demonstrated by the outcomes data and are evaluating changes to their processes. We continue to believe that Repatha will grow steadily as guidelines and clinical pathways are revised and the outcome data are in our label. We look forward to the publication of the final update of the ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway, an important reference for physicians. Cardiovascular disease continues to be the number one cause of death and disability in the world. Repatha has the potential to help millions of patients around the world dealing with this grievous illness. Let me close by thanking all the Amgen staff who worked so hard and tirelessly to get important products to patients around the world. I'll now provide you (26:00) to Dr. Sean Harper. Sean? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. I'll begin my comments today with an update on our cardiovascular efforts. In Q2 we submitted our Repatha outcomes data to global regulators and we look forward to working with them to include this important update to the prescribing information. I have also been very encouraged to see multiple professional societies updating their expert consensus documents and guidelines on the use of PCSK9 inhibitors including the U.S. National Lipid Association, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society, clearly reflecting the importance of our Repatha outcomes data. In addition, a draft version of the 2017 update of the ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on non-statin therapies for LDL cholesterol lowering has recently been made available for public comment. These decision pathways are intended, among other things, to provide guidance to clinicians in areas where clinical evidence is new and evolving. While the document is still in draft form, we find the concepts within to well reflect the excellent safety profile and efficacy of Repatha and to suggest evidence-based utilization in appropriate patient populations. We expect the final publication of this document in Q3 of this year. Beyond Repatha, we've advanced our ASGR1 inhibitor into the clinic in the form of an antibody. As it is just over a year since we first published the strong genetic association of ASGR1 variance with cardiovascular disease in The New England Journal of Medicine, a rapid movement into the clinic demonstrates the speed at which we're able to move programs forward when we have human validation of the sort that deCODE Genetics can provide to ultimately improve R&D productivity. We also have additional modalities directed against this target under pre-clinical investigation. Our omecamtiv mecarbil Phase 3 outcome study in heart failure continues to enroll briskly, demonstrating the interest in an innovative new add-on therapy in an area in which significant unmet need still exists. And finally, we're looking forward to the presentation of the anacetrapib REVEAL study by Merck to help to inform our plans for our own CETP inhibitor, AMG 899. Turning to oncology, we recently received our second positive overall survival result with KYPROLIS, this time from the ASPIRE study. We clearly demonstrated KYPROLIS' superiority to VELCADE with improved overall survival in the ENDEAVOR study of KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone versus VELCADE plus dexamethasone and now we've demonstrated positive survival benefit from KYPROLIS plus REVLIMID plus dexamethasone versus REVLIMID plus dexamethasone in the ASPIRE study. In each case, KYPROLIS reduced the risk of death by 21% and improved survival by approximately eight months, a very meaningful clinical result that reinforces the role for KYPROLIS in driving deep and durable responses. We have already submitted the ENDEAVOR overall survival data to regulators for inclusion in the labels and we are preparing the ASPIRE data for submission as well. And lastly on KYPROLIS, our Phase 3 study in combination with DARZALEX in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma began enrolling patients in the second quarter. At ASCO, we had the opportunity to present Phase 2 data from our combination study of IMLYGIC and YERVOY in metastatic melanoma, where we saw an approximate doubling of the response rate compared to YERVOY alone with no unexpected toxicities. This was an important proof of concept for combining the complementary mechanisms of an oncolytic viral immunotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor to enhance antitumor effects. There is significant interest in exploring IMLYGIC with other checkpoint inhibitors in a variety of tumor types. In regulatory news, we received a February 2018 PDUFA date for our XGEVA submission for the prevention of skeletal-related events in multiple myeloma patients. We also received full approval for BLINCYTO in the U.S. The approval expands the indication of BLINCYTO for the treatment of relapsed or refractory ALL in adults and now children and included overall survival data and an indication for Philadelphia chromosome-positive forms of the disease. Also within our BiTE platform, we are advancing AMG 673, our half-life extended anti-CD33 BiTE into the clinic with first in human testing in AML patients to begin soon. And lastly, we received a label update for Vectibix to more precisely molecularly define a population with wild-type RAS for treatment in colorectal cancer. In our bone health therapeutic area, as expected, we have received a complete response letter for EVENITY from the FDA and will be responding with data from the ARCH study and the BRIDGE study in men with osteoporosis. Along with our colleagues at UCB, we're currently in the process of reviewing the detailed ARCH data with experts. This will be a Class II resubmission in the U.S., which carries a six-month review timeline. We believe there are patients for whom the benefit/risk of EVENITY would be favorable and we will work with regulators on a path forward. In our neuroscience collaboration with Novartis, we've submitted erenumab, now known as Aimovig, to global regulators for the prevention of migraine and have received a PDUFA date of May 17, 2018. We recently presented data from our Aimovig program at U.S. and EU medical conferences, and the feedback on the efficacy and safety profile continues to be very positive. In our beta secretase program for Alzheimer's disease, we're expanding the development of CNP520 to individuals who carry one copy of the ApoE4 allele and also have evidence of brain amyloid accumulation. This will be assessed in an approximately 2,000 subject trial that will be starting soon, and combined with the ongoing Phase 3 study evaluating CNP520 and ApoE4 homozygotes, will constitute a robust data set in an at-risk population. Given how early beta amyloid starts to accumulate in the course of the disease, we feel that a therapy like a BACE1 inhibitor should be administered as early as is feasible. This, combined with the strong genetic validation for specifically targeting BACE via deCODE's work, gives us great confidence in our approach. And finally, in our biosimilars program, we received a unanimous vote from an FDA advisory committee in favor of approval of ABP 215, our biosimilar Avastin, which has a user fee action date in September of this year. As always, I want to thank our staff for continuing to deliver on these important milestones for the benefit of patients. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Sean. And Skinner, let's open the line up for questions, and please remind our callers about the process for asking this afternoon. Operator : Absolutely. Our first question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, everybody, and good afternoon. If I could just ask a clarifying question here on Enbrel, that would be helpful. So I believe you said in the fourth quarter you had a $150 million inventory build and then, I can't remember, I think you either said you had a $20 million or $30 million burn-off in the first quarter. Now you've said you're back at $140 million. So can you just review for us the sequential pattern here? And did you have an inventory build quarter over quarter? And I guess should we expect all of this $140 million to burn off in the second half of the year or how do you expect that to play out? Thanks very much. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Matthew. Ask Tony to respond. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Matt, it's Tony. So let me get back to discussing the inventory. So inventory, as we said, we report at a point in time. So it's either on March 31 or it is June 30. So it's an endpoint. What we have in hand is we know exactly what the revenue numbers are in terms of ex-factory sales. We also understand what our in-market demand is based on the IMS retail prescriptions, which are about 90% accurate and 10% predicted. We also understand exactly what is held by the wholesalers because of our contracts with them and the triangulation between how much has been sold from wholesalers to end users minus the demand leaves us with a number which we then extrapolate as being the end-user inventory. So clearly what happens is, at the beginning of the quarter, there's a drawdown of that inventory, which we did see in April-May this year, and then there appeared to be a build towards the end of June. So what I'm saying is we ended the quarter with an excess of about $140 million of inventory, which I would expect to burn off the majority of that during the rest of the year. Arvind Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Skinner, let's take the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for the question, and congrats on a solid quarter. Maybe for Sean on these ACC Decision Pathway document that's going to be coming out here shortly. Can you just talk about what the impact of the decision pathway is relative to, I don't know, the actual treatment guidelines, which I think the ACC expects to put out in 2018? And also, if you think there's going to be an immediate or relatively near-term impact for the decision pathways document, what payers have to maybe do to comply? Thanks. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yes. It's a great question. I mean I think that, in my experience with these documents, the guideline process is one which is quite complex, involves a systematic review of the world's literature by a very large group of international experts and has to kind of occur on a cadence of every two to three years. And also, the result is, if you've ever looked at one of these guidelines, it's a long complex technical document designed for people who are really expert in the field. Because of that cadence, and because of the need to produce something that is more usable to the practicing clinician, these pathway documents emerged, and they are important reference documents for physicians to think about how to deal with patients who come in and present themselves. And this is the first time, to my knowledge, that one of these pathway documents has been updated outside of its normal schedule and that's because the pathway documents, in part, are designed to deal with just this situation where new important clinical information, particularly the quality of information that's come from both our outcomes trial as well as the Pfizer outcomes trial with PCSK9 have come on the scene and publications have become available. So it's an important step. This is a document that is used quite a bit in clinical decision making, and generally speaking but not always, these kind of changes that you see in these documents then roll in and become incorporated in the formal guidelines which will come out, as you say, probably 2018, late 2018 is our best knowledge. In terms of immediate impact, I'd say it's a little bit hard to judge. I think there's an accumulating weight of evidence that the professional societies around the world, including very important ones in the U.S. like the Lipid Society and the endocrine societies and now ACC are beginning to converge in their opinions around the importance of LDL lowering and the impact that one sees, both the safety profile as well as the efficacy of using Repatha in particular. And so I do expect that payers will responsibly look at these guidelines and recommendations and begin to try to make it possible for the doctors who practice in their plans to practice in a way that's consistent with these professional recommendations. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: And Eric, why don't we ask Tony to share a few thoughts as well on the payer perspective in your question. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So I mean, it's clear to us, Eric, that in our discussion with the payers, they do pay very careful attention to position papers and the guidelines coming from these bodies. And the National Lipid Association is a subdivision of the AHA. So it's clear that they're making those decisions on that regard. The ACC, of course, has always been the grand-daddy of guidelines and people will pay definitive attention and look at how they will be actually servicing patients aligned with these position papers or pathways that the ACC are put into place. So we're working extensively with them at the moment. As Sean says, as the weight of evidence continues to build around the importance of delivering Repatha to patients who do have this particular disease. Operator : Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one has to do with the balance sheet. You have a $39 billion cash on balance sheet. If you guys don't have any plans to consummate M&A transactions or repay the debt, many investors are just wondering whether you have any plans to repurchase a significant portion of the float for the shares. And then maybe for Sean, when might you know whether FDA would require a cardiovascular safety study for romosozumab? And if so, would you continue the development or not for romosozumab? Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Ying, why don't I take the first question, invite David to add any color if he'd like and then, Sean, you can briefly answer the romo question. On, with respect to the balance sheet, I think again you're aware that our business is generating significant cash flows. We have a track record of wanting to use that cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders, a rapidly growing dividend as well as to buy back stock and to invest in the business. So we're optimistic about the outlook for the business. As I say, continue to generate strong cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet and we'll look at ways of deploying that capital as appropriate through time. And, David, maybe you'd like to update where we are with respect to the capital commitments that we've made to our shareholders. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Yes. So I would just add to that two things. One is that we continue with the plan as I said to return 60% of net income through 2018 to shareholders and I think that is certainly something we'll execute on going forward. And I think the second point, as many know, the vast majority of the cash that we're holding does sit offshore and we don't see right now that it would be appropriate to repatriate it under the current U.S. tax system. So obviously as and when they make progress on tax reform and make it more reasonable to consider repatriation, would we then take a look and start providing some commentary on how we might deploy that. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, and with respect to romosozumab, I think it's just too early in the process to comment meaningfully on whether additional studies would be appropriate and whether they would be a good investment for our shareholders and UCB's shareholders. We have to go through a process that's going to take some time to discuss these results formally with regulators. Operator : Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-part for me. Just wondering following the romo safety signal, if your BD priorities have changed at all either with respect to size, stage or disease areas of interest. And then on the guidance, just wondering if you can talk about the changes on the revenue side, particularly lowering at the top end, what the driver or drivers of that was. Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: We'll do this in two parts as well then. With respect to romo and the impact on our BD thinking, I don't think it has any direct impact, Terence, on how we're looking at the opportunities of business development. David, do you want to talk a little bit more about guidance? David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Sure. In terms of guidance, if you might recall when we entered the year, we provided revenue guidance that was broader than traditionally we would have, because of in particular the uncertainties around the evolution of the sales of Repatha, which related to this question of the outcomes trial being published as well as the ongoing litigation that's taking place. And so now as we sit at midyear and look at the trajectory of the business, the good news for us is the revenue is evolving as we'd set out for the company through the year and indeed the earnings performance is quite good and we've raised again our EPS for the year. So really, what we're doing now is we're narrowing the guidance to reflect the fact that as we look to the balance of the year, we don't have the most positive upside that might have occurred if there had been an early decision on the litigation. We're awaiting the outcome of that and then we're also reflecting the trajectory which we're encouraged by the uptake of Repatha which we think will continue to accelerate. And so the guidance simply reflects the best estimate we have right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC : Thanks so much for the question. My question is in relation to your longer-term guidance and your margin guidance for 52% to 54%. You're at the higher end of that and next year you're not necessarily going to face so much biosimilar competition. So can you talk about where and when you could think about reassessing that? And importantly, if you think that these margins can be sustained or managed even in the face of potential future biosimilar risk? Thanks so much. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, so I would say first of all on \u2013 you're correct on our margin performance. We've been pleased with how it's evolved for the company given that we set that goal out at a time we were delivering 38% operating margin. So it was quite a big task for the company, but you've seen it evolve very nicely. And I think importantly for us during that time, we've also stood up a very significant cardiovascular franchise. We're in the process today of investing in preparation of our first launch in the neurology sector. We've been building out and are on track with our portfolio of biosimilars and we've added several hundred million dollars a year of structural cost to a international network as we built out globally. So not only are we seeing margin improvement, but also we'd been building a base for the company which is going to be very important for our sustainability going forward. In terms of as and when we would then look forward and what do we think about margins for the company, I would say we're approaching now the end of the period that we gave guidance through 2018. So obviously, within this next year, year-and-a-half, we'll have a look and start providing some additional views of the future for the company. But at least as we sit here today, we feel very good about not only the performance of the company and the prospects but also the sustainability of that profitability. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners LLC. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you very much, and congratulations everybody on a solid quarter. I just wanted to have a little discussion on Aimovig or hear your thoughts on it. You've said that you're likely to be first, and I know you can't really comment on pricing, but certainly the PCSK9 experience was sobering for all of us in terms of the payer response. And I'm just wondering how your discussions with payers are going. What sort of step edits you would expect for people to get access to Aimovig and should we be expecting pricing that's more at the Prolia end of the spectrum or more at the Repatha end of the spectrum? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So, Geoff, it's Tony. I mean, one, we've never given pricing guidance prior to a launch. Aimovig is going into a patient population that are uniquely different from a symptomatic perspective, right. So we estimate about 3.4 million patients presently on prophylactic treatment for migraine, both episodic and chronic, which is a crippling disease resulting in mothers not being able to be mothers, or employees not being able to do their work. And our discussions have been with payers from a clinical perspective at this particular stage as we move things forward. And there's a huge unmet need, and we're busy developing our pharmaco-economic value-based pricing models for this particular disease. It's going to be a competitive market. That we understand. But our pricing will be made as we get closer to the launch time. Operator : Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital Markets. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks for taking my questions, and congratulations on the solid quarter. I was just trying to better understand the drivers of Repatha until we get to the publication of the ACC treatment guidelines at the end of next year. Specifically, just two different, two sub groups that the payers and physicians have a lot of interest in, seeing results for diabetic, smokers. And then just separately at the time of the ACC presentation, the follow-up was roughly 2.2 years. Was wondering when we could see follow-up or data following up patients for greater than three years. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Why don't we do this in two parts. Tony, why don't you talk a little bit about what we expect to see between now and when we have the outcomes data in the label, what the drivers are. And then, Sean, you can address the follow-up question. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So when we look at the actual usage in the marketplace, right, there are sort of three patient segments that are pathing to us that are clearly indicated inside the label, and aware physicians are starting to understand they're important to treat, right. These are patients who have ASCVD, who've had two events in the last 24 months, clearly high-risk patients or what we call higher high-risk patients. They are those who have ACS who have had an event in the last year or so with ASCVD. And then there's the FH population. And that's a fairly large population, and we've seen the majority of our patients coming from that group at the moment. If you look at the NRx data, which is really looking at the new-to-brand prescriptions in terms of new patient capture, you are seeing that we are gaining market share there and gaining traction consistency in terms of getting patients. When you look inside the data and you see that our abandonment rate by commercial patients has gone down to about 24%, it is clear that we are assisting patients who can't afford their co-pay or their deductible. So we're getting a higher access to patients there. So we see a continued usage and expansion by existing physicians. We are capturing about between 300 and 400 new prescribers per month, so the prescriber base is growing as we go forward. The new guidelines are starting to take a little bit of traction. Physicians understand. We look forward to the ACC presentations. So that's where we see the growth of our business right now. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: And with respect to the insights into the data on diabetics and smokers, there were a very substantial portion of Type 2 diabetics in FOURIER, and about 30% of the population were smokers. And essentially when you looked at those subgroups in comparison to the whole study, the data were virtually identical. So there we did see, as you might expect, with LDL lowering, as has been seen with statins, that it has the sort of uniform effect across these type of clinical populations. Obviously, the controlled portion of the FOURIER study is complete, but there is \u2013 I think you are referring to long-term extension kind of data that is available. As you might recall, we had over four years of long-term extension data, treatment data, at the time of presentation of FOURIER published at that time in one of the major journals. And we have a long-term extension of approximately 5,000 patients from FOURIER as well who will run out for an additional number of years, perhaps up to 10. We'll figure that out as we go along. But that is designed to be a leading indicator of any safety issues that might not have presented themselves in the window of the FOURIER study, which was, as you point out, just 2.2 years. Operator : And our next question comes from Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I have one on Repatha for either Sean or Tony. And I guess the question is more in demand trends post-ACC in this year. I'm just trying to get a sense for when payer policy and guidelines become more favorable? If you guys would expect any hurdles at the actual prescriber level at the cardiovascular \u2013 at the treating physician level or if patient persistence rates over time have really changed materially? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So, Geoff, let me take that one as best I can in the moment. So just to remind you, that the outcomes data was presented at the ACC in March. We are not promoting that data at the moment. We are clearly awaiting the FDA decision to include the data in our label, at which stage we will start being able to promote that data into the marketplace itself. We are working consistently with the payers at the moment in terms of reevaluating and challenging some of the utilization management criteria, challenging some of the onerous processes that are in place and actually working with the professional bodies themselves so they become involved in ensuring they can get access to their patients. We have seen a high level of willingness from the payers and the PBMs to relook at their utilization management criteria to ensure that the processes are reasonable. The cohorts are probably a bit too small to be able to really understand patient persistency at the moment, so what we are tracking is new patient capture early on, and as you know, you can see that quite easily from the IMS data. And that continues to grow as well as the growth trial as (55:06) we go forward. We do believe that once the FDA ratifies the data and puts it in the label, we'll be in a much better position to see an opening of access through the payers. Operator : Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, guys, and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on erenumab. And on their call this morning, Lilly mentioned that they that haven't seen any competitive CGRP data that they view as better than what they've generated. So I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about how you see this market and how you maybe plan to potentially differentiate erenumab or Aimovig in the study as you begin to get a better feel for the various profiles of other agents in the class? Or is this something that really just comes down to first to market and potentially price, as you were asked about before? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. So let me start doing a little bit of an answer there if I can, and perhaps Sean can add around the clinical data. Right, so just to go back, my comment to Geoff earlier on, around the unmet need, the more we dig into this market, the more you realize that not only patients but specialist physicians themselves have been absolutely frustrated for decades because of the inability to actually prescribe a migraine drug for a migraine. They've used substitutes. They've used drugs that have caused huge side effects, and patients are unhappy with them. So as we've talked to patients, patient bloggers, patient groups about their needs, it's clear the unmet need continues to be large. Every specialist I've spoken to who looked at the Aimovig data has been impressed by the data, has seen a dramatic potential for change in what this will do for patients on their day-to-day lives. We do believe that we will be first to market. We have submitted first. We intend coming to market first. We have a partnership with Novartis who have an existing strong relationship with the neurologists, a lot of them who treat migraine. And we expect to be using their skills, competencies and relationships to set us up and to move fast and quickly into the marketplace. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: And my only additional comment would be that because the other agents are not receptor antagonists and are ligand directed, they're less potent, and the amount of antibody required to achieve the clinical effect is considerably higher. This results in things like loading doses or IV administration or multiple large volume sub-Q administrations required at the same time, and none of those are positives for patients. So we know we can get erenumab to a monthly single small-volume well-tolerated auto injection. I don't know that that's possible with these other agents. The data as it appears to me at this point doesn't suggest that. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Skinner, let's move on. We've got I know quite a few questions still lined up to go, and we're pressing up against the top of the hour. But we'll do our best to get to the remaining questions. Let's go ahead. Operator : Absolutely. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. So given the pushback so far with the payers in the cardiovascular space that you've seen with Repatha, like how are you thinking about the bar for developing your CETP inhibitor? And what threshold do you want to see with the Merck data that will make you feel more positive about the prospect of the class? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: I think we're focused, Robyn, on that medical need and trying to figure out whether that aid class of agents has a role to play. But Sean, I'll let you talk about the specifics. And obviously we need to believe that we can earn a return on any further investment there for our shareholders. Do you want to talk about the clinical piece? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yes. No, I mean, I think that it's the case that if we were to see as we did with the PCSK9s that have been assessed in outcomes trials, a linear relationship as has occurred with statins between LDL lowering and event-rate risk, and the agents are lowering LDL in the range of 30% to 35%, 40%, that an oral agent that could do that as an add-on to statins would be a meaningful drug to have in the armamentarium. It's obviously not going to deliver the kind of LDL reductions you can achieve with the PCSK9 antibody, but because the drugs are oral and so on, we feel they play a role. What remains to be seen is whether these agents, based on their LDL lowering capacity, and the Merck drug will be the first that I think will answer this question more definitively. Whether we see that relationship or whether we're seeing some fractional effect of that relationship, and that the effect on cardiovascular risk is marginal, in which case obviously we'd be much less excited about pursuing this. So I think it much depends on the details of the reveal data. Operator : Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI : Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. Just to focus on the PCSK9 a bit. In a scenario where there's no meaningful inflection for Repatha post-guideline updates, would you potentially consider the idea of a pricing reset? And then also, do you think Novartis CANTOS data impacts PCSK9 opportunity at all? Was very curious to have your take on it. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Umer, this is Tony. I think a lack of inflection would be a terrible tragedy for those patients who suffer from this disease and who will either be suffering an early untimely heart attack or stroke. The price we came to market with was clearly aligned with an understanding about the rebate that would be required in the marketplace to gain a competitive position. When you look at the data we presented at the ACC in March this year, we clearly talked about the pharmaco-economic value of this product, how PCSK9 within the class, and reconfirmed that our net price to payers is presently very much in the range of a pharmaco-economic price. We continue to believe that this drug brings value. When you look at the second year data, that you're reducing heart attacks by 35%, reducing stroke by 24%, 27%. It's an enormous crack in this disease that takes lives on a untimely basis. So we will continue to drive it forward, and to ensure that the value we bring is distinct and beneficial in the marketplace. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: And with the IL-1 beta data from the Novartis trial, I think we just have to wait to see the data to understand, but I don't expect that to have a direct impact on lipid-lowering approaches. Arvind Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Skinner? Operator : And our next question comes from Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have one on biosimilars. So you guys have 10 now in development I believe and you've seen success with the first three, HUMIRA, Herceptin and Avastin. Can you just remind us what is your situation with manufacturing capacity? Do you have capacity for all of these? Or will you need to expand and what's the path that if you'd have to go outside and use a CMO or would you build it yourself? Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Salim, we're in good shape with respect to our biosimilars. And one of the reasons we committed to this as a growth opportunity for the company was our belief that we do large-scale manufacturing of proteins very well. So we're deploying our process, development and manufacturing skills and we're in good shape for our programs. Operator : Our next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for Sean. Maybe if you can talk about some of the earlier things in your oncology pipeline, and how you are developing IO and do you think you need some of the more traditional assets like PD-1 or any of the other ones, OX40, that people are going after? Thanks. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yes. I mean I think right now we're very interested in our BiTE platform. We've made a strategic decision to focus primarily in biospecific T cell engaging, not ADCs, and we do have a limited but important effort, of course, in collaboration with Kite on CAR T cells. The BiTE platform is moving along quite significantly and because of the timing, if you think back to when we acquired the technology and how long it takes, we have a big wave of these molecules directed at hematologic and solid tumors moving into the clinic over the next 18 months or so. We have, of course, the half-life extension technology that we've added to the majority of these at this point. So that is very important. As you point out, there'll be the opportunity to combine them in many cases with checkpoint inhibition. From a R&D perspective, we've had no trouble at all getting partners to do these experiments with us, providing the PD-1 and often sharing the actual cost of the trials with us. So that's not been an issue. And then the other area we're still very excited about is T-Vec, particularly now as we begin to explore hepatic injection, different tumor types in combination with checkpoint inhibition. It opens up a range of tumor types to explore, including those that don't respond well to checkpoint inhibitors without a immunization strategy. And then last one I'd mention is our CSF-1 antibody is in combination right now with Merck's PD-1 and we're very excited about that program as well. So in terms of pure immuno-oncology, those would be the ones that I'd highlight. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: I think the big picture, Alethia, is that we see a lot of excess capacity, as I think it's two dozen, maybe even 25 different PD-1, PD-L1s that are competing now for space in oncology. So we're unlikely to jump in. We're watching the space carefully, but it looks to me like there's a lot of excess capacity right now in that area. Let's go to the next question Operator : Our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good evening, and thank you for squeezing me in. Just a question on the 340B program. When talking to folks at onco channel (1:05:58), they're talking about expanding their outpatient services out of disproportional share (1:06:02) hospitals. Could you just comment about how big this is for your business? What do you see the trend line? And what do you expect the impact would be of the CMS proposal to reduce the reimbursement rate? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Ronny, it's Tony. I don't have those exact numbers with me. We can get back to you, but obviously a lot of our oncology business is in the institution which falls under 340B and we watch that versus carefully. It has grown quite dramatically in the last three, four years or so, but I think it's sort of under 20% of our total business would be 340B. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Closer to 10% of the business, Ronny, and the trade associations, as you know, bio and pharma have been very focused on this, and I think it's a program that got launched with noble intentions, but it's one that's subject to some abuse. And so there's, as you know, some oversight focus in this area right now in Capitol Hill, including looking at whether the discounts are being appropriately applied to the patients that are most in need of them, et cetera. So I'd say stay tuned. This is an area that's likely to be evolving here over the coming legislative calendar. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo Securities LLC. Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. You've mentioned value-based pricing a few times with regards to the CGRP category and Repatha. Could you maybe talk about what you're hearing from payers in terms of how set up they are for that kind of model? And in migraine specifically, could you see some sort of contracts that are based on a certain level of migraine reduction? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So, Jim, the value-based process is defining the value of a product based on the threshold you set for a quality of life you saved. It's a process used by most health technology assessment companies around the world, such as the UK, Canada and Australia. It's an evolution of a process in the U.S. at the moment and we feel quite robust and confident in our ability to establish that type of range of value for a product. We discuss that with the payers on an ongoing basis. I think what you might be referring to is a bit of our risk-share contract we've actually put into place. And those are interesting ones too, where we have product deliver a distinctive value and we're prepared to put our money where our mouth is with those particular products. Some payers have taken us up, such as Harvard Pilgrim. Others are trying to work at how do they track that, monitor that as they go forward. But I would imagine going forward, it has to be something that becomes more and more popular. Arvind Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, Skinner, let's take two last questions after which Bob will make some concluding comments. Operator : Yes, sir. Our next-to-last question comes from Andrew Peters from Deutsche Bank. Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Quick one for me, just wanted to see if you've seen an inflection in the rate of Repatha rejections or approvals since FOURIER. And do you think that's really the biggest driver of kind of the share increases that you've seen against alirocumab or is it something else that you see in the market? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: If you turn to page 23 of your slide deck, that's of course a chart that I look at often, which shows a distinctive movement of our market share since the outcomes data was delivered at the ACC in March. Clearly people understanding the value of this drug in terms of long-term treatment. So we have in the interim also worked hard as I said earlier to try and reduce the impact on patients who have large commercial co-pays or large commercial deductions. And we're working consistently with payers to try and make the utilization management criteria as well as the process to get access to drug more reasonable to ensure appropriate patients get access. Operator : And our final question comes from Carter Gould from UBS Equities. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. For Tony, maybe just taking a different direction, can you help frame for us the magnitude of the incremental commercial opportunity for moving XGEVA into myeloma? And any nuances we should keep in mind in looking at peak penetration in the U.S. first year? Thank you. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: You guys can see the size of the multiple myeloma market based on the patient numbers themselves. So there's a distinctive population that exists over there. It's a population that presently isn't in our label and therefore we have not been able to promote on that particular patient group. And we look forward to doing it early in or whenever we get in a label in 2018. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: February PDUFA date and, Sean, you might just want to remind Andrew and others of the benefits we believe that XGEVA will provide those patients with multiple myeloma. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yes. I mean, as you probably are aware, virtually all myeloma patients, because of the secreted protein that characterizes the disease filters into the kidney, have varying degrees of renal insufficiency and have to have dose reductions or simply can't tolerate drugs like zoledronic acids. So there is an obvious need for a product that doesn't have renal clearance such as denosumab. However, in our original applications with denosumab, we had a subgroup of patients in one of the trials of multiple myeloma where it appeared as though there could be a harm signal on overall survival. It was a subgroup analysis that was unlikely to be real. We've of course demonstrated it wasn't real by doing this large trial that we've filed. And once we have the indication and can promote it and so on, I think the utilization that's been hampered by that concern about impact on the actual disease process will be alleviated and it should be a great advance for patients with multiple myeloma to have more access to denosumab. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Carter, thanks for that question. Thank you all for joining the call. I also want to thank our worldwide staff who are busy successfully executing on our strategy and operating the business right now really effectively while both delivering for patients and shareholders. So I hope you can see from our results that we're positioned for the changing competitive environment with the benefit of a new product cycle set to drive volume growth and a strong balance sheet that we intend to deploy to create value for our shareholders. We see both of these as key to sustaining long-term growth with Amgen. So thanks very much for joining us. We look forward to talking to you after the third quarter. Arvind Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks, everybody. We appreciate your participation and look forward to connecting both off line and after hours. Thanks again.

Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC Operator : My name is Ian, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Third Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Ian. Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for calling in to review and discuss our business performance for the third quarter. Consistent with the tradition that we have now established, I would like to acknowledge those who are new in their coverage or have changed firms recently, including Chris Raymond, who recently joined Piper Jaffray; Laura Chico of Raymond James and Kennen Mackay of RBC. Each of us are very much looking forward to working with you. Turning to our quarterly performance and keeping with the theme that we articulated at the beginning of the year of growing volumes, our growth products are all benefiting from solid unit volume growth, which is a key component of our long-term growth strategy of effectively transitioning from mature products to the more recently launched products. To discuss this, together with other topics, our Chairman and CEO Bob Bradway will lead the call today, followed by our CFO David Meline, who will review our financial results for the third quarter and our revised and tightened outlook for the remainder of 2017. Our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will review our product performance during the quarter, followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. In addition to posting slides that we plan to use for presentation today on our website, we have also posted an updated statement on progress we're making with our manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico following the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful in understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results, and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release, and also on the Investor Relations section of our website. Just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements, and our 2017 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Arvind. Our operating results through the first nine months of the year highlight that we are effectively managing our business during a period of transition as our recently launched products begin to gain traction around the world. Based on our ability to effectively manage costs, we've been able to raise our earnings outlook for the full year 2017, even while absorbing the costs of Hurricane Maria and continuing to direct investments towards long-term growth. As I've said before, growing volumes will be key to driving future revenue growth. Our growth brands, including Prolia, Repatha, KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO are all exhibiting solid unit volume growth. I'd like to highlight Prolia in particular. Prolia is a unique asset in the bone health area and has an extremely strong value proposition. As you can see in our results, it continues to generate strong volume growth. Osteoporosis remains an under-diagnosed and under-treated disease with serious consequences and we will continue to educate physicians and patients on the established clinical profile of Prolia and the obvious benefits of preventing fractures. I remain optimistic that Repatha will become a significant product for Amgen as it also brings a compelling value proposition to patients. Repatha's cardiovascular outcomes data are under priority review by the FDA, as you're aware, and this underscores the significant unmet medical need in cardiovascular disease. These data have already been incorporated by global professional societies into treatment guidelines and pathways, including the recent update from the American College of Cardiology. As I've said before, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death around the world and it's a disease that costs over $600 billion a year in the U.S. alone. Improving patient access to Repatha remains a top priority for our team. Looking ahead to next year, we expect to begin tackling another significant unmet medical need in migraine. We're pleased to be pioneering the new CGRP class of medicines. We continue to receive positive feedback on Aimovig and patients and physicians are excited by the prospects of a new, safe and effective preventative therapy. And that's exactly what we expect to deliver with Aimovig. Given our core capabilities in biologics, I think biosimilars will become an important growth driver for us as we continue to make progress in this area. As has become increasingly apparent, achieving biosimilarity is challenging, and our expertise in biologics development and manufacturing is a clear differentiator. This quarter, we received our second biosimilar approval with MVASI, a biosimilar to Avastin. We've also submitted our biosimilar to Herceptin to regulators for review. And importantly, we gained clarity around the launch timelines for AMGEVITA, our HUMIRA biosimilar, including an opportunity to launch in Europe starting next year. We expect our biosimilars business to be an attractive source of revenue growth for us and one from which we expect to earn a strong return on investment for our shareholders. We're taking steps to develop our pipeline to sustain long-term growth. In addition to pursuing Phase 3 trials for omecamtiv mecarbil in heart failure, and of course CNP520 for Alzheimer's disease, we're excited about moving Tezepelumab into Phase 3 for asthma. We have a leading position in the TSLP area and we're excited about the prospects of treating a broader population of asthmatics than other biologics on the market or in development. Sean will address this in more detail shortly. Let me just say a few words about our manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico following the recent direct hit of Hurricane Maria on the island. Amgen has more than 2,000 staff members in Puerto Rico and I'm delighted to report that all of our staff are accounted for and nearly all of our staff are now back at work. In fact, just five weeks after experiencing what was a 100-year storm, we have substantially resumed operations, serving patients in Puerto Rico and around the world. While we did experience some damage in Puerto Rico, generally speaking, our facilities weathered the storm well and are in relatively good shape. As we've said before, we expect no impact to product supply for patients around the world, a real tribute to our team on the island and to all those at Amgen who've been working together to help us manage through these challenging circumstances. We appreciate the FDA's focus on Puerto Rico while the island recovers, and we've also been reaching out to many other pharmaceutical and medical device companies on the island to see if there are things that we can do collectively to help Puerto Rico get back on its feet as quickly as possible. We will continue to provide updates on this situation as appropriate. Before I turn to David, let me just say that all-in-all, we feel we're in a strong position. We feel that we've positioned the company for the moment that we find ourselves in, as reflected in a balance sheet which is very strong, as reflected in the cash flows that you see in our business and as reflected in our ongoing tight control of expenses. As we look to the future, we feel we have improved clarity on our opportunities for 2018 and beyond, with the inclusion obviously of Repatha outcomes data in our label, which we think is set to happen in a matter of weeks; the prospect, as I've already mentioned, of launching our first-in-class migraine therapy Aimovig; clarity around prospective launch of Parsabiv in the U.S. for patients with kidney disease; two new opportunities for our denosumab franchise including for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis for Prolia and for multiple myeloma for XGEVA. We're also encouraged to have clarity now around our biosimilar franchise with, as I said a moment ago, a clear path for launching AMGEVITA internationally in 2018. And finally, following on our great success with Onpro for Neulasta, we're excited to be introducing our new AutoTouch injector for Enbrel as well. With that, let me turn to David. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Bob. We are pleased with our solid overall results and earnings growth in the third quarter as our transformation efforts continued to enable investment in our core business, while also delivering operating leverage in a period of portfolio transition. I also want to take a moment to provide an update from a financial perspective on our Hurricane Maria recovery efforts at our Puerto Rican manufacturing facilities. First off, I want to recognize the staff for their tireless efforts which have ensured our patients a stable supply of Amgen's medicines even in the face of devastating personal loss and disruption across the island. As Bob mentioned, while we did experience some damage, all things considered, we weathered the storm in relatively good shape. Consistent with our approach to all other aspects of our business, we hold ourselves accountable for managing a disciplined and effective recovery effort. We incurred $67 million of pre-tax expenses, or $0.07 a share in non-GAAP earnings in the third quarter related to inventory, idle facilities, repairs and support for our Puerto Rican staff. In the fourth quarter, the company expects our manufacturing facility recovery effort to drive pre-tax expenses in the range of $75 million to $100 million or $0.08 to $0.11 a share. At this time, we do not expect the recovery to have a significant impact on our full-year 2018 results. We will provide further detail when we share our 2018 guidance in January. We're working with our insurance providers but these estimates do not yet include insurance recoveries. Turning to the financial results on page 6 of the slide deck. Worldwide revenues at $5.8 billion in the third quarter are flat year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and are 1% lower on a reported basis including FX. This quarter we saw worldwide product sales at $5.5 billion, also flat year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and 1% lower on a reported basis including FX. Strong unit demand growth for our newer products was offset by declines in our mature brands. Other revenues at $320 million grew 8% versus the third quarter of 2016, driven by higher IBRANCE royalty revenue. Non-GAAP operating income at $3 billion grew 4% from the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by 2.7 points to 55.6% for the quarter, reflecting continued favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories and the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment. As in prior years, our operating margin is expected to be lower in the fourth quarter of the year, driven by the timing of expenses with the compare this year being especially challenged due to the $75 million to $100 million of incremental charges related to our hurricane recovery efforts. We will also pass the one year mark since the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment at the end of October. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased by 0.5 points to 13.5%, driven primarily by the impact of Hurricane Maria on our Puerto Rican operations, offset partially by manufacturing efficiencies and reduced royalties. Research and development expenses at $858 million were down 11% year-over-year, driven by several upfront payments for in-licensing transactions in Q3 of 2016, lower spending required to support certain later stage clinical programs, and continued benefits from transformation initiatives and process improvement efforts. SG&A expenses decreased 6% on a year-over-year basis due to the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment, partially offset by increased investments in product launches. In aggregate, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 5% year-over-year, reflecting additional transformation savings, while investing to build the business globally, support new product launches and investing in the long-term pipeline for the business. Other income and expenses were a net $58 million expense in Q3. This is favorable by $51 million on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by higher cash balances and gains from our venture investment portfolio. The non-GAAP tax rate was 19.4% for the quarter, a 0.5 point increase versus the third quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to adjustments to certain federal tax credits and deductions, offset partially by favorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings. Non-GAAP net income increased 5% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 8% year-over-year for the third quarter to $3.27 per share. Turning next to cash flow on the balance sheet on page 7. Free cash flow was $3.3 billion for the quarter compared to free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the third quarter of 2016, driven by improved collections and lower cash expenditures. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders, consistent with our commitments as we deployed $0.8 billion to repurchase 4.4 million shares at an average of $177 per share and are on track to achieve our total share repurchases for this year in the range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. Additionally, our third quarter dividend of $1.15 per share is an increase of 15% over last year. This reflects our balanced approach to capital allocation with significant investment in innovation in support of the long-term growth of the business as well as return of cash to shareholders. We continue to maintain financial and strategic flexibility as a result of our strengthening balance sheet position. Cash and investments totaled 41.4 billion, an increase of 3.4 billion from the third quarter of last year. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow generation. Our debt balance stands at $35.8 billion as of September 30, carrying a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and leverage maturity of 12 years. Turning to the outlook for the business for the remainder of 2017 on page 8. Overall, our revised 2017 guidance range for revenue is $22.7 billion to $23 billion versus previous guidance of $22.5 billion to $23 billion. With regard to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we are raising and narrowing the outlook to $12.50 to $12.70 per share. Our improved 2017 guidance reflects our continued conviction in our strategy as well as business performance over the first three quarters of the year. As a reminder, we expect to see an increase in operating expenses in Q4 versus Q3, reflecting the typical pattern for the business. Also included in this guidance is an incremental $75 million to $100 million of expenses related to Hurricane Maria recovery in the fourth quarter. Further, we are revising our non-GAAP tax guidance to 18% to 19% versus prior guidance of 18.5% to 19.5%. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year. In summary, our 2017 performance remains on track as we continue to invest to grow the business while transforming to a more efficient operating model. We will provide 2018 guidance on our January call. This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Thank you, David, and good afternoon folks. You'll find the details of revenue starting on slide number 10 of your deck. Strong and continued volume growth by Prolia and our more recently launched brands like Repatha, KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO helped offset declines in our mature brands. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, sales growth was flat year-over-year as reported sales declined 1%. The U.S. declined 2% year-over-year, and sales outside the U.S. grew 5%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven by a robust 8% volume growth. Let me start with Prolia. Prolia continues to deliver exceptional performance after being on the market for over seven years. Prolia grew 22% year-over-year with double digit volume growth in all markets, primarily from share gains. Quarter-on-quarter, we saw a slight decline, which follows the typical pattern for Prolia in the first and the third quarters. Prolia, as Bob said, is a unique asset with a very strong value proposition. There remains a large underserved osteoporotic population at risk for fracture. These fractures often cause loss of independence for patients and place a large burden on caregivers and society. We remain focused on improving diagnosis and treatment rates in order to bring Prolia to more of these patients in need. With share around 20% in most markets, there continues to be a lot of room for Prolia to grow and we are investing accordingly. As I mentioned before, there are some countries such as Australia, Switzerland and Ireland with better diagnosis and treatment rates for osteoporosis where Prolia has a 50% share or better. These are countries that truly understand the societal costs of nonintervention. KYPROLIS grew 13% year-over-year in a competitive multiple myeloma segment with several new entrants. Outside the U.S., we continue to see strong growth from both existing and new markets. KYPROLIS is a unique product in a competitive position having two compelling sets of overall survival data in relapsed multiple myeloma patients. Our most recent market share data in the U.S. shows an improvement in new patient share in second line setting. This is an important leading indicator for sales growth into future quarters. KYPROLIS also continues to have a prominent position in the NCCN Guidelines for all lines of therapy. XGEVA declined 2% year-over-year, primarily due to a shift in timing of purchases from some larger end customers. We believe XGEVA's positioned for growth in 2018 with the addition of a multiple myeloma indication. Neulasta declined 6% year-over-year due to a shift in timing of purchases by some larger end customers as well as a small decline in the number of myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens. The Onpro kit grew share to 56% of Neulasta units and we expect to continue to drive additional Onpro adoption into 2018. Our most recent in-market data shows that Onpro drives better adherence to therapy, which leads to lowering of rates of febrile neutropenia, and in fact lower rates of hospitalization. Simply put, Onpro is a better value to the healthcare system and this is an important point of potential differentiation for the future. With NEUPOGEN, the impact of short-acting biosimilar competition was consistent with prior trends. We exited the quarter with 41% share of the short-acting segment and we have continued to maintain pricing discipline despite the competitive pressures NEUPOGEN has faced over the last several years. Enbrel sales declined 6% year-over-year, in line with prescription trends. We expect these prescription trends to continue into 2018. Segment growth year-over-year was in line with last quarter across both rheumatology and dermatology segments, confirming the rebound from the slower growth seen in quarter one. Enbrel lost less than 1 point of share in both segments in this quarter, consistent with prior trends. Quarter three saw a low single digit year-over-year decline in net selling price. Overall, we expect there to be a very slight year-over-year decline in net selling price for the full year 2017. Most formulary decisions for 2018 have now been finalized and we expect the net selling price trends of 2017 to continue into 2018. You may recall that we noticed some potential excess end-user inventory at the end of quarter two. End-user inventory levels are estimated by deducting the value of prescriptions from the value of wholesaler shipments to end customers. Based on this data, we did not see a depletion in the third quarter. And if prior fourth quarter patterns hold, we would not expect a depletion in the fourth quarter either. We continue to make investments to maximize Enbrel's long-term value such as the imminent launch of our Enbrel AutoTouch, a reusable auto injector that is ergonomically designed to meet the needs of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Lastly, we look forward to extending our information franchise into Europe next year with the launch of AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to HUMIRA. Aranesp saw modest declines of 3% year-over-year. We had a small unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and unit volume declined slightly globally. EPOGEN declined 21% year-over-year. The primary driver was lower net selling prices, in line with quarter one and quarter two as a result of our extended DaVita agreement. In the third quarter, we did not see any underlying changes in the EPOGEN business, did have some unfavorable inventory changes which added to the year-over-year decline. Sensipar increased 10% year-over-year, primarily due to net selling price. We've now launched Parsabiv in over 10 countries in Europe and our partner ONO has had a very successful launch in Japan. We're preparing to launch in the U.S. when CMS reimbursement code for Parsabiv becomes effective on January 1, 2018. Now to Repatha. Our cardiovascular team continued its strong competitive execution, reaching 60% of total prescription share in the U.S. and 57% in the EU. In the U.S., new to brand share, which in my mind is a forecast of future sales, in the U.S. reached 74%. Sequentially, our Rxs grew by 20% in the U.S., however, sequential sales growth was tempered by changes in inventory and accounting adjustments that benefited the second quarter. We continue to work hard with payers to improve access for appropriate patients. And we look forward to the FDA's priority review of Repatha's cardiovascular outcomes data, which will allow us to start promoting Repatha's ability to reduce heart attacks and strokes with both physicians and patients in December this year. Cardiovascular disease continues to be the number one cause of death and disability in the world and it's a top priority of Amgen to ensure that appropriate patients have access to Repatha. So in conclusion, we are focused on a strong finish to 2017. As we prepare for numerous launches in 2018, which include our Repatha outcomes label, the Enbrel AutoTouch device, Aimovig for migraine, Parsabiv, the XGEVA multiple myeloma indication, as well as large opportunities from our biosimilar franchise. Let me for a moment stop and say thank you to all the Amgen staff, who have worked so hard and tirelessly this quarter to get our important drugs to patients around the world. And now let me pass you to Sean. Sean? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. I'll begin with our cardiovascular therapeutic area. On Repatha, we continue to work with regulators towards incorporating cardiovascular outcomes data on our label and we are looking forward to our PDUFA date of December 2. In September, the American College of Cardiology issued their updated expert consensus decision pathway for non-statin therapies based largely on our cardiovascular outcomes data. It's clear that if these recommendations were followed in the United States, millions of patients would be treated with PCSK9 inhibitors. We also recently completed a Phase 3 Repatha LDL lowering study in diabetic patients, an important population at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Repatha demonstrated efficacy and safety data consistent with that seen in our broader Repatha program and we'll be presenting the results at an upcoming medical meeting. After reviewing the recently presented outcomes data from Merck's CETP inhibitor, anacetrapib, we feel the value of our CETP inhibitor, AMG 899, would be best realized through potential out-licensing opportunities, which we are exploring. I'd also like to provide an update on one of our exciting Phase 1 cardiovascular programs, AMG 986. AMG 986 is a small molecule agonist of the apelin APJ receptor, which is associated with the body's biologic stress response to heart failure. Consistent with our strategy to pursue novel targets with human validation, administration of an endogenous peptide agonist of APJ has been shown to improve cardiac function in heart failure patients. Preclinical data support clinical testing in the setting of heart failure with both preserved and reduced ejection fraction. We're actively enrolling healthy volunteers and heart failure patients in Phase 1 and appear to be in a significant leading position around this exciting axis. Turning to inflammation and our TSLP antibody Tezepelumab, which we're developing in collaboration with AstraZeneca, the results of a large Phase 2b study in patients with uncontrolled asthma were recently published and presented to a very enthusiastic response. TSLP is an upstream epithelial driver of inflammation in asthma and the data supported the potential to address a broader population of patients, essentially all comers, then targeting individual cytokines such as IL-413 or IL-5. We're currently working with our partner and regulators on the design of our Phase 3 asthma program and we'll provide updates as we progress. Finally, results from a small exploratory short duration Phase 2a study of Tezepelumab as an add-on treatment to medium and high strength topical glucocorticoids in atopic dermatitis were recently posted. 111 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis received 280 milligrams of Tezepelumab or placebo every other week for 12 weeks. Statistical significance on the primary endpoint of 50% reduction in eczema area and severity index at 12 weeks was not achieved, though positive trends were observed across a number of disease activity endpoints, suggesting that Tezepelumab may deliver clinical benefit as add-on treatment to topical glucocorticoids. The evaluation of Tezepelumab in atopic dermatitis may require further study and we continue to consider this indication among others in our lifecycle development plan. I'll begin my comments on our oncology efforts with KYPROLIS. In the second-line, a relapsed multiple myeloma setting, we now have an April 2018 PDUFA date for the ENDEAVOR overall survival data, and we're busy preparing a submission for the ASPIRE overall survival data. In the frontline, or newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, we're supporting high-quality evidence generation through randomized Amgen-supported studies, sponsored by investigators and large cooperative groups with a focus on the KRd regimen, KYPROLIS, Revlimid and dexamethasone. We're particularly interested and excited about the potential of KYPROLIS plus DARZALEX and will begin to support KRd plus DARZALEX study along with Janssen in the frontline transplant-eligible population to build on the ongoing KD plus DARZALEX study we're running with Janssen in the relapsed or refractory setting. We believe the combination of these two highly potent therapies could significantly improve patient outcomes and drive patients into deep, durable remissions. Lastly, on KYPROLIS, the Phase 3 A.R.R.O.W. study of KYPROLIS administered at 70 milligrams per meter squared weekly versus 27 milligrams per meters squared twice weekly in combination with dexamethasone met its progression-free survival primary endpoint at a pre-specified 75% interim analysis by demonstrating superior efficacy of the 70-milligram weekly regimen with similar safety findings. Turning to our bispecific T cell engager programs, we recently announced the collaboration with CytomX to expand our immuno-oncology capabilities with an additional and complementary bispecific technology. As part of the agreement, we will co-develop a T cell engaging bispecific antibody against epithelial growth factor receptor, or EGFR, employing their Probody technology. And we've also have exclusive rights to develop up to three additional undisclosed targets. In our BiTE platform, we have several extended half-life BiTEs moving into Phase 1 : AMG 673, directed against CD33 for AML, AMG 596 against EGFR Variant III for glioblastoma and AMG 701 against BCMA for multiple myeloma. Importantly, we have also seen data recently that markedly increased our confidence that BiTEs can have impressive activity in solid tumors. Turning to IMLYGIC, our oncolytic viral therapy, in collaboration with Toni Ribas at UCLA, we recently published positive clinical and impressive biomarker data from a Phase 1b melanoma study of IMLYGIC in combination with Keytruda, a checkpoint inhibitor. To the best of our knowledge, these were the first clinical data published in the journal Cell, and generated much enthusiasm among clinical investigators. These results, along with our other Phase 2 data, of both biomarker and clinical endpoints in combination with the belimumab, add to the growing body of evidence supporting the systemic effect of IMLYGIC and its considerable potential for combination with checkpoint inhibitors. A word on Aranesp, after many years of intense effort, our final post-marketing requirement study on tumor progression and overall survival has read out. This was a prospective 2,500 patient double-blind placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Aranesp in anemic populations with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, receiving multi-cycle chemotherapy. Recall that this was one of the tumor types that had suggested potential tumor progression effects in a small study. The data monitoring committee determined that the primary endpoint would be met with near certainty and recommended that we stop the study early. After discussion with global regulators, we ended the study and the data indeed showed that the primary endpoint of non-inferiority of Aranesp to placebo in overall survival was successfully achieved as were the secondary endpoints of non-inferiority to progression-free survival and non-inferiority to objective tumor response. As expected, transfusions were lower in the Aranesp arm. In bone health, our Prolia submission for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is under review with a May 2018 PDUFA action date. Results of the Phase 3 ARCH study with romosozumab, or EVENITY, compared to alendronate in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were recently published and presented. We continue to believe from our interactions with experts in the field and regulators that there may be a patient population at high risk for fractures for whom EVENITY could provide a positive benefit risk and we're evaluating all of our Phase 3 clinical trial data to gain a comprehensive understanding of the cardiovascular safety results that were observed in ARCH, yet not observed in our placebo-controlled FRAME study. In our neuroscience collaboration with Novartis, we recently presented the results from a unique dedicated study that demonstrated that Aimovig did not aggravate ischemia in patients with stable angina, contributing further to the growing body of evidence supporting the safety profile of CGRP receptor inhibition with Aimovig. In our second migraine program, I am pleased to report we're currently enrolling migraine patients now in a Phase 2b study of our PAC1 antibody AMG 301. PAC1 inhibition is a novel approach to migraine prevention that is mechanistically differentiated from the CGRP pathway. And finally, I'd like to highlight our second U.S. biosimilar approval, in this case, for all eligible indications of Avastin, and the U.S. submission of ABP 980, our biosimilar Herceptin. Achieving biosimilarity in the U.S. regulatory environment has turned out to be more challenging than many expected and our continued success is a testament to our unsurpassed biologics development and manufacturing capabilities. As always, I'd like to thank all of the staff at Amgen that make it possible to wage war against the worst forms of disease. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay, thank you, Sean. Ian, can we open up the lines for questions now and would you remind our callers of the process? Operator : Our first question is from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray. Christopher Raymond - Piper Jaffray : Hey, thanks. Thanks for taking the question. So just a question on the Neulasta Onpro Kit, if you don't mind, I'm noticing that quarter-on-quarter share ticked up about 1%, it looks like, to 56%. I think that's a little bit of a leveling off from what you've seen in previous quarters. Just wondering if you could maybe comment on what you think a steady-state share would be for that presentation of the product ahead of any biosimilar Neulasta launch? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So, Chris, this is Tony. Clearly, I'm not happy with 56%. If I look at the product value that this thing brings in terms of enhancing patients' ability to go home, the value to a large institution in terms of how they treat patients, we will continue to drive hard to increase that share beyond 56%. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you very much and congratulations on the solid results. A question for David. Look, you highlighted the operating margin uptick in the quarter and then the potential step down in Q4. But as you look ahead, you must have gone through your sort of long-range planning exercise, David. How do things look in terms of your ability to maintain those operating margin as you change the mix of products and pivot over to partnerships and collaborations? Is this 55% looking sustainable to you, or should we be anticipating that there will be some reduction over the next few years? David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Sure. So yeah, so if you recall, we set out a plan for the company a few years ago to get to 52% to 54% objective by 2018. And the good news for the company is we've been able to certainly move that forward and achieve that type of performance upwards to a year in advance of our original goal. So we've been quite pleased with our ability to deliver on that performance. And I think importantly during the period, while we were accomplishing that, we've had record levels of investment in R&D. We've stood up a cardiovascular franchise. We're about to stand up a neuro franchise here next year, built the biosimilars business and increased our footprint from 50 to 100 countries. So if I look at that performance and I look at our ability to continue to invest, I think it's quite encouraging. And while we haven't given guidance post 2018 yet, I think suffice to say we feel very good about the sustainability of that type of margin performance for the company. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. It's two parter for me on Repatha. I guess, maybe could you comment on what your view is on the market share for that product going forward? Obviously, you pointed to NBRxs that are quite high, though your competitor products obviously may remain on the market longer than you originally thought. And then any comments on how formularies for Repatha are shaping up into 2018? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Okay, Matt, so Tony, let me respond there. So, the market share we've achieved to date has been in the presence of a competitor. So as I think about going forward, we will continue to be competitive. And I think getting more and more patients on Repatha is our objective, which we've been quite successful with. We are working extensively with payers at the moment in terms of improving potentially the utilization management criteria and working on trying to reduce the onerous bureaucracy that takes place and frustrates physicians at the moment. We look forward to being able to pull some of these things through potentially in 2018. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering, Bob, if you could just give us your view on tax reform as we head into 2018? I know there's a lot of moving pieces there, but do you anticipate that Puerto Rico would still be advantaged relative to the U.S.? And then on the capital allocation front, how do you think about the potential for use of capital if there is a repatriation allowed under the deal? Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Sure, Terence, thanks for the question. Obviously, we think tax reform makes sense for the country. We've been advocating for that for some time. We continue to advocate for it and continue to advocate for the need for that tax reform to reflect the reality in Puerto Rico which is that a number of organizations, including Amgen, have major investments in Puerto Rico that were made there to capitalize on the tax advantages created by U.S. laws. So we're keen to see that as tax reforms plays out, the important role of manufacturing in the island is reflected and that the appropriate language is included in the tax reform to continue to maintain the incentive for us and others to invest on the island. So we're watching the process closely, Terence and interested as no doubt all of you are to see exactly how the language will be written to address the needs in Puerto Rico. And then more broadly on capital allocation, obviously we have a track record of returning significant capital to our shareholders and to the extent that tax reform happens and provides greater flexibility for us, we'll take that into account in our capital allocation plans. But as you know, from our track record over the last many years, we've been actively returning capital in the form of growing dividend and buyback and I'd expect us to continue that. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thank you. So, you tend to have had \u2013 one of the few people who have had a lot of success getting biosimilars approved and through. There's been a lot of other rejections or delays. And we have noted that NEUPOGEN really was impacted by biosimilars while Remicade was not. So I was just wondering if you could help us understand given what you seen in the biosimilar space, how to think about how you will launch your biosimilars. How do we think about the Remicade analogy and the NEUPOGEN analogy and how to model your biosimilar business? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay, Robyn, I'll ask Tony to comment on the specifics of how we're looking at going to market. But your general point is noted. It has proven difficult for our competitors to get biologics approved and biosimilars approved on time. And we're not fully surprised by that. We expected that there would be difficulties and we expected that the capabilities we had would be helpful for us to differentiate versus some of our competitors. And I think that's what's playing out. But I think the gist of your question about how we're planning to go to market is one for Tony to address. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. So, Robyn, clearly we think that the market in the beginning will be a branded biosimilar market. And therefore, the value we bring as an organization about the quality and the continuity of our supply is really important. The relationships we have with large institution, with small community clinics is really going to be important as well. So we will focus very clearly upon our relationships of the past, our skills of the past, as well as the value of the product we bring to market. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have one on Enbrel, maybe for Tony. So one, I'm curious on your comment that you do not expect further depletion of Enbrel inventory in Q4. And I was wondering why that could be. And then secondly, can you comment on 2018 net pricing trend for Enbrel now that we're kind of like late 2017 already? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Ying, so as I've said, the end-user inventory is a triangulation we do in an attempt to give you guys as much visibility as possible about what we know to allow you to run your models. But fundamentally, we do the calculation based on what the Rxs are in the marketplace, which I'm never 100%, minus what we know our wholesaler have sold to the end users and the balance we assume is an inventory build. When I look back five years, I've never seen an inventory burn in the fourth quarter, so we're making the assumption that there wouldn't be an inventory burn this fourth quarter as well. As regards to 2018, as I said in my earlier comments, most of our contracts have been negotiated, although that doesn't mean that there won't be negotiations that continue going forward during 2018, but we do expect the net selling price for Enbrel, the trend you've seen in 2017, we expect that to continue to 2018. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company. Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Co. LLC: Thanks for taking my question. It's on Sensipar and Parsabiv. I guess first, are we expecting generic Sensipars in March of next year, or were you able to extend pediatric exclusivity I think is what you were looking for another six months? And second, can Tony talk a little bit about the switching strategy to Parsabiv starting January 1? Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, so let me just take your question on Sensipar, and then Tony, you talk about Parsabiv. We have litigation, as you know, Eric, underway, regarding the pediatric extension, so I don't want to comment on that while the litigation is pending. But Tony, why don't you talk about Parsabiv. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So we are bringing Parsabiv to market based on the clinical data we have at present, right. So by definition, secondary HPT is a very difficult thing to treat and adherence is a real problem. I think we have about 150,000 patients on the drug at the moment which is only about a 26% penetration. The head-to-head data we have shown great levels of efficacy of Parsabiv and without doubt in our mind, we will see a better level of adherence as physicians are back in control. All feedback we have had to date from nephrologists in the marketplace has been very good. They are looking forward to having this drug available. So whether it's a switch or replacement or usage during a treatment period will be dependent upon the physician or the dialysis unit in terms of their guidelines. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC : Hi guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I actually had a strategy question today, if I may. And I'm curious, has there been any consideration or deliberation internally on possibly extending the Novartis partnership to include the CV franchise also? And I'm just thinking out loud about Novartis' increased presence in cardiology with ENTRESTO as well as their new CANTOS data. I wasn't sure if this something that has been dealt with previously, and/or how you'd think about pushes and pulls on a possible setup like this? I mean it doesn't have to be necessarily a 50/50, but just perhaps thinking about margins and taking advantage of their presence now. Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: With respect to our partnership with Novartis, we're very happy with how we're collaborating with each other. And neuroscience, as you know, we were really attracted to their BACE program because we liked the clinical experiment that's being run there. We believe strongly in BACE and we believe that the appropriate way to test it is by getting to patients early, and together that's what we're doing. And they liked our CGRP program and our commitment to migraine, so that we think we have a good partnership there. We have pioneered a lot of new ground in the cardiovascular space and we're excited about our intellectual property there, excited about what we see in the pipeline and so we're content to continue to own all of that franchise certainly in atherosclerosis. And as you know, we have partnerships already in heart failure. So we're generally optimistic and upbeat about what we see happening in cardiovascular. And as David said, we've fully invested in the standing up of that franchise. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC : Hey, great. Thanks for the question. I know that you're prepared to give I'm sure 2018 guidance in due time, but many years ago you gave longer-term guidance. As you think ahead over the next few years, which I think the Street remains uncertain about, what are the push and pulls that you think need to happen to be able to have visibility to provide that, or should we stay tuned? How do we think about that? Because that seems to be something I think that's weighing on people. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, Michael, as David said in his remarks, we would expect \u2013 we'd normally give guidance in January for 2018, so we'd expect to do that. As David also said in his remarks, we've made great progress on achieving the objectives that we established for 2018. In some areas, obviously we're moving more quickly to achieve those objectives than we had expected, so we're looking at the options to what makes sense when we get to providing the next batch of guidance and talking to our shareholders about that. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys, thanks a lot for the question. A real quick one. Sean, on the migraine program, maybe just can you go into a little bit more on 301, what you'd be looking for in a Phase 2 above and beyond what you see with erenumab? I'm just trying to think about kind of cost/benefit and risk/benefit? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for the question. I think initially, we have a form of human validation for this pathway and that if the ligand for this receptor is infused into migrainers, they experience migraine, and this is what was seen with CGRP as well. And we also have a pharmacodynamic assay that we look at in Phase 1, which is very similar to what we did with erenumab, where we know that we're covering the target and peripheral tissues. So the next step for this is to achieve clinical proof-of-concept for the pathway and in terms of the ability to prevent migraine and to understand the dose that's required for that. And then I believe that we need to begin to understand, since these are such different neural circuits in the brain, whether there is a situation in which we can see additive or synergistic activity between PAC1 inhibition and CGRP inhibition, where there are certain patients who respond to one but not the other, or whether we can get again a kind of a synergistic effect in patients who do already respond to CGRP inhibition. So I think that's all work that remains and we of course have the option to pursue that either through fixed dose type combinations, but we also have a bispecific program where we're actually able to inhibit both these targets in a single molecule. And that's all work that's going to be done, as we've mentioned, collaboratively here at Amgen but in collaboration with Novartis. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question, which is on erenumab as well, or Aimovig. I wanted to ask about the progress of your prelaunch activities, how they're going and the early reception you're seeing on the part of physicians and especially payers in terms of the level of enthusiasm for the class in general and this product in particular. And maybe how are the responsibilities towards these activities being divided by you and Novartis? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So this is Tony. Thanks, Cory. I just came back from the International Headache Conference (sic) [International Headache Congress], which was in Vancouver, where I was meeting with a group of key opinion leaders and individuals who run headache clinics together with me with my counterpart from Novartis, Paul Hudson. So he and I, we're working this together. So as we think strategically, the two organizations are doing a lot of strategic thinking together. We both jointly agree that we probably saw more enthusiasm from this set of neuro physicians than we've ever seen in many other physicians in other congresses. People are talking about this is the first time they are being able to potentially prescribe a migraine drug for migraine patients in two decades. So I came away feeling much more positive about the scientific understanding, the clinical need and the large population that is waiting for this. The work we've done at the moment with migraine bloggers and patients who are suffering from migraine has also been very beneficial. We understand much better now the patient's journey, the importance of the work we have to do with patients and their willingness to work with us to spread this good message once we have our drug approved. Obviously, we continue to work with payers in strategic discussions, but we haven't made any final decisions around pricing as we go forward. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Another one for you, Tony, on the migraine. I guess, can you maybe talk about parallel learnings from PCSK9 since they are kind of similarly big, and like how to think about the migraine market in light of what the payers could do and strategies you have there? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Sure, Alethia. So I think first of all, the magnitude of the market is different, right? In the U.S., we estimate about 3.5 million patients right now are being treated for prophylactic treatment of migraine. A lot of those patients fail. A lot of those patients go off treatment because of side effects. A lot of those patients find the treatment is not effective. I think we believe that we will clearly be positioned for patients who failed existing therapy. And last but not least, I think patients are much more aware of the disease. This is a symptomatic disease. When you have a migraine, you're very much aware of it. So I think patient mobilization in terms of their voice around the need to have access to drug is going to be important. The value these drugs bring to the marketplace too, when you think about how debilitating migraine really is in terms of stopping people from going to work, preventing people from being mothers or caregivers, there is huge value to society to allow these people to get back their independence and to become normal citizens again. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Ian, before you go to the next question, let me just note that we're getting up towards the top of the hour, but I gather there are a few questions still queued up, so just wanted to alert the listeners that we'll go a little longer than usual. Go ahead to the next question. Operator : Certainly. Our next question is from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good evening, and thank you for fitting me in. Two questions. First, CMS seems to be contemplating a single J-code for biosimilars innovative product. How do you guys feel about it? Would that help or help the biosimilar market? And second, one of your peers appears to be pushing up the pricing band for oncolytics. What is your take on this as the current investment in oncolytics justifies gradually raising the price band on those products? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. So two questions there, Ronny. I'm not sure we're going to want to talk about pricing. But with respect to J-codes, this is an important issue that we've been active in trying to help legislators understand. So Tony, go ahead. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Right. So we clearly believe that having a single J-code is not what you want, right? If you believe that a biosimilar has to be a decision made by a physician, you want clarity around each single product has to be able to reflect in the marketplace. So we're working hard to ensure that we have actual J-code by product as we go forward. On the pricing one, I'm not quite sure what the competition is doing and that's their decision. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: We launched our oncolytic antiviral product or viral therapy with a very, we think, compelling value proposition, as you perhaps recall, Ronny. So we were trying to help institutions and patients understand that we were willing to cap their exposure from a price perspective. And I think that's been well received in the marketplace. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Kennen Mackay from RBC Capital Markets. Kennen Mackay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks so much for taking our question. And, Arvind, thank you for the recognition of our initiation and, Bob, it's a huge relief to hear that your Puerto Rico staff is safe and accounted for here. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks, Kennen. Kennen Mackay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I actually had one quick question on Hurricane Maria. David, you'd mentioned the $67 million in one-time quarterly damage associated with the Hurricane was partially due to inventory. And was just curious if this was inventory lost in Puerto Rico. And had also been looking at the product slides Tony had in the slide deck, and it looks like there were inventory drawdowns across the board with the exception of Sensipar. Is that a function of hurricane disruption, or is that just sort of quarterly reflection there? Thank you. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Sure. So it is true, what happened as a result of the hurricane is we had some product that was in process that it turned out was contaminated and so we had to scrap that product. So that was the inventory impact which was a portion of the $67 million of cost for the company. In terms of other disruption within the context of Puerto Rico, we have ample inventory for such interruptions, and so it hasn't impacted obviously our ability to supply. And Tony will probably comment, but I think as to the second part of the question, that's your normal dynamics of the seasonality, right? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, I don't think any of the inventory movement had anything to do with the hurricane. Most of the discrepancies were as a result of contracts ending early and buying in that took place in the second quarter which would normally happen in the third quarter. There was sufficient inventory both in our supply chain here as well as in the wholesaler supply chain during this period. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Andrew Peters from Deutsche Bank. Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in. And I guess just another biosimilar one. So regarding the overall portfolio, while regulatory timelines appear relatively straightforward, I'm wondering if you can provide a little bit more context regarding potential launch timing. I know it's kind of on a case-by-case basis relative to I guess legal negotiations, et cetera. Just wanted to understand if you have any sense of where we are in the process for the various products and how you think about timing overall to coming to market? Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Well, Andrew, I guess the premise that it's relatively straightforward to develop these is one that people are struggling with in the industry. But as I said earlier, I think we expected that some of our competitors would struggle to achieve biosimilarity and we would observe that that's been playing out. So far we've been fortunate to be able to advance molecules that have passed the test with not just regulators here in the U.S., but globally, and we're committed to continue to try to do that. Obviously the first step along the journey is getting our products approved. We have now, as you know, two of them, AMGEVITA and MVASI, which is our biosimilar to Avastin. And we now have clarity around our launch plans for AMGEVITA and we're excited about that. We have ongoing litigation with respect to MVASI, so I think it's probably inappropriate to talk about that now. But generally, I think that since in the U.S. anyway, this pathway is still so new, there probably are still some regulatory paths to be made more clear. And I think certainly on the intellectual property front, there's still more work to be done in the field before we can all start to predict launch timetables accurately. So I'd like to resist trying to do that on this call, but I would remind you that we continue to be transparent about where our products are when they enter pivotal Phase 3 trials and when we file them with regulators and we'll continue to do that. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Yeah, hi guys. Congrats on the quarter. I had a question on Repatha. So we're getting the ODYSSEY outcomes data early 2018. And if we get the scenario here where the data looks optically better, right, because of the longer duration trial, but it still falls along the CTC (01:04:10) line, how do you guys view that? Is that a good because it grows the market you think, or a bad, because that's competitor data. I was just curious what your thoughts are there. Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Sounds like you're trying to draw us into a discussion of hypotheticals there, Salim. I think, Sean, if you feel you want to be drawn to that, fire away. But I hope you'll take a moment just to reiterate what we've learned about our products in the outcomes trial. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah well, I mean, my view would be that we've already seen with bococizumab, although they had their immunogenicity issues, which caused the molecule not to be able to be commercialized. We've already seen two PCSK9 inhibitors clearly fall along the CTCC (01:04:57) line. And so is it good for the science and for the field to have a third outcomes result? Sure, I mean, the reason there's so much confidence in statins, for example, is we have a couple dozen outcomes trials that all more or less show the same thing. And I think, so from a scientific perspective, I think it will reinforce a number of the issues. And so in that way, I look forward to seeing the additional data. Tony, obviously. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: I think if you were at the ESC recently when we presented some of the subcuts of the Repatha outcomes data and we looked at the cohort where you had patients who entered at LDLs below 70 and how as you drove LDL down to levels way below 70, you actually got a higher reduction in myocardial infarction and reduction in stroke, and our data alone showing up to about a 33% reduction in MI. I can't understand why you wouldn't want to do anything other than drive LDL down as low as you can. So our drug does that, other drugs don't. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital Markets. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on one of the earlier questions on Puerto Rico. Can you just give us a sense for your ability to continue to sort of manufacture in Puerto Rico? Is that based on resumption on some semblance of normalcy? And when would that need to occur? Or can you continue to manufacture based on sort of the contingency plans that you have in place? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, we have very robust contingency plans in place, Ian, and we're up and running. We're virtually all of our activities are up and running. We have astonishingly almost all of our 2,000 staff are back at work despite enormous disruptions in their personal lives. They're back at work making product for patients around the world. So we're, I must say, we're humbled and incredibly proud of what we've seen from our staff down there over the last five weeks. So we're up and running. We are dependent on our own sources of power right now and we're looking forward to the island getting the electrical grid restored. We're looking forward to the communications grid getting restored, looking forward to a reliable water supply. We think we're in pretty good shape there at the moment though and the roads. And gradually, things are getting back to normal for the families who work at companies like Amgen. But the good news is we're up and running. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah. No, that's right. As of this week, all of the plants that where we have demand requirements are fully ramped up and are producing. So, and that's very recently that's happened, but we don't see any, as I said earlier, we don't see any risk of disruption of supply. And I think importantly, we're back up and running and feel very good about that. And the one thing that's not as convenient is the fact we're running on our own power and we look forward to that being restored. But that's doesn't create any risk of our ability to produce. So yeah, so it's come out very well, I'd say. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Hey Ian, being sensitive to the fact that it's past 6 :00 PM on the East Coast, why don't we take two more questions. Operator : Certainly, sir. Our next question is from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo Securities. Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, hi guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I guess just a strategic question and given your focus on bispecific T-cell engagers in BLINCYTO, and given the acquisition of Kite by Gilead and your relationship with Kite as well, can you maybe speak to your interest in the cell therapy area to complement what you're doing with bispecifics? Thanks. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, good. Thanks for the question. I think we do have an interest in cell-based therapies and we're very happy that we have the collaboration with Kite, now Gilead, around the six targets that we set up in that original deal. And we're learning a lot there and we're progressing those programs. I think our perspective remains, as we've looked at the technologies that the bispecific T-cell engaging approach, both in hematologic malignancies and increasingly in solid tumors, particularly in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, is appearing to be a very powerful technology. And these are off-the-shelf products that can be administered virtually immediately to patients and may offer a benefit/risk profile that would allow them to be used in earlier lines of therapy than in the current benefit/risk profile for CAR-T therapies, for example, tends to limit them to later stages of situations where patients are rather deep into the relapsed and refractory phases of their disease. I also think that we have a significant opportunity here now that we have the sense from accumulating data in our own hands and seeing what's going on out in the rest of the industry of the opportunity for BiTEs to have activity in solid tumors. And so I think we have a very large number of programs that we are pushing through the pipeline right now against both hematologic and solid tumor products. I think cell-based therapies do have a role and that role will probably increase over time as some of the technology matures. And it may be possible to use them in earlier lines of therapy, as I mentioned. And we're tracking that closely. But right now, for the immediate kind of foreseeable three to five year period, we remain very enthusiastic about the bispecific T-cell engaging platform, particularly now with the half-life extended protein engineering. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Carter Gould from UBS Equities. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for squeezing me in guys, and congrats on the quarter. One for Sean, real quick. How should we think about AMG 986 development in the context of omecamtiv? Should it be perceived more as a backup or complementary? And if there's any sort of just natural patient segmentation that might follow from the mechanism for these two assets, that would be helpful. Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, it's a great question. I mean, this is really a completely different mechanism of action than myosin activation. And while they're both targeting patients with heart failure, that's kind of where the obvious similarities end. I would say that what's been particularly exciting with apelin is the fact that we're seeing not only enhanced contractility, so systolic effect, but we're actually seeing enhancement of cardiac relaxation or diastolic effect. And that is unique in our knowledge to this particular mechanism. So it allows us to consider pursuing add-on therapy presumably to standard-of-care in the reduced ejection fraction setting as we are doing with omecamtiv mecarbil in our experiment right now in Phase 3, which by the way, is enrolling extremely well. And, but also to explore the situation where there is absolutely no registered therapy available for the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction population, which is a very large population and is currently very underserved. So it's still reasonably early days in the clinic, Phase 1, but this is one of the more exciting programs we have in the cardiovascular arena. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay, well thank you, Sean. I think we probably should break now but let me just say a couple quick thoughts in conclusion. First, I hope you can see that we're executing on our strategy and that we've put the company in a strong position for dealing with the realities of the environment that exist in our industry today. I'm pleased with our efforts to drive growth products as well as with the lifecycle management of our mature brands. And I wanted just end by thanking our staff globally and particularly once more our colleagues in Puerto Rico for driving results and delivering for patients. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Bob. And I would like to thank all of you for your participation. Of course, if you have any follow-on questions, comments, that you would like to discuss, feel free to reach out to me and my team. We'll be around for several hours. Thanks again.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Okay. Thank you, Skinner. Good afternoon everybody. I would like to welcome you to our conference call to discuss our business performance for 2017 and our outlook for 2018. Although our results exemplify our focus on volume driven growth, tax reform has created profound changes and opportunities for our industry and our company. So to begin this dialogue, our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway will provide some perspective, followed by our CFO, David Meline who will review our Q4 and full year 2017 results and provide guidance for 2018. Our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will review our product and geographic performance in 2017, followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. As in the past, we will use slides corresponding to our presentation today and a link to these slides was sent earlier. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today\u2019s presentation to provide information, which maybe useful in understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today\u2019s press release, a Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website. Just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements and our 2017 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you for joining our call. We have more ground than usual to cover with you in our prepared remarks this afternoon. We will be addressing not only our results for 2017 and our outlook for this year, but also the impact of tax reform, which we see is a very favorable development for our business. To kick off, I would offer that with another year of strong performance behind us, we are even more excited about the long-term prospects for our business than we were a year ago. In 2017, we continued to deliver solid operating performance as earnings per share growing 8% and operating margins improving to an industry leading 53.5%. In capital terms, payout to our shareholders grew by 14% as we improved our return on capital to 33%. We delivered these results in a period of increased competition for many of our largest products, several of which have lost patent protection and while continuing to invest heavily in the future of our business. Our steady progress through 2017 places us squarely on track to deliver against the long-term commitments we set several years ago for 2018. We entered 2018 in a strong position and confident about our long-term outlook. Those franchises which have come off patent in nephrology and oncology had held up well and we expect them to remain competitive. The brands that we expect to drive our future growth led of course by Repatha, Prolia, and KYPROLIS, with Aimovig and the biosimilars coming close behind are emerging now and the strong data we have to support them are encouraging. And finally, we have stable cash flows and the strong balance sheet both of which are improved by tax reform. We intend to use our resources to continue to invest in our people and the attractive long-term growth opportunities we see in our industry, including M&A where it fits our focus while also returning capital to our shareholders. To be successful in the long run in our industry, we think it will be essential to have innovative, differentiated medicines that deliver large beneficial effects for patients suffering from serious illness and to demonstrate that these medicines provide value for all stakeholders in the healthcare system. We have a number of these medicines on the market now and in our pipeline, some of which meet the needs of large patient populations and some of which are for more specialized markets. With pressure on prices globally, we think revenue growth will be more tightly linked to volume growth and was the case historically. In this regard medicines that serve the needs of large numbers of patients will be particularly attractive growth drivers. Repatha is a clear example of this. On this call last year, we announced the successful conclusion of the Repatha outcomes trial. Now following an expedited review by the FDA, we are able to talk to patients, payers and prescribers about the unique role of Repatha in significantly reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke. Cardiovascular disease is the single greatest problem facing healthcare systems around the world today. And as the population ages globally, this problem will only grow unless we embrace important new innovations. Repatha is exactly the type of innovation needed today by millions of patients to bring down the risk of cardiovascular disease. Our job now is to see the prescribers, patients and payers understand this product and recognize the importance of adopting it for high risk patients. As they do, we expect Repatha to be the important growth driver for us for many years to come. We will continue to work to ensure that patients gain access to this therapy worldwide especially those for whom other therapies have not proven effective. Like Repatha, Prolia represented a paradigm change in biologic when it was first launched for osteoporosis. Today it is of course the leading osteoporosis therapy. In fact there are 3.5 million patients worldwide taking Prolia. And the demand for it continues to grow by double digit percentages. With only 25% of women in the U.S. who might benefit from osteoporosis therapy receiving it, we continue to see significant growth potential for Prolia in osteoporosis. In our pipeline, I will highlight two products which have similar attractive characteristics, but which address more symptomatic diseases. One of these is Aimovig and a first in class product to prevent migraine. Current therapies don\u2019t work adequately for this debilitating disease and patients and prescribers are anxious to have a better option. We are hopeful that Aimovig which uniquely blocks the CGRP receptor will be the answer that millions of patients have been waiting for. The other product I will highlight is Tezepelumab, a first in class molecule that has shown very encouraging Phase 2 results in treating asthma there. There are millions of asthma sufferers worldwide in need of better therapy. We are hopeful that Tezepelumab might be just that and we are actively enrolling the Phase 3 trial to establish the answer. We have enjoyed great success in specialty markets historically and with our innovative medicines and we expect that to continue. XGEVA represents a good example of this. And with the addition of multiple myeloma to our label, we would expect to see more growth from this product beginning in 2018. In cancer more generally, overall survival is the gold standard. We entered 2018 with fresh overall survival data in our labels for KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO. KYPROLIS has established strong share in second and later lines of multiple myeloma therapy. We expect the addition of overall survival data to strengthen its appeal to physicians, payers and patients. With overall survival for relapse refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients BLINCYTO was a game changer in its own right, but importantly it provides confidence for the long-term outlook for our broader BiTE platform. We have 12 BiTE programs progressing in both liquid and solid tumors. And data over the next 2 years will inform the future for many of these molecules. 2018 will be another year of new product launches for Amgen. In addition to our launch plans for Aimovig, we are extending our long-standing leadership in nephrology with the launch of Parsabiv, a specialty product for kidney disease in a number of companies \u2013 countries rather, including the U.S. Finally, I want to highlight that we have clarity now around AMGEVITA, our adalimumab biosimilar. And we look forward to launching that internationally later in the year. This will be the first of our biosimilars to launch. We have a strong portfolio coming behind it with one other approval already and several Phase 3 programs waiting approval and launch. We think these recommend \u2013 represent compelling growth opportunities for us around the world. We think tax reform provides a number of important benefits for our company. First, it puts us on a more level playing field strategically with our international competitors who previously were advantaged by lower rates and global access to their cash. Second, in addition to a more level playing field, tax reform clearly provides incentives for us to invest heavily in innovation and advanced technologies here in the U.S. and that is exactly what we will do. The timing of tax reform is particularly relevant for us right now as we are on the cusp of deploying our so-called next-generation bio-manufacturing technologies, which enable us to make biologics with much improved productivity, a smaller footprint and much reduced levels of waste and environmental impact. We developed these technologies in the U.S. and thanks to tax reform. We will now build new manufacturing capacity and add highly skilled jobs here in the U.S. to capitalize on them. It\u2019s worth noting that with tax reform we will make product in the U.S. and export it to cover 85% of our international sales. With improved clarity on tax reform, we expect to invest on the order of $2.5 billion in capital expenditures in the U.S. over the next 5 years. We see tax reform benefiting us in other areas as well. Amgen Ventures, our vehicle for early-stage investing will also make close to $300 million available for new investments in innovative biotechnology, digital healthcare information companies. We will also grow our already substantial commitment to our communities with plans for the Amgen Foundation\u2019s investments in the proven Amgen scholars and Amgen biotech experienced programs, which we expect to reach $100 million of commitment within 4 years. We have engaged some 600,000 high school and college students in person through these programs consider this our commitment to helping build a pipeline of talented scientists and biologists in the U.S. and beyond. Through our Foundation\u2019s philanthropic giving, we expect to deploy $100 million over the next 5 years in the communities where we work and live. We have also assessed the tax reform will be generally positive for our staff, especially for our non-executive U.S. staff who number about 12,000. We estimate that lower personal tax rates, combined with investments we are making in enhancing base wages for these staff, will create literally thousands of dollars of improvement in the average take-home pay for our typical U.S. non-executive staff member. When you pair all of this with the fact that some 90% of all Amgen staff members globally have held Amgen stock, you can see that the benefits of tax reform will be quite broad. Finally, tax reform also provides us with more flexibility for capital deployment. Since 2011, we have invested more than $42 billion in research and development, innovation-based acquisitions and long-term oriented capital expenditures. We expect to continue making such long-term investments now, while also being able to return excess capital to our shareholders in the form of growing dividends and share buybacks. Based on our confidence and the long-term outlook for the business is enhanced by the benefits of tax reform we have increased our share repurchase authorization by $10 billion. We expect to retire shares on an accelerated basis this year as David will describe shortly. As I highlighted for you, the benefits of tax reform for our shareholders do not come at the expense of others, but come in addition to the investments that we are making for our staff, the patients we are seeking to serve and our communities. So, to reiterate, we are operating the business well. You have seen that in our financials and you saw it in our successful response to the extraordinary challenge of Hurricane Maria too. Our in-market products are strong. We have attractive assets advancing in the pipeline and we have a strong balance sheet. Strategically, we are well-positioned to adapt to the growing pressures in the healthcare environment and to capitalize on consolidation opportunities for our shareholders. Let me conclude with a word of thanks to our staff around the world for their tireless devotion to our mission. I can assure you they are focused on serving patients and driving growth in 2018 and beyond. Let\u2019s turn to David. David Meline : Okay. Thanks Bob. Before I review our results and guidance, I would like to take a moment to reflect on our performance over the last several years. As Bob mentioned, we entered 2017 as another year, which presented significant challenges related to the transition of our portfolio as well as the evolving competitive dynamics of the industry as a whole. In the face of these expected and other not so expected challenges including Hurricane Maria, I am pleased to report that we delivered positive performance again in 2017. Additionally, with regard to our 5-year goals, we have already delivered or have clear line of sight to delivering on the commitments we established in 2014. The first goal was to achieve a substantial improvement in our operating efficiency agility and speed with the resulting outcome of the non-GAAP operating margin between 52% and 54%, representing a 15 point increase at the midpoint. We achieved this objective starting in 2016, 2 years ahead of our commitment. Second, in 2017 we delivered the $1.5 billion transformation savings commitment and will exceed that goal in 2018. Third through our next-generation bio-manufacturing capability as well as other efforts to optimize our fixed capital infrastructure, we are on track to meet our 2018 goal of reducing our facility footprint by 23%. Finally, based on today\u2019s 2018 guidance I am pleased to confirm our expected delivery on the other key objectives of both double digit non-GAAP EPS growth and providing returns to shareholders of at least 60% of non-GAAP net income on average during the period 2014 to 2018. These commitments are being achieved before benefiting from tax reform which further enhances Amgen\u2019s performance in 2018 and beyond. Now let\u2019s turn to the fourth quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck. Revenue at $5.8 billion declined 3% year-over-year. This quarter we saw worldwide product sales at $5.6 billion as unit demand from our growth products largely offset mature product declines. We are particularly encouraged by our 10% year-over-year volume growth in markets outside the U.S. reflecting the value of our innovative products in these international markets, many of which have experienced biosimilar competition and portfolio transition for a number of years. Other revenues at $233 million, decreased $69 million year-over-year as a result of the milestone payment received in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the out-licensing of AMG 139. Our Q4 non-GAAP operating income at $2.6 billion declined 11% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 45.9% for the quarter. As previously indicated our operating expenses reflected the typical underlying fourth quarter pattern. We also experienced a number of additional expenses in the quarter including $79 million of Hurricane Maria recovery costs, incremental expenses accelerated for tax planning purposes, as well as inventory related costs. Finally, we increased our investments in support of volume driven growth as we expand activities for our products addressing unmet medical needs in large patient populations, including launch preparations in advance of the upcoming Aimovig launch. These increases were partially offset by continued favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories and the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment on October 31, 2016. Other income and expenses were a net $31 million expense in Q4. This is favorable $171 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year favorability was primarily due to higher interest income, gains in our venture portfolio and gains from investment portfolio rebalancing in the fourth quarter of this year, coupled with favorable compares on both of these items in 2016. A portion of these activities were taken in anticipation of changes in tax and accounting standards effective in 2018. The non-GAAP tax rate was 16.6% for the quarter, a 2.1 point improvement versus Q4 of 2016 reflecting favorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings this year. While not impacting our non-GAAP P&L, we incurred a $6.1 billion charge on our fourth quarter GAAP P&L related to U.S. corporate tax reform, including the repatriation tax and revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities. The repatriation tax will be paid to the U.S. government over an 8-year period. Non-GAAP net income decreased 3% and non-GAAP earnings per share, was flat year-over-year for the fourth quarter. Please find a summary of our 2017 full year results on Page 7 of the presentation. Our 2017 full year revenues declined 1% to $22.85 billion, while our non-GAAP earnings per share grew 8% to $12.58 per share. For the full year, we saw flat worldwide product sales growth of $21.8 billion. Changes in foreign exchange had a 1% negative impact to total revenue and product sales for the full year on a year-over-year basis. For the full year, non-GAAP operating income at $11.7 billion grew 2% from prior year, including $146 million of nonrecurring expenses associated with the recovery from Hurricane Maria. Our non-GAAP operating margin improved by 1.2 points to 53.5% for the year as we realized the benefits from our ongoing transformation initiatives and the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payment. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 5.2 points to 13.5% driven primarily by expenses related to Hurricane Maria recovery efforts. Unfavorable product mix and other inventory costs offset partially by lower royalties and manufacturing cost efficiencies. Research and development decreased 7% year-over-year driven primarily by lower external business development expenses and lower spending required to support certain later stage clinical programs. SG&A expenses decreased 2% year-over-year due to the expiration of the Enbrel residual royalty partially offset by our increasing investments to drive volume growth in our products, which address unmet needs in large patient populations. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 3% year-over-year to $11.2 billion. Through the end of 2017, overall operating expenses have decreased by approximately $500 million versus 2013 levels. Included within this total is an incremental annual expense of $1.5 billion required to launch and maintain new products, build out new therapeutic areas, advance our biosimilars business and increase our global presence. Other income and expenses were favorable by $255 million on a year-over-year basis due to higher interest income on our higher cash balances as well as venture portfolio gains and milestones we realized across the course of the year. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18% for the full year, down 0.8 points versus 2016. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by changes in the geographic mix of earnings offset partially by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation payments. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 8. For the full year 2017, Amgen continued to demonstrate strong and durable cash flow generation with $10.5 billion in free cash flow versus $9.6 billion last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher operating income and favorable changes in working capital. Cash and investments increased to $41.7 billion. This balance included $3.1 billion in the U.S. and $38.6 billion outside the U.S. Total debt outstanding at year end totaled $35.3 billion and carries a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% and an average maturity of 12 years. In 2017, we deployed $3.1 billion to repurchase 18.5 million shares at an average of $169 per share. At the end of 2017, we had $4.4 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. Additionally for 2017, we increased our dividend per share by 15% to $1.15 per quarter, with payments totaling $3.4 billion. Based on our confidence in the future outlook for the enterprise and our continued commitment to our capital allocation strategy, we also announced a 15% increase to the dividend to $1.32 per share for the first quarter of 2018. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2018 on Page 9, 2018 will be another important year for Amgen as we continue investing in the pipeline, building out our global business and supporting our new product growth. In anticipation of this opportunity we transform the business over the past several years to enable us to fully invest from a position of strength. This transformation allows us to deliver industry leading financial performance while continuing to invest for long-term growth and success. Our 2018 revenue guidance is $21.8 billion to $22.8 billion and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $12.60 to $13.70 per share. Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance reflecting the impact of tax reform is 14% to 15% and we expect capital expenditures of approximately $750 million this year. There are several key assumptions embedded in our outlook that I would like to take a moment to share. First, our revenue guidance reflects both continued positive momentum from our newer products as well as evolving competitive dynamics related to our legacy products. We have important growth opportunities with the inclusion of outcomes data in Repatha\u2019s label. Our plan to launch new products including Aimovig and AMGEVITA and the added flexibility enabled by tax reform to use our strong cash flow and balance sheet to drive continued growth of the company. We also embrace the potential challenges including the possible generic competition to Sensipar, continuing competitive dynamics for Enbrel and expected new competition against Neulasta and Aranesp. With regard to Sensipar, although the composition of matter patent expires in March, we are involved in litigation over pediatric exclusivity with the FDA and separately over the formulation patent with potential generic competitors. Although we believe in the strength of our position uncertainty as to the timing of competition will remain until the outcome of these litigations becomes clear. Also note that historically the first quarter represents the lowest product sales quarter for the year. For 2018, we expect this pattern to continue. Tony will provide further details related to this in this remarks. With respect to other revenue, for the full year 2018 we expect to see 15% year-over-year growth. The quarterly run rate will be impacted by an unfavorable true up of a royalty in Q1, offset by incremental milestones in the second half of the year. From an operating margin perspective since 2016 we have delivered on our commitment of a non-GAAP operating margin between 52% and 54%. And based on today\u2019s guidance we expect to again operate in this range in 2018 as we continue to invest in our products to drive volume growth in large patient populations. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate incremental investments including acquisitions to drive growth and maximize shareholder value. The recently passed tax reform legislation provides significant financial flexibility in the form of a globally competitive tax rate and immediate access to the year end 2017 ex-U.S. cash balance of $39 billion. With regard to 2018 guidance, our non-GAAP tax rate is forecast between 14% and 15%. This incorporates a 21% tax rate on U.S. earnings and 10.5% tax rate on ex-U.S. earnings. With regard to capital deployment, our principles over the next several years are as follows. First, we will invest in our business as we continue to expand our pipeline and seek to drive long-term volume growth globally across large patient populations. We will also invest in greater manufacturing capacity to support the volume growth we foresee. For the first time in several decades, tax reform enables us to competitively consider investment in the U.S. As a result over the next 5 years we expect to invest approximately $3.5 billion in capital expenditures. Starting in 2018, approximately 75% of that investment will be in the U.S., up from about 50% in recent years. As Bob mentioned a key component of our U.S. capital investment strategy includes a new drug substance manufacturing plant which will be built using our next-generation bio-manufacturing capability. We expect to complete this expansion in about half the time of a conventional plant for approximately one-third of the cost. In addition to investing internally, we continued to pursue external opportunities to accelerate the growth of our business in our chosen therapeutic areas as well as accelerating our global build-out. Furthermore, we will invest an additional $300 million in our venture fund. Our venture fund is an important tool to ensuring we are appropriately informed, engaged and invested in cutting edge advances in science, technology and innovation. Since 2004, we have invested over $0.5 billion in our venture funds. In addition to their scientific importance, these investments have generated returns well above our cost of capital. Second, we will remain committed to an optimal capital structure in order to minimize or weighted average cost of capital by deploying any excess accumulative \u2013 accumulated capital and fully deploying cash flows going forward. As a first step to accomplishing this objective, we have received Board authorization to purchase up to $10 billion of our common stock. This is an addition to the previously approved share repurchase authorization which remained at $4.4 billion at the end of 2017. Given the scale of excess capital we have to deploy, our plan is to proceed with the Dutch auction equity tender offer, consistent with the approach we used successfully in 2011. This tender offer would be for up to $10 million and would commence as early as next week. Further, we may repurchase up to our full authority in the first half of 2018. The optimization of a capital structure will result in higher net interest expense in 2018 and beyond as we will have less interest income due to lower cash balances. For 2018 this results in expected other income and expense of $600 million to $700 million net expense. As we deploy our excess capital in the most efficient manner over the next several years, we could find that it is important prudent to pay some upcoming debt maturities in cash rather than refinancing in the market. This would translate directly into additional financial flexibility and debt capacity that we could choose to redeploy in the future. Third, we will continue to provide meaningful returns to shareholders through both the previously mentioned share repurchases as well as continued dividend growth. Finally, today\u2019s revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance ranges are wider than we typically have provided at the start of the year, which is primarily a reflection of the range of sense of our scenarios in addition to the other ongoing uncertainties outlined earlier. It is important to recognize that our guidance today does not include the impact of potential future M&A activities. In summary, we delivered another year of strong financial results in 2017 and we remain confident in the outlook for Amgen success in 2018 and beyond. This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Tony. Tony Hooper : Thank you, David. I would like to begin with a few comments on our overall performance in 2017 followed by a review of our product performance. On the full year basis 2017 sales were in line with 2016 as the growth of our newer products offset the decline in our mature brands. We saw this play out again in quarter four as robust volume growth led by Prolia and our recently launched brands offset volume declines in Enbrel, ESAs and NEUPOGEN. Our international performance in quarter four led by Europe as David said was strong with 70% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven by volume growth of 10%. The European portfolio has already transitioned to the majority of sales from newer brands leading to strong volume growth for the overall portfolio. I am pleased with our execution in 2017 and our team has made excellent progress across a number of strategic fronts in building the foundation for long-term volume driven growth. We drove volume growth across several important brands led by Prolia. We defended Enbrel and several of our material brands against increasing competition. And we executed some patient focused lifecycle management strategies. We continue to advance our recently launched products with impressive new clinical data. The most significant of course being Repatha OUTCOMES data as well as three new sets of overall survival data, two for KYPROLIS and one for BLINCYTO. We also began laying the foundation for our next wave of launches as we prepare for Aimovig, a migraine product in the U.S. and AMGEVITA, our Humira biosimilar in Europe later this year. This will be an exciting milestone as we begin to commercialize our biosimilars in 2018. I am confident that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities within our portfolio of innovative and differentiated medicines. Turning now to our product performance, Prolia ended 2017 with another impressive quarter of 24% growth year-over-year. On a full year basis, Prolia grew 20% and as Bob said now presold with 3.5 million patients globally. In the U.S. we achieved a record number of new patient starts in 2017. After 7 years in the market this growth of new patient initiation underscores the continuing unmet medical need. Once patients are initiated on Prolia we have a good track record of sustained repeat injections. While this is a great progress, there are 100 million patients worldwide who suffer from osteoporosis. In the U.S. one in every two women above 50 will suffer an osteoporotic fracture. So we continue to work to improve both the diagnosis and the treatment of osteoporosis as we grow Prolia\u2019s market share within the market. With this unique profile and through continued and sustained investment, we expect Prolia will remain a very strong growth driver. Turning on to our oncology brands, KYPROLIS grew 24% year-over-year with strong performance internationally. Uptake in these markets remains robust. Fourth quarter sales in Europe have doubled from the fourth quarter 2016. In the U.S. KYPROLIS now has two compelling sets of overall survival data in both doublet and triplet regimens that demonstrate a 21% reduction in the risk of death versus standard of care in each setting. The FDA just approved adding the impressive overall survival data from endeavor study to a label. KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone is the only preferred doublet regimen in the NCCN Guidelines. We look forward to the equally impressive overall survival data from ASPIRE being added to our label later this year. These data are, without doubt, differentiators and should reset the treatment paradigm as the new standard of care for relapse multiple myeloma patients. Our focused message to physicians is pretty clear. Patients will relapse or live longer when treated with regimen that includes KYPROLIS. And early indications are showing that this is presenting well as KYPROLIS share up new relapsed or effective patients continues to improve. XGEVA grew 4% year-over-year driven by a combination of volume growth, changes in the inventory and net selling price. We are pleased to begin the year with the FDA\u2019s approval to expanding XGEVA label to include the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with multiple myeloma. This approval was nearly a month ahead of the producer date and within five days of approval the first multiple myeloma patient received an injection of XGEVA. A large portion over 100,000 multiple myeloma patients in the U.S. are at risk for bone complications. XGEVA can help these patients as many of them cannot be effectively be treated with zoledronic acid due to renal insufficiency. CMS has recognized this issue and has designated XGEVA as a novel therapy for these patients. This is another example of our lifecycle management strategy and investment in volume driven growth. Neulasta sales were flat year-over-year as we continue to see low single-digit decline in the use of myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens due to growth in new and less toxic therapies. Onpro continues to gain traction and we exited 2017 slightly above 60% of the U.S. Neulasta units sold. Its compelling value proposition for patients and the healthcare system is clear. It delivers better adherence to therapy, lower rates of febrile neutropenia and hospitalization and more convenience for patients and oncology practices. Our patent protected Onpro will be an important point of differentiation in the marketplace against future potential competition. On the topic of potential new competition during the last year in the U.S., we know there continue to be a serious amount of questions about where the competitors will be announcing their arrival in the market for some years now. We will be able to succeed with regulators and in the courts such as they could finally come to market in the second half of 2018. If they do arrive we will be ready for them. With Neupogen, the impact of short-acting biosimilars in the fourth quarter were consistent with prior trends as we exited 2017 with maybe 40% unit share on the short-acting market. We continue to maintain pricing discipline since the entry of competitors. Now turning to Enbrel which declined 13% year-over-year, underlying volume demand was in line with prescription trends in the fourth quarter. Second, growth in rheumatology and dermatology as well as changes in Enbrel\u2019s volume share across each segment was in line with prior quarters. As I told you last quarter maintaining Enbrel\u2019s strong forming position and patient access is resulting in a small decline in net selling price. We expect the fourth quarter trends for both unit demand and net selling price to continue into 2018. You will also recall the first quarter last year was the lowest quarter of 2017 as insurance re-verifications and patient deductibles reset for the new calendar year. We expect to experience similar dynamics this year and therefore expect Enbrel\u2019s first quarter to be the lowest sales for 2018, representing approximately 20% of full year 2018 sales. Critical to our strategy of Enbrel is the ongoing pursuit of innovative ways to enhance patient experience and to differentiate our product. The Enbrel Mini with AutoTouch was recently launched along with a new low-paying formulation. This is a multiuse device, specifically designed to be used with ease by rheumatoid arthritis patients. Patient feedback has been very positive on these new innovations and we are also very proud of the positive environmental benefits of this reusable auto injector. Switching now out to our ESA portfolio, Slide 21 shows the 2017 composition of our ESA business. Aranesp declined by about 7% on a year-over-year basis with lower unit demand, favorable prior year adjustments and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. With EPOGEN the underlying business remained relatively stable with the primary driver being lower net selling price as a result of our extended supply agreement with DaVita until 2022. Over the last couple of years we have grown our U.S. Aranesp business by converting the medium size and independent dialysis centers from EPOGEN to Aranesp. As of we are aware that our long-acting competitor has recently extended their product offering to these dialysis customers, so we expect to lose some of this business as early as this quarter. We are also preparing to compete for their potential short-acting biosimilar in all customer segments including hospitals and clinics if and when such a biosimilar is approved by the FDA. Our long track record of safety, efficacy and reliable safety, supplier and reliable supply is a competitive advantage that Amgen has always had. Turning now to cosmetics, beginning with Parsabiv, we continue to launch Parsabiv in new markets throughout the world. This includes launching in the U.S. last month. As the head-to-head clinical data showed Parsabiv demonstrated a greater level of efficacy when compared to Sensipar. Since the products has administered in the patient\u2019s existing IV line during dialysis it was controlled into the hands of the healthcare provider which could drive an improved level of adherence. Nephrologists continue to be positive and are excited about having the product available. As David mentioned, the 2018 outlook for Sensipar is somewhat uncertain given the ongoing litigations. It is of course conceivable that competitors maybe able to bring generic products to market at some point in 2018 although we believe we have strong litigation positions. With Repatha we continued to execute competitively maintaining our majority share on a global basis. We are very excited to exit 2017 with the expedited approval by the FDA of Repatha outcomes data. This is very important milestone for Repatha and its potential to help cardiovascular patients at high risk of heart attacks and strokes. Our team can now for the first time speak directly to the benefits of treating patients with the Repatha and its ability to reduce the risk of heart attack by 27% and stroke by 21%, as well as further event reductions after the first year of treatment. Our sales teams were trained are in the field shortly after the approval and are receiving positive feedback from physicians. It\u2019s still early days since the approval, but signs are pointing in the right direction with NBRX guidance. We do however expect quarter one sales to be relatively flat sequentially as Repatha faces similar dynamics as Enbrel related to insurance reverification and resetting of patient out of pocket costs in the first quarter. We continue to work payers to improve patient access and are making progress. Our priority remains reaching the large population of high risk cardiovascular patients. The cost to society of not treating these presentations is unacceptable. And we are looking at all options to improve access for appropriate high risk patients. We also look forward to having the Repatha labels updated with the outcomes data outside the U.S. soon. So 2018 will be an important year as we continue transition of our portfolio and lay the groundwork for sustainable volume driven long-term growth. In closing, I would like to thank our team for their impressive and competitive execution in 2017. I look forward to facing with them the challenges and more importantly the opportunities. In 2018 we are bringing our innovative medicines to previously healed patients around the world. And I will pass it to Sean. Sean? Sean Harper : Thanks Tony. Good afternoon. I will begin with cardiovascular, with the recent inclusion of our cardiovascular outcomes data in U.S. label Repatha is the first and only PCSK9 inhibitor approved to prevent heart attacks, stroke and coronary revascularization in adults with established cardiovascular disease. We now have numerous professional guidelines and treatment pathways along with the FDA all recognizing the ability of Repatha to reduce life changing events from stroke and heart attack. And we expect payers to take an increasingly more thoughtful approach to patient access. In inflammation, we began dosing Tezepelumab in our 52-week Phase 3 study in over 1,000 patients with severe uncontrolled asthma in our collaboration with AstraZeneca. I would note that the primary endpoint in our Phase 3 program is the same as the one we reported for the Phase 2b study where we demonstrated efficacy across a broad spectrum of patient types. We have also reacquired our IL15 antagonist antibody AMG 714 after our cell immune collaboration generated intriguing Phase 2a data in severe celiac disease. We will be discussing the data and potential path forward with regulators are they are not clearly established endpoints for registration in this area. In neuroscience we and Novartis are looking forward to the FDA PDUFA date for Aimovig in May. I am often asked about our approach with the CGR receptor antibody versus the ligand and how it differentiates. We targeted the receptor because we wanted the most potent antibody we could develop to reduce the amount of antibody required for maximal clinical effect. And our expertise in antibody discovery and development allowed us to succeed at this. With Aimovig we can elicit maximal CGRP inhibition with a relatively low doubts we have submitted 70 milligram and 140 milligram per month to regulators compared with higher doses with the ligand sequestrants. This translates into monthly subcutaneous self-administration with the pen type auto injector that uniquely does not require loading doses which we believe will be much more attractive the patients and providers. Also as we have seen in other diseases having mechanistic choices is an attractive option for physicians and patients. And Aimovig is the first and only CGRP receptor antibody ever introduced to the clinic. We have also executed a differentiated development program with Aimovig with a dedicated cardiovascular treadmill study in patients with stable angina and most recently demonstrated efficacy in a large study of patients with multiple prophylactic treatment failures who are not only considered difficult to treat, but also have virtually no other treatment options. Turning to oncology and KYPROLIS, the U.S. prescribing information was recently updated with the overall survival data from endeavor which also received a positive opinion in Europe. The ASPIRE overall survival data have also been submitted in both regions. Having survival data from two studies established KYPROLIS as the new standard of care for relapsed multiple myeloma. XGEVA was recently approved for the prevention of skeletal related events in multiple myeloma for patients in the U.S. As Tony mentioned, this is an important advance as myeloma patients often develop renal insufficiency, which hinders treatment with bisphosphonates putting them at increased risk for bone complications. XGEVA is not cleared through the kidneys and provides an important new treatment option. We also received the results of the Phase 3D care study, with XGEVA. D-CARE was initiated in 2010. With the hypothesis, the treatment with denosumab could potentially delay cancer recurrence in bone or other tissues in patients with early-stage breast cancer. D-CARE explored an investigational dosing schedule of denosumab as adjuvant treatment for women in high-risk early breast cancer stages receiving standard of care neoadjuvant or adjuvant cancer therapy. Unfortunately, the trial was neutral and did not meet its primary endpoint of bone metastasis free survival. Adverse events observed in patients treated with XGEVA were similar to the known safety profile. Detailed results will be submitted to the future medical conference and/or publication. I\u2019d like to stress this result has no bearing on the approved and well-established indication for the prevention of skeletal-related events in breast cancer patients with bone metastases. Finally, in other European regulatory news, Nplate received a positive opinion in Europe recommending approval for the treatment of chronic ITP for patients 1 year of age or older were refractory to other treatments and BLINCYTO received a CHMP positive opinion to include overall survival data from the Phase 3 TOWER trial supporting conversion from conditional to full market authorization in the current indication. We had the opportunity to provide a detailed update on our oncology franchise and our excitement around our differentiated approach to immunooncology at the American Society of Hematology Meeting in December. There we announced that we developed a half-life extended BiTE format and had moved three of these into the clinic, with several others in preclinical development. We now have 7 BiTE programs in the clinic and expect data generated in the next 18 to 24 months in both hematologic and solid tumors to provide key insights on the clinical utility of this platform. We are in the unique position to evaluate both BiTE and CAR-T programs, in some cases, directed against the same antigen and in fact we have an IND in place for our first CAR-T from the Gilead, Kite collaboration. We will begin dosing patients a bit later this year. We also highlighted our commitment to multiple myeloma specifically with our MCL-1 and 2 inhibitor; 2 BCMA targeted BiTEs and a BCMA antibody drug conjugate all moving through Phase 1 and our bi-specific T-cell engaging antibody directed against CD38 licensed from Zencor, which will begin dosing this year as well. In our bone franchise, UCB recently submitted EVENITY in Europe for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture. We continue to systematically reevaluate all registrational clinical trial data to ensure we have the most comprehensive understanding of the cardiovascular safety signal observed in the active-comparator ARCH study. And we will work in close collaboration with the FDA toward our resubmission under the complete response letter timelines in the U.S. later this year. Lastly, we continue to make good progress on our biosimilars with the European approval of our biosimilar, Avastin. We also expect Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis data from ABP 710, our biosimilar REMICADE later in the year. In closing, I would like to thank all of my colleges at Amgen for another year of successfully advancing programs for the benefit of patients. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay, thanks. Skinner, let\u2019s go straight to the questions and could you please remind our callers of the procedure for asking questions and let me just give them a heads up that will go longer than usual because advertising at the beginning of my remarks we were going to be little bit longer in our prepared portion. So, we will stay and take the questions from the analysts. Skinner, let\u2019s jump to it. Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citigroup. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, can you really be clear about what percentage of your write-ins was influenced by biosimilars to what looks a real impact? And for Sean, when you think about your pipeline which is really broad and [indiscernible] all the options that are available? And now, when you think about the probably adjusted value in the pipeline, can you help us understand how to value that pipeline to offset the biosimilar impact? Thanks. Bob Bradway : Okay, Robyn, we are having a little bit difficulty hearing you, but I think your first question was unlike was one that we should ask David to address, I think you were asking how much of the wide range in revenue guidance was attributable to biosimilar. So, I think David try to make it clear that a lot of it was related to Sensipar, but we are going to have David to address that. David Meline : Yes, right. So, if you look at the guidance that we offered it\u2019s obviously much larger than we would typically have about double what we would have at the beginning of the year. And certainly, a large portion of that is attributable to the uncertainty around the launch, the competitive launches that may occur this year from Sensipar. So, that\u2019s the primary driver of the broader guidance than we typically would offer. Bob Bradway : And again, Robyn, it wasn\u2019t clear what you are trying to get at with your question was the pipeline, but Sean go ahead. Sean Harper : Yes. I mean, I think it had to do with the value of the pipeline versus obviously the pressures we are facing on some of our legacy products as they go through the portfolio transition. I would just say that you are right, Robyn, we do have a very broad and deep capability these days. It\u2019s the best it\u2019s ever been at Amgen in my opinion. And I think that what you can observe is that across the key therapeutic areas that we are focusing in, we have a lot of really exciting opportunities. And I think that we can expect to see the same sort of productivity with respect to advancing the pipeline over the next 5 years that we have observed over the last 5 years. Bob Bradway : Okay, let\u2019s go to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray. Chris Raymond : Thanks for taking the question. So, I have a question that I think it mostly related to Enbrel, there has been some dust kicked up recently with regard to payers in PBMs instituting some so-called co-pay accumulators, which don\u2019t allow co-pay assistance and other patient assistance to count against deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. From what I have read you guys have seemed to taking a really strong stance against this with some specific countermeasures and you are working to ensure that patient support actually benefits the patient. But I am just hoping if you could maybe put some brackets around the ranges of uptake that this phenomenon could have this year. And what other specific countermeasures you could take if your current measures don\u2019t work? Thanks. Tony Hooper : It\u2019s Tony. So, let me respond to that one. You are correct that Amgen has made it pretty clear that we disagree with the concept of the accumulator. That fundamentally, our systems is, a, to assist patients who can\u2019t afford their co-pays that the agreements and contracts we have with these organizations is around making sure if patients get access. So, we put that in writing and made it clear to people. As I look at quarter one, I see a minimal impact to our Enbrel business because of these programs. Operator : And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much for your question and for all the color in the presentation. Perhaps, David, could you comment a little bit on your balance sheet, you sort of alluded to the fact that there maybe some moving thoughts in your balance sheet and obviously you are bringing a lot of cash back. You are effectively un-levered despite the fact that you have significant debt given your cash position. As you look at opportunities across the industry, Bob, has been sort of quiet outspoken about the need for consolidation. And just wondering what kind of leverage would you be comfortable with given the visibility you have for the future cash flow. Would you be willing to sort of go up on a net basis to several times your EBITDA? David Meline : Yes, Geoff. So, I guess the way I would think about the balance sheet going forward is I would look at how we have managed the balance sheet over these last several years. And we did that to optimize and get the lowest weighted average cost of capital and we did that without consideration of the offshore cash balances. So, we set our leverage and it\u2019s varied over the last several years out of peak after Onyx and then it\u2019s come down since that time. And I think it would be fair to assume that on a steady state basis, we would think about those kinds of balance sheet leverage ratios to be similar to what we have had in the past. Now, what I would say is that in the very near-term given the fact that we have such a large amount of capital that we will be deploying, it\u2019s quite possible as I mentioned in my comments, but we would pay some debt in the interim, but that wouldn\u2019t be mistaken to be where we think the ideal capital structure would be. So, I would refer again without reference to the cash we have been carrying, but just look at our leverage over these last several years, I think it\u2019s a good sort of guidepost for how we will manage the business going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just a question for David, can you comment whether the guided 14% to 15% tax rate for 2018 is actually also the way we should think about a long-term tax rate? And then in 4Q \u201817 your OpEx went a bit higher than usual, do you expect the margin, the pre-tax operating margin to go back to the level you saw in the first three quarters in 2017 for the 2018 period? Thank you. David Meline : Yes, sure. So, in terms of the tax rate post-2018, what I would say is that if you look at our guide for this year on a non-GAAP basis at 14% to 15%, our preliminary analysis would suggest to us that, that would be a reasonable outlook for the period post 2018 and I use some words preliminary and that sort of thing, because it\u2019s still evolving, but I think as a starting point, I think it\u2019s reasonable to think about that as a steady state type level of tax rate going forward. And then in terms of you are correct as I tried to articulate if you look at our operating expense performance in Q4, basically we typically have as you know, we typically have the highest level of expense is in Q4 on an annual basis. And to the extent, we had expenses beyond that this past year in Q4 of \u201817 those were basically an entirely one-time type expenses that we wouldn\u2019t expect to be recurring and that was related as I said to the hurricane costs, which are extraordinary and one-time as well as based on the fact that we had last year 35% tax rate versus taxes this year at 21% in the U.S. We looked at choices we might make around the timing of such discretionary expenses and time them into the period where we got to benefit from a tax perspective. So, with all of that, you go to 2018 as I said, our guidance would suggest to you until us that we expect to operate in the 52% to 54% range again this year. And I think you can expect the quarter-by-quarter patterns of margins and expenses to be quite consistent with what you have seen if you look at an average over the last several years. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Great. Thanks for taking the question. David, I was hoping you could just help us breakout some items for 2018 guidance, particularly since you have got a couple of moving pieces in terms of the bottom line here if you could help us think about the impact that the tax rate had the impact of the buyback versus the underlying performance of the business? Thanks. David Meline : Yes. So, I guess what I would say is that if you \u2013 well, first of all, I think the tax calculation is pretty straightforward in terms of take the 14% to 15% range and apply it to what would be pre-tax profit. I think I gave you a range in terms of both operating margin and what we expected below the line interest expense and income to be. So, I think that hopefully will get you to a pre-tax income that you can apply the tax rate against. And then in terms of the repurchase activity, we now have authorization in total of little more than $14 billion for repurchases. And as I said, we could see that deployed as soon as you know completion in the first half. Our guidance of course takes into consideration that if there is some range of timing possibilities that our guidance covers in terms of the repurchase effects. So, again I think you can apply some math to get to the share count and how that would impact your EPS. Then it\u2019s included in the guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up to Jeff\u2019s earlier question, Bob during your prepared remarks you mentioned you are well-positioned to capitalize on consolidation opportunities for your shareholders, just wondering if you would consider larger scale mergers or is that primarily built on similar to your prior history is Onyx is a recent example? Thanks. Bob Bradway : Well, I said two things Terence. I said we are well-positioned to address ongoing changes in healthcare environment. And we expect there will continue the ongoing pressure from the healthcare environment and that we were also well-positioned to capitalize on consolidation for the benefit of our shareholders. So we have been consistent for some time in saying that that we have the financial capacity and we are interested in looking for deals that we think we can add value to in our areas of focus, so we are going to continue to do that. And as the other question implied we have felt for some time that there are pockets of excess capacity in the industry and we will look to see whether we can help create some value by being part of the consolidation around those. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael Yee : Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. When I think about your 2018 guidance, I am sure that people are trying to get the details of that, but I am certainly trying to think that there is more uncertainties about beyond 2018, back in 2014 you gave a long-term strategic outlook and we delivered on that. But I think people are kind of worried about beyond 2018, what are the factors that you need to get through Bob or Dave to think about longer term guidance or maybe there is no need for longer term guidance, what are you thinking about? Thanks. Bob Bradway : We will both take a shot at your question Mike. I think you are right, we felt there was a big disconnect in 2014. And we were confident about the long-term outlook. And we seem to be at a different place from our shareholders. So we found it\u2019s helpful to try and address that disconnect with longer term guidance. And we are \u2013 as we said, I think each of us said we are confident about the long-term outlook for our business now and excited about what we see as long-term growth potential of the company. But we continue to talk to our shareholders and get, take their counsel about the benefit of thinking about the guidance question. Operator : Our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Ronny Gal : Good evening and thank you to my questions. Just a quick clarification for Tony and then a question for Sean, Tony you mentioned that you are not seeing impact from the copay accelerator. My understanding of that, you will not expect to see one until late in the second quarter when patient begin to hit the maximum out-of-pocket costs. Do I have this wrong or is there something that we should see earlier in the year? And then for Sean on the BCMA program, obviously you guys are putting some resources against it, how good does those by specifics have to be for you just taking forward in comparison to what we are always seeing from a CAR T program since 50% or 70% or maybe just give us the parameters you are looking forward to see if the products are good enough? Tony Hooper : So Ronny, to answer your first part of your question, this is Tony, the accumulator programs would of course depend on what the individual patient\u2019s deductible is. And as I said we are seeing and predicting minimal impact in the first quarter. And by definition I would therefore see minimal impact in the second as well by Amgen. Sean Harper : Yes. With respect to our BCMA BiTE programs, I think our view is that it\u2019s going to be important for us to be able to demonstrate data. And these comparisons can be very complex, you know that the patient populations and the pretreatment of patients and things of this sort in the CAR T studies is often very different than this populations that we generate in our data set. So comparisons can be hard. But the bottom line is everyone that that we talk to in this field believes that if you can take a product like a BiTE off the shelf administers and get a similar degree of efficacy with potentially less of the safety risk and the enormous cost that can be associated with those safety risks in the hospital that BiTE would be a preferred modality. As I have said many times, I think there is a role for both of these modalities in the spectrum of care for even an individual patient in an oncology center. Operator : And our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to ask three if I may, one on court decisions on from PCSK9 antibody patents that we thought last year, do you think they have any read across to the upcoming Enbrel district court litigation. Second on Sensipar and it seems like it\u2019s a big swing factor in your 2018 guidance, my question is this, there was an IPR on one of your 2026 patents which was never instituted, so in that context, the question I have is how the generic entry possible or is that another way, are you aware of a non-infringing formulation. And then finally just a quick one, how much CGRP in your 2018 guidance? Thank you. Bob Bradway : So where is the third question, we are trying to track you there. David Meline : CGRP in the 2018 guidance. Bob Bradway : Okay. Umer, obviously we have ongoing litigation, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to comment on your sensible question. I wouldn\u2019t try to read across \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t try to do the meta-analysis in intellectual property land across the two trials that you referenced. David do you want\u2026? David Meline : We are obviously not going to give individual product guidance Umer at this point. We are excited about the product. We are excited about being first, so some dramatic population and the interest in having a new therapy that makes a big difference is high, but we are not going to give you individual product launch guidance at this point. Umer Raffat : Okay. Bob Bradway : Yes. Now let\u2019s take the next question and maybe you can just remind our audience as to limit themselves to one question, since we are running over way over today. Operator : Yes. Please limit yourselves to one question, ladies and gentlemen. And our next question does come from Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham : Good afternoon guys. Thanks for the question. Bob, when you think about deals, how much of a priority is a return to top line growth versus just managing cash flow? And then very related, have you guys have explored \u2013 ever explored a split or some sort of segmentation of the business, just to separate the mature franchises from the early cycle products and pipeline? Thanks. Bob Bradway : Okay. Geoff, our focus when we look at deals is on we are looking to deploy capital that we think we can only return for our shareholders from, so it\u2019s very easy to find accretive deals, it\u2019s very hard to find deals that are both accretive and add to the long-term return on capital for our shareholders. So we are going to continue to be disciplined. We know the six areas that we are interested in. And with respect your second question, again I think you know our track record in this regard. We have been very active and very focused on looking at all ways to create value for our shareholders and we will continue to do that. Operator : And our next question comes from Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company. Eric Schmidt : Okay. Just a question for Tony on Repatha, is I am doing the math right on Slide 23 would be the volume and sales gains that you had, it looks like there was a net 15% quarter-on-quarter decline in Repatha\u2019s price, is that true and maybe you can provide some color what\u2019s going on there? Thank you. Tony Hooper : Yes. I actually couldn\u2019t give you the details with that one right now. There was going to be a change in net price, but I don\u2019t think that it was that high. We can come back to you guys and give you the details on that. I don\u2019t have them with me. Operator : Our next question comes from Alethea Young from Credit Suisse. Alethea Young : Great. Thanks for taking my question. One for Sean, are there additional Phase 2 programs would you consider for Tezepelumab, maybe anything in allergies or anything like that things? Sean Harper : Yes. Right now, I think the things we are kind of excited about in Phase 2 are AMG301 in migraine, which is we are in a strong leading position with that mechanism and hope to see that it will be either synergistic with CGRP or address patients that don\u2019t respond to CGRP innovation. And we have also the aisle to new team program AMG592, I would highlight as a program that is moving into multiple Phase 2 autoimmune disorders. And that\u2019s a mechanism as you may know where we are able to affect the population of Treg cells in a profound way with this engineered form of IL-2. The number of our BiTE programs are while they are in Phase 1 that the next study for them could in fact like it was for BLINCYTO, be registration enabling. So this Phase 1, 2, 3 line gets pretty blurred in the oncology area particularly. So I consider a lot of the molecules that are in the clinic including our MCL1 inhibitor to be potentially in a pre-registration study as the next study type of status. Operator : And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory Kasimov : Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mine is on Repatha and I recognized it\u2019s really recent, but I missed it a little more color. On the early feedbacks you are getting from the field on the drug post the inclusion of CBOT in the label and really more importantly how much of a difference you expect the label to make given that you guys make it sound like it\u2019s still the payer access issue and payers have been aware of this data for a longer period of time? Thanks. Tony Hooper : So, Tony here. Let me respond to that one, right. So, as I have said a couple of times, since launch, we have been able to talk to physicians about the product being able to lower LDL from a promotional perspective, which is probably 98% of our physicians who don\u2019t attend large congresses, we have not been able to be in a position to talk about the real benefit of Repatha dramatically lowering LDL and thereby reducing the risk out of heart attack and stroke. Just to give you an idea of how fast this has moved, we got the approval on the Friday at about 11 :35 a.m. By Tuesday, we had trained our entire team of managers on actual promotional material. By the Thursday, we trained the entire sales force. By Saturday, we trained 250 cardiologists, speakers and by the next week, they had completed just over 200 speaker programs with an average of about 15 people attending each speaker program. I have never seen such rapid uptake of a speaker program from an exit \u2013 and these are promotional speaker programs, where the cardiologists are talking specifically from the new label. The feedback from sales force to-date has been very positive, people not truly understanding the value of what the drug does. And when I look at the last two weeks average NBRxs, they are about 18%, 20% higher than the average of the 4 weeks for December. So, yes, it\u2019s tough to read this early on, but we are seeing an uptick in new patients getting to getting approved. When I look at our payer or access environment, I see the commercial plans sort of January of 2017, are improving \u2013 have improved by about 8% in terms of the approvals. Our Part D coverage has improved by about 30%. So, we continue to work hard to make sure people understand the value of this drug. I think more and more cardiologists and physicians are putting forward appropriate patients and fighting for them to get on the drug. Operator : And our next question comes from Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities. Salim Syed : Yes, hi. Thanks guys for taking my question. I just had one on Repatha. So, Eugene Braunwald spoke recently at The Medicines Company Investor Day and spoke specifically regarding primary prevention with inclisiran. I was curious what your thoughts were on that and if there is any impact to Repatha as it relates to that. And specifically also do you think inclisiran can be inserted between a statin and Repatha? Thank you. Sean Harper : Yes, hi, this is Sean. I will try to respond. I think obviously the kinds of populations that can be addressed with these agents are identical to the kind of populations that have been treated with statins over the years, we focused on a very high risk secondary prevention type population, although our label in both the U.S. and Europe is broader than that. And I think that it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to study high-risk primary prevention patients. However, when you look at the situation we faced right now where it\u2019s so difficult to get these drugs to patients who have experienced multiple events and have very high levels of LDL. I am not sure that\u2019s the direction strategically that I would go if I were going to do another OUTCOMES trial, but it\u2019s a reasonable thing to do. In terms of sequencing these therapies, if that all depends on the effect size that can be achieved, the safety profile of the novel mechanism of platform technology like siRNA in a very broad population. The bar is extremely high obviously from an efficacy safety perspective with Repatha. Operator : And our next question comes from Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital Markets. Ian Somaiya : Thank you for taking my question. I had another one on Repatha. You have previously commented on maybe willingness to speak with payers or negotiated with payers on rebates and pricing once CVOT was in the label, I guess we have gotten to that point. And then separately once the guidelines reflected the recommendations, I am just curious where are we from a price rebate negotiation standpoint, how much room is there for us to see changes in sort of the pricing structure of the PCSK9 going forward? Tony Hooper : So, it\u2019s Tony. So as we have talked last year, we are in constant debate and discussion with payers and providers around the value of this drug, about the value-based pricing we have and the rebates that are being offered in the marketplace to ensure improved levels of access. So, we continue to work with the payers on an ongoing basis to ensure we get a good position on formulary that we have improved on the utilization management criteria with fundamentally just about every plan has improved on that one. Quite dramatically, we have with worked hard to ensure that we can assist patients where appropriate with co-pays that they are not able to afford or deductibles and unable to afford. And I don\u2019t think that work is going to stop for a while as we go forward. Operator : Next question comes from Andrew Peters from Deutsche Bank Equity Research. Andrew Peters : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So, I guess maybe to just switch gears a bit on a slightly different topic on the next-gen manufacturing side, just wanted to see how and if this new technology could potentially impact margins? And then more broadly as you talk about kind of the made by Amgen stamp for the biosimilar franchise, as you think about biosimilar production in general, how do you think Amgen is differentiated and from a margin perspective as you think about biosimilars, is that something that can fit into your pricing strategy on a competitive basis as well? Thank you. Bob Bradway : We take this in two parts. David and I can respond to your question, Andrew. First, with respect to next-generation manufacturing, we have been talking about this as you know for some time. We are delighted \u2013 and we are excited that global regulators have approved our first of these facilities in Singapore. And when we committed to that first again talking about some years ago we were clear that both as a consequence of lower capital cost and the meaningfully lower operating costs we would expect over time a benefit to be reflected across the sales line and that will happen. And generally we have said and we still believe that manufacturing is a source of competitive advantage at Amgen. We have a track record of supplying every patient every time and we think when it comes in particular to biosimilars, the reliability of the safe supply and reliable supply of biosimilar medicines from Amgen will be a differentiator. David Meline : Yes, I guess I would add when we set out on the journey to get to our current margin structure we talked about a number of things that were contributing to us achieving that and certainly as Bob just talked about the first module of this next-gen manufacturing is now going to be helping us and this next module will continue to enable us to drive our competitiveness. I would caution against thinking that you should think there is a big step up from where we are operating right now, because I think we are operating in a very nice place in terms of our own competitiveness. And so think about driving continued cost down to enable us to then continue and increase our investments in particular in support of these new products that are going after very large patient population. So, we are thinking about continuously driving our cost base to allow us to invest heavily in support of growth for the business. Bob Bradway : Skinner, as it\u2019s nearing 6 :30 on the East Coast, let\u2019s take two more questions, please. Operator : Absolutely. Our next question comes from Carter Gould from UBS Equities. Carter Gould : Good evening, guys. Thanks for the questions and squeezing me in. For Sean, follow-up in the earlier question given all the excitement, recently we have seen agents focused on inflammation go relatively broad in terms of indications that you are proceeding relatively narrowly despite central role in inflammation. Is that more because of the rest of your portfolio of assets, risk mitigation approach or should we expect the list of indications to expand? Sean Harper : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. I mean, what I would say is that we believe that there is a particularly profound level of unmet need in asthma and for a agent that could be given to sort of all comers without having to parse patients by fairly complex criteria that are difficult to assess in the average clinicians office. So, I personally believe that that is an area of particular opportunity for biologic therapy like tezepelumab. I think that COPD, it represents another very substantial opportunity and because of the nature of this mechanism one could believe that it might be more likely to have efficacy in a setting like that. Then some of the other therapies that are directed more at the inflammatory cascades that downstream in asthma and there are other disease areas like atopic dermatitis that we continue to explore. And I am sure as with all of these products in the inflammation space once a product has a kind of an anchor core profitable indication, virtually every good idea and a variety if not so good ideas get explored by either companies or investigator-sponsored studies trying to find every possible nook and cranny where the product might work. Operator : And our last question for the call comes from Kennen Mackay from RBC Capital Markets. Kennen Mackay : Hi, thanks for taking the question. One for Bob and David here. David, you mentioned there was now the balance sheet strength to really sort of grow the business and really supports some of that capital and Bob sort of building up what you mentioned surrounding a focus on transformative therapies like a moving micrometer like Aimovig, like Prolia, like Repatha, just wanted to get a perspective on what was out there that you really sort of view it as interesting? We have seen a lot of consolidation in the CAR T space, do you have some exposure there owning a couple of the Kite, now Gilead programs. Is there anything like in-gene therapy or gene editing or does that really not align with the positioning of sales and volume converging in the years ahead? David Meline : Yes, I guess, this is Meline. What I would comment on in terms of the opportunities out there we have been I think pretty clear that we are focused in particular on the six areas, where we have decided to establish a commercial presence. And so we tend to orient ourselves towards those opportunities and we are quite clear in the market that we want to see everything of any size that might be of interest to us across those areas and that Kennen maybe Sean would want to comment on technologies, but certainly\u2026. Sean Harper : Yes. No, I would just since you mentioned some of these emerging technology platforms like gene-editing for therapeutic purposes or gene therapy that the earlier these kind of things are, the more likely it is that we will look at them even if they aren\u2019t in one of these six areas, because we felt there is a breakthrough opportunity emerging and we could bring to bear our scientific and manufacturing commercial capabilities and so on. We have shown that will move on those kind of things. Bob Bradway : Alright. Well, I think Kennen, Sean and David did a good job answering the question, so rather than add to it, let me just again thank you all forbearance and call that went a little longer than usual from us. But just to wrap up, we are heading into 2018 as I think you can tell from our remarks. We are excited we think we are operating the business well. We have strong products. We have an attractive pipeline that\u2019s advancing rapidly. Strategically, we think we are well-positioned and focused on delivering growth and value for our shareholders. So, we look forward to reconvening with all of you in April and see how we do through the first quarter. Thank you. David Meline : And I would just like to add my gratitude for your patience. We had a lot of topics to cover today of course between myself and my team we\u2019ll be standing by for several hours. So, if you have any other questions, feel free to call us. Thanks again. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Okay. Thank you, Inn. Good afternoon everybody. I would like to welcome you to our conference call for the first quarter of 2018. I think we are off to a solid start with new and recently launched products continuing to deliver volume driven growth including our most recent launch of Parsabiv. We also have notable catalysts to look forward to, like our upcoming FDA action date for Aimovig for migraine prevention. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway will lead the discussion today with a strategic overview followed by our CFO, David Meline who will review our results for first quarter and provide updated guidance for 2018. Tony Hooper our Head of Global Commercial Operations, will dig into out product performance during the quarter, followed by our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. We will use slides corresponding to our prepared comments today and a link to these slides was sent earlier. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today\u2019s presentation to provide information, which maybe useful in understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today\u2019s press release, our Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website. So, just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements and our 2018, 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Mr. Bradway? Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Arvind. Thank you all for joining us. As you can see, we're off to a solid start in 2018 with 3% growth in product sales leading us to 10% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. We had double-digit unit growth in all of our new and recently launched products including Repatha, KYPROLIS, Prolia and XGEVA. We also generated strong volume growth outside of the U.S. where our legacy brands have faced competition for some time. Repatha, KYPROLIS, Prolia, XGEVA and soon Aimovig are clear examples of innovative medicines that address real unmet needs. These will be important drivers of our long-term growth. In addition, we continue to invest in R&D to develop new game changing medicines like omecamtiv, tezepelumab and in the earlier stage molecules like our IL-2 mutein all of which have clear potential value propositions for patients and society. In addition the broad promise of our BiTE platform is coming into focus across a number of molecules in our cancer pipeline. The recent approval for BLINCYTO in ALL patients with minimal residual disease gives us confidence in this approach to immuno-oncology for both liquid and solid tumors. We're looking forward to launching Aimovig, our first neuroscience therapeutic, which is in turn a first-in-class CGRP antibody for migraine prevention. Together, with Novartis we're ready to launch Aimovig this quarter in the U.S. We hope to redefine migraine prevention for relevant patients, physicians and payers given the urgent unmet need and the pent up demand for a better therapy in this disease. Current therapies do not adequately address this debilitating disease and migraine is gone under appreciated and under treated for too long. Later this year we will see our biosimilar effort begin to come to fruition as we launch AMGEVITA our biosimilar of Humira internationally. We have a compelling opportunity to leverage our decades of biotechnology experience to create and reliably supply high quality biosimilars to patients worldwide. While gaining regulatory approval of biosimilars has proven challenging for many in the field, we have successfully executed in our plans receiving first cycle approvals for AMGEVITA and MVASI a biosimilar to Avastin. We have our next opportunity for approval with KANJINTI our biosimilar version of Herceptin on May 28, in the U.S. We believe biosimilars can be an important growth opportunity for us as we begin to launch our products globally. Our balance sheet and after tax cash flows are strong enabling us to invest in long-term innovative growth opportunities and to return capital to our shareholders. Our priorities for the use of cash continue to be investment in innovation and supporting the launches of our growth products while continuing to build out our global presence. Following tax reform, we announced plans to build a new state-of-the-art next generation bio manufacturing facility in Rhode Island, which will result in the creation of many new highly skilled jobs. This new plant, which is the first of its kind in the United States will employ Amgen\u2019s proven next generation bio manufacturing capabilities and manufacture products for the U.S. and global markets. As for business development, we continue to look for innovative opportunities that are consistent with our areas of strategic focus while remaining disciplined about the path to earning return for our shareholders. We have a strong track record of returning capital to our shareholders, which we plan to maintain. Since initiating our dividend seven years ago, we have raised it on average 25% a year, while also returning excess capital through significant programmatic share buybacks like those, which we've undertaken this year. Briefly addressing the political environment, let me say that over the coming weeks and months, we will continue to work with Congress and the administration to advocate for policies that improve the affordability and access to important new medicines while seeking ways to constructively modernize Medicare program. In closing, let me just thank all of our Amgen staff around the world, as I look at our business today and into the future our outlook remains strong as we continue to deliver for patients and shareholders. Let me turn the call now to David. David Meline : Okay, thanks Bob. We're pleased with our solid revenue and earnings growth in the first quarter. As our transformation, efforts continue to enable investments in support of volume driven growth during a time of portfolio transition. Turning to the financial results, on Page 6, of the slide deck worldwide revenues at $5.6 billion in the first quarter grew 2% year-over-year. Worldwide products sales at $5.3 billion in the first quarter grew 3% year-over-year as strong unit demand for our new products outweighed declines in our mature brands. We are particularly, encouraged by our 11% year-over-year volume growth in Europe, reflecting the value of our innovative products in a market where we have experienced bio similar competition and portfolio transition for a number of years. Other revenues at $211 million decreased $54 million year-over-year due to an unfavorable compare related to milestone payments received in Q1 of 2017 partially offset by higher royalty income in Q1 of this year. Non-GAAP operating income at $3 billion grew 1% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 56.9% for the first quarter. As in prior years, our operating margin is expected to be lower in the remaining quarters of the year driven by the timing of expenses. As mentioned last quarter, we continue to evaluate incremental investments in our products and pipeline as well as external opportunities to drive growth and maximize shareholder value. On an non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of products sales improved by 0.4 points to 12.7% driven by lower royalty expense partially offset by increasing manufacturing costs. Research and development expenses at $739 million, were relatively unchanged in the first quarter of 2018 versus last year. Research and development as a percent of products sales at 13.8% is lower in Q1 consistent with previous years. Going forward, research and development expense as a percent of products sales is expected to normalize to around 2017 levels. SG&A expenses increased 6% on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by launch preparations for Aimovig and our bio similar products, In addition to making greater investments in Prolia to capitalize on its full potential. Similar to our R&D expense profile the SG&A percentage of sales is traditionally lowest in Q1 and we expect the full year to normalize at or above the 2017 levels as we continue to invest in our launch and growth products. In aggregate non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year, we remain on track to exceed our 2018 commitment of 1.5 billion in transformation savings, while investing those savings to launch and support new products, build out new therapeutic areas and advance our bio similar business increase our global presence and continue to provide meaningful returns to shareholders. Other income and expenses, were a net $182 million expense in Q1. This is unfavorable by $51 million, on a year-over-year basis. The non-GAAP tax rate was 13.7% for the quarter a 4.8 point decrease versus the first quarter of 2017. Reflecting the lower U.S. federal statutory rate due to tax reform. Non-GAAP net income increased 6%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 10% year-over-year for the first quarter to $3.47 per share. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Page 7. Free cast flow was $2.6 billion for the quarter driven by higher net income as expenses normalized for the remainder of the year we would expect free cash flow in subsequent quarters to be somewhat reduced from Q1 levels. In addition, earlier this month we paid $600 million, which represented the first of eight annual installments of the cash repatriation tax. This payment will impact our Q2 free cash flow. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders consistent with our commitments as we deployed $10.8 billion in Q1 to repurchase 56.4 million shares. We plan to repurchase an incremental two to four billion of our shares in Q2. Additionally our first quarter dividend increased to $1.32 per share, an increase of 15% over last year. Cash in investments totaled $32.2 billion, a decrease of approximately $6.2 billion from the first quarter of last year. This decrease reflects the successful execution of our Dutch auction tender offer in Q1 in addition to or significant buyback in dividend deployments over the past twelve months offset by our free cash flow generation during that same period. Our debt balance stands at $35.5 billion as of March 31, carrying a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% and an average maturity of 12 years. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2018 on Page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue to invest in our pipeline. Build out our global presence and increase spend in support of long term volume growth across large patient populations. Today, we are revising our 2018 guidance, which reflects our solid Q1 growth as well as the revised tax outlook. Overall, our revised revenue guidance is $21.9 billion to $22.8 billion versus previous guidance of $21.8 billion to $22.8 billion. This continues to reflect a range of potential Sensipar generic competition outcomes as well as new potential competition for Neulasta and Aranesp. At the same time contemplating the year-to-date sales performance for Calcimimetic portfolio. With regard to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we are revising the outlook to $12.80 and $13.70 versus a prior guidance of $12.60 to $13.70. Further, we are revising our non-GAAP tax rate guidance to 13.5% to 14.5% versus prior guidance of 14% to 15%, as we have realized some favorable one-time items in 2018 associated with the implementation of tax reform. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $750 million this year. This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony. Tony Hooper : Thank you, David and good afternoon everyone. You\u2019ll find our product sales starting on Slide number 10. Our business, continues to shift to more volume driven growth, as we continue to launch innovative products targeting large patient populations with unmet medical needs. We're off to a solid start to the year, with all of our newer products delivering double digit growth. The total portfolio grew at about 3% as the legacy brands, some of this volume growth. As has been trend for the last number of quarters our ex-U.S. business continues to grow more rapidly generating 7% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange fueled by 9% volume growth. In many of our ex-U.S. markets we've already experienced a majority of the decline of a mature brands demonstrating the growth potential of our newer portfolio. These markets serve as a model, for the overall company's future growth profile. We\u2019re also in deep preparation for the upcoming launches Aimovig for migraine sufferers and the first of our bio-similar portfolio. A majority of the sales teams are trained and in place and subsequent investment levels will continue ramping up throughout the year. Let me now turn to our brand performance. Prolia, leading brand osteoporosis therapy grew 16% year-over-year primarily from volume. We continue to drive growth of new patients, as well as improved repeat injection rates. This results in an increasing share of postmenopausal osteoporosis segment, as patients and physicians realize the benefits Prolia. As a reminder, given a six month dosing interval Prolia exhibits a seasonal sales pattern with quarter one and quarter three representing lower sales, than quarter two and four. Overall market penetration either is still low in the 20% indicating, significant potential for improved diagnosis and treatment. With this unique profile and through an increased investment we expect Prolia will remain a very strong growth driver. Let\u2019s now move to the oncology, starting with Kyprolis. Kyprolis grew 17% year-on-year driven primary by our ex-U.S. business. The majority of second line usage in Europe is in the triplets regimen and Kyprolis has continued to take market share from Velcade. In the U.S. the overall multiple myeloma market defined as all lines of treatment grew in the first quarter. Kyprolis has stable shape but room to growth in the second line segment. Our focus message to physicians remains clear. Patients who have relapsed will actually live longer than when treated with regimens that include Kyprolis. XGEVA grew 11% year-over-year primary from volume. Although we believe more than half of this growth is from a buy in that should burn off over the coming quarters. Since our label expansion into multiple myeloma in January 2018, our teams have been emphasizing XGEVA\u2019s clinical benefits of preventing skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma. It's still early days but anecdotally we are receiving positive feedback from physicians and institutions as many multiple myeloma patients cannot receive optimal therapy with [indiscernible]. Whilst we're not providing a slide let me comment on the other products on our oncology portfolio. The combined sales Nplate, to Vectibix, IMLYGIC and BLINCYTO exceeded $400 million in the quarter. Sales growth of these brands at 16%, 15%, 20% and 44% respectively was driven primarily by volume growth with some benefit from a buy up during the quarter. I'm particularly pleased by the performance of BLINCYTO, which is our first product in the BiTE platform. You'll hear more about this from Sean as well as his views on other products emerging from the platform. Turning now to Neulasta. Neulasta sales decreased 5% year-over-year as we continue to see a slight decline in the use of minor suppressant chemotherapeutic agents. We also saw a small blind little burn off in the second quarter. We continue to drive adoption of Onpro in the U.S. and exited quarter one at a 62% share. Onpro\u2019s utilization in the U.S. market further underscores the values of those patent protected technology and providing convenience for patients and lower rates of hospitalization due to febrile neutropenia. We expect to see more global utilization on Onpro in 2018. As a reminder we recently received positive CHMP Opinion for Onpro in Europe and are in the late stages of launch preparation in several markets. For NEUPOGEN, we continue to compete effectively holding just under 40% market share of the short acting market in the U.S., as we exit quarter one. This is after four plus years of facing competition. Moving now to Enbrel, sales declined 6% year-over-year with market growth and volume trends consistent with recent quarters. The stands in contrast to the trend break in market growth experience quarter one 2017. Recall that during quarter one patients experienced insurance re-verification and resetting of deductibles some of which resulted in a higher patient assistance class relative to late quarters \u2013 to latter quarters. Consistent with our pride disclosure we continue to expect 2018 net selling price to decline slightly versus 2017. While early days, the launch of ENBREL Mini with AutoTouch has been met with very positive feedback from both patients and customers and we\u2019re excited about this opportunity, this innovative, patient-centric delivery system provides. As a final note, purchasing patterns or the supply chain for ENBREL can cause quarterly fluctuations. As we noted previously, quarter one represents the lowest quarter of the year slightly over 20%, with the balance distributed fairly evenly through the rest of the year. Unit declines, net selling price trends for the balance of the year are expected to continue consistent with those seen in quarter one. Switching now to ESA portfolio. Slide number 18 shows the quarter one 2018 composition of our ESA business and provides a year-on-year growth percentage for the different segments. EPOGEN declined 10% year-on-year, underlying volume remains relatively stable, while we recognize a lower net selling price, as a result of our extended supply agreement with DaVita. Aranesp declined 11% year-over-year with lower unit demand of 8%, primarily based on increased competition. Recall that last quarter we provided a disclosure that a long-acting competitor had extended their product more broadly into the small to mid-size dialysis centers. And then we expect to lose some of those businesses early as quarter one 2018. We have volume and share based contacts with some of these customers and we'll continue to compete on an account by account basis. We're also prepared to compete for the potential short acting biosimilar in all customer segments including hospitals and oncology clinics, if and when such a biosimilar is approved by the FDA. Our long track record of safety, efficacy and reliable supply is a competitive advantage. Turning now to cosmetics, we've launched Parsabiv in several markets including the U.S. and is off to a strong start. As the head to head technical data showed, Parsabiv demonstrated a greater level of efficacy when compared to Sensipar. Since it\u2019s administered in the patients existing IV line during dialysis, it puts control in the hands of the health care provider, which could also drive an improved level of adherence, nephrologists continue to be positive and are excited about having this product available. In the U.S. so far we have a solid uptake in the midsized dialysis providers. The larger free-standing dialysis clinics continue to run pilots to determine the eventual treatment protocols. We expect to see adoption increase gradually over time. Turning now to Sensipar where year-over-year growth of 18%. As a reminder, the reimbursement mechanism for Sensipar in the U.S. changed from Part D to Part B in the beginning of 2018. It was also altered the supply chain for patients, most of whom now receive Sensipar directly from the dialysis provider versus more traditional pharmacies. We believe the providers ordered additional supply during quarter one in order to minimize potential patient treatment interruption. We also believe that the new supply chain is now normalized and quarterly volume should return to more historical run rates, assuming continued exclusivity and take into account some transition to Parsabiv. As David mentioned, the 2018 outlook for Sensipar is still somewhat uncertain given the ongoing litigation. It is of course conceivable that competitors may be able to bring generic products to market at some point in 2018, although, we believe we have a strong litigation position. With Repatha, we continue to compete effectively maintaining a majority share on a global basis, with outcomes data in our Repatha label. Our team has been speaking directly to the benefits of treating patients with Repatha and its ability to reduce the risk of heart attack by 27% and stroke by 21%. Repatha grew 151% year-over-year, primarily from volume. Overall fulfillment rates in U.S. continue to improve as utilization management criteria evolved. Over the past few months we've seen access to Repatha continue to be improved and we remain committed to ensuring access and affordability of high risk cardiovascular patients. We've been negotiating with several payers for months to expand patient access to Repatha and offering significant discounts with multiple offers spending. As a market leader, a majority of new PCSK9 inhibitor prescriptions offer Repatha. The only PCSK9 inhibitor approved by the FDA to prevent heart attacks and strokes in patients with established ASCV disease, in addition we have unequivocally demonstrated that treating patients to the lowest LDL level as possible is the best treatment approach including for patients with baseline LDL levels as low as 70 milligrams per deciliter. Our priority remains reaching the large population of high risk cardiovascular patients. The cost of society of not treating these patients in unacceptable and we look into all options to improve access for appropriate high risk patients, we also look forward to having the Repatha labels updated and expanded with the outcomes data outside the U.S. soon. Let me finish what I started, we continue to transition to a portfolio exemplified by volume-driven growth with performance in many countries outside the U.S. as proof point. A majority of our brands grew double-digit, our performance in our mature brands as well as some of the new ones demonstrate our ability to compete. This gives us confidence as we prepare for our upcoming launches. So let me close by thanking all the Amgen\u2019s staff that work so hard to get these important products to patients and for the strong start to 2018. Now I\u2019ll pass you to Sean. Sean Harper : Thanks Tony and good afternoon. I'll begin my comments today with a brief overview some key milestones from Q1 and then highlight a few early stage innovative programs we find particularly promising. We recently received several important regulatory decisions in Europe, including the approval of an expanded indication for XGEVA prevent skeletal related events in patients with multiple myeloma. We also received several positive opinions from the CHMP including recommendations for the addition of our cardiovascular outcomes data to the Repatha label. A Neulasta label variation to include the Onpro kit and a marketing authorization for KANJINTI, our biosimilar Herceptin, I would note that KANJINTI, has a PDUFA action date next month in the United States, also in the U.S. BLINCYTO received accelerated approval and orphan designation for the treatment of adults and children with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia with minimal residual disease or MRD. There are now technologies that allow for exquisite sensitivity in detecting at a molecular level whether residual disease are suppressant. MRD is the strongest prognostic factor for relapse in ALL patients and in our Phase 2 study of ALL patients in complete remission that were positive for MRD, 81% achieved MRD negativity after a single cycle of BLINCYTO. This was the first step for approval for the treatment of MRD by FDA and we're gratified that our first BiTE therapy is meaningfully advanced the oncology field. This approval presents a paradigm shift not only in the treatment of ALL but also potentially in other diseases were extremely potent therapies are being employed as such we're incorporating MRD into all of our clinical studies as appropriate. And we continue to develop therapies that drive deep and durable responses. For the first time, there is talk of actually achieving cures and what have been fatal diseases and we're excited to help lead the way. We have the opportunity to highlight preclinical data from several of our Phase 1 assets at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting early this month. The antiapoptotic family members MCL-1 and BCL-2 are understood to play a key roles in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia or AML, a grievous disease that affects four times as many people as ALL with approximately 20,000 new cases and 10,000 deaths per year in the United States alone. At AACR, we presented promising data showing market improvements in activity and potency with the combination of our MCL-1 inhibitor AMG 176 and the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax compared to either agent alone in preclinical settings. A Phase 1 study of AMG 176 as monotherapy is currently enrolling relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and AML patients. We also discussed our unique ability to target the antigen DLL3, very exciting target with both BiTE and CAR-T technologies, small cell lung cancer is an aggressive disease with very poor outcomes and accounts for about 10% to 15% of all lung cancers. Despite this, there have been no significant advances in the treatment of this devastating disease in decades. DLL3 expression is highly restricted to small cell lung cancer. And we've developed two very potent modalities for clinical testing. AMG 757 or half-life extended \u2013BiTE if its currently enrolling patients in Phase 1 and AMG 119 or DLL3 CAR-T developed with KITE that we expect to begin enrolling very soon. We're really anxious to see the effects of targeting DLL3 with immuno-oncology approaches which we believe will be more effective compared to a traditional antibody or antibody drug conjugate approach. We also presented preclinical data characterizing our half-life extended BCMA BiTE for multiple myeloma AMG 701 and our FLT3 CAR-T program for AML. At the Society of Interventional Radiology meeting in March, we presented Phase 1 safety data from our hepatic injection study of IMLYGIC. And we're now moving into Phase 2 in combination with KEYTRUDA in hepatocellular carcinoma and a number of tumor types with liver metastases. All of these programs underscore our differentiated multimodality approach to our immuno-oncology platform, where in addition to IMLYGIC, we're currently advancing more than a dozen early stage BiTE molecules, there are seven already in the clinic and three CAR-Ts through our collaboration with Kite. We're particularly interested in the potential for BiTE in solid tumors and we've been seeing some very encouraging early activity. We look forward to initial clinical data from AMG 420, our BCMA BiTE for multiple myeloma and AMG 330, our CD33 BiTE for AML by the end of this year. Briefly on Aimovig, our CGRP receptor antagonist antibody, we continue to work with the FDA toward our May 17th PDUFA action day and data are being presented today at the American Academy of Neurology from a study in patients with migraine who have previously failed two to four preventive treatments. These unique results add to the consistent body of evidence for Aimovig across the spectrum of migraine patients from treatment na\u00efve through those who have failed multiple therapies. Finally, I'd like to spend a few minutes on one of our early inflammation programs, AMG 592, an IL-2 mutein current therapies for auto immune diseases suppress the immune system. While this approach is effective in therapies such as Enbrel have changed the practice of medicine significant unmet need remains for many of these diseases. In a normally functioning immune system regulatory T cells or Tregs maintain balance between self and non-self recognition by negatively regulating effector cells. In the autoimmune disease state, this balances off favoring the effector cells within paired Treg responses having been identified in multiple human diseases including through human genetics. IL-2 is the dominant growth factor for Tregs but in its native form, it has significant toxicity associated with administration. With AMG 592, we\u2019ve designed an IL-2 mutein with an extended half life that preferentially binds to the IL-2 receptor. So as to selectively promote Treg growth and function, at last year's American Society of Hematology meeting, we presented in Phase 1a data in healthy volunteers that showed a single dose of AMG 592 was well tolerated and resulted in dose dependent increases in Tregs with minimal increases in effector cells as shown on Slide 30. Based on these exciting results, we've already initiated proof-of-concept studies in graft, chronic graft versus host disease, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. We\u2019re very excited about the potential for AMG 592 and believe that this approach could be quite powerful in a number of inflammatory diseases. In closing I want to thank our staff for their dedication to developing break-through medicines for the benefit of patients. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Sean. Inn, we turn over to our question time now and perhaps you could remind our callers of the procedure for asking question. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from line of Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham : Afternoon, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. Tony for Aimovig, I know we\u2019re close to the launch and I realize it\u2019s competitive. But maybe if you could help us with kind of how you see the size and scale of the commercial organization. And from a reimbursement perspective, maybe what are the lessons to be learned from the PCSK9 experience when you look to the migraine launch. Thank you. Tony Hooper : Geoff, let me try and answer it in two ways that we are going to market together with Novartis. Novartis have a rich history of presence in the neuroscience market, both in terms of the salesforce and an outstanding medical organization. We have complementing it with both teams calling on specialists as well as some of the primary care physicians who have a propensity to look after patients with severe headaches or migraines. From a timing perspective, we clearly are in the lead. We look forward to launching first unlike the PCSK9 situation. We had to follow. We will actually sit in the price of cells. And this is clearly a market where patients have huge symptoms and actually know when they\u2019re not being properly treated. So we look forward to a large dose of patients who want to come of this drug as quickly as possible. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Andrew Peters from Deutsche Bank. Maryana Breitman : Yes. Hi guys, thank you for taking the questions. Maryana Breitman for Andrew Peters. I wanted to ask about a possible strategic moves, do you see [indiscernible] like new platform or technical capability or an individual products and what stage products would those be? Bob Bradway : Well. I\u2019m afraid your phone line was breaking up. So we couldn\u2019t hear the question. Do you want to try to repeat that and then Inn, if we can\u2019t hear at this time maybe you can recycle her towards the bottom end of the call. Sorry, won\u2019t you try again, let see we can hear you. Maryana Breitman : Can you hear me now? Bob Bradway : Not great. Why don\u2019t we get you on a different line and ask our operator Inn to help you get back in the queue. Maryana Breitman : Okay, Thank you. Operator : All right. While recycle our back through, our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Bob I think previously on some of the prior calls, you referred to access capacity in the system. I was just wondering if you can update us on your latest thoughts there particularly in light of some of the consolidation we\u2019re seeing on the services side of the industry. Thanks a lot. Bob Bradway : Nothing new Terence. As I said in my remarks, we\u2019re continuing to look at ways to use our balance sheet to strengthen the business, continuing to look at ways to invest in innovation. So we\u2019ve made our \u2013 I think our points on that topic well known and I wouldn\u2019t say, there\u2019s been change over the course of last quarter. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Christopher Raymond from Piper Jaffray. Christopher Raymond : Hi, thanks guys. Just one question on Enbrel. We kind of struck Tony by your prepared comments. I know you talked about this last quarter that Q1 would represent, I think you said 20% of the annual number for full year 2018. Just doing the math I think that would infer Enbrel revenue of about $5.5 billion for the full year. And I know you guys don\u2019t want to give guidance at any more granular than you\u2019ve already given. But that numbers a lot bigger than consensus and what actually imply on up year-on-year number which would seem to be a reversal from what we saw 2016 to 2017. So I just want to if you could verify that, first of all, is that math is right. Maybe sort of talk about the driver there in terms of that trend reversal. Thanks. Tony Hooper : Yes. So let me confirm again that quarter one is normally a 30 low quarter, because of the need for re-verification, the need for the reset of deductibles. So patients pick up in the second quarter. We said last quarter that we expected this quarter to be about 20% of the total annual revenue and then probably landed up at \u2013 being at about 21%, almost 22% of what I expect the full year to be. So my number don\u2019t get as high as yours. Christopher Raymond : Got it, thank you. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang : Hi, Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering maybe Tony, can you comment on the recent ICER draft analysis on a cost benefit on Aimovig, and actually propose that wrench of the pricing. Would you actually take that into your consideration when you price Aimovig? Thanks. Tony Hooper : Ying, so a couple of things. One, it is a is a draft publication by ICER. They are requesting public comments up to an including, I think the 8 of May. So a number of organizations are busy commenting on that. It is the second publication, obviously, if you remember that that they has already been one publication, which took place on the 23 of March in the Journal of Medical Economics, authored by a number of headache specialists and economists, which laid out in very clear value range for this particular category. The ICER report doesn\u2019t seem to take into account things such as absenteeism and presenteeism, which we would argue is really an important thing to look at from both an employee perspective and an employer perspective. But all of these ranges for within a reasonable level that will be discussing with the payers. Operator : And our next question is from line of Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Alethia Young : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on AMG 592, just curious if there\u2019s any kind of particular preclinical work that suggests an opportunity favors maybe lupus, RA or GvHD? Or is it kind of still an open question. Is there also the possibility for less frequent dosing there? Sean Harper : So we \u2013 this is a half-life extended kind of a construct that we\u2019ve designed. And I think that we have some, of course we have preclinical models of these diseases. But I would say that when you\u2019re working with such a different mechanism than has ever been applied to autoimmune disease before. Our faith in the predictive nature of these animal models of diseases like lupus and RA and so on is modest. So we use all kinds of scientific reasoning and the animal models to guide us into kind of the initial set of experiments that we chose. But it\u2019s fair to say that like was the case when for example TNF inhibitors came available or IL-17 and so on. It\u2019s ultimately important screened through humans with these diseases to determine, whether the mechanism can be fruitful. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Kripa on for Robyn. Like you mentioned earlier, you\u2019re developing therapies in multiple modes such as BiTEs and CAR-Ts to target the same indications and you have a lot in the pipeline. I was just wondering if you can take us to your thought process on how you decide to target the same indication with two different modalities or how you decide to go in one direction versus the other. Sean Harper : Right. So it\u2019s a good question, I mean the first thing I would point out is that, at the moment moving into the clinic. We really just have a few CAR-Ts and we deliberately matched a couple of them with BiTEs so that we could actually, scientifically determine the pros and cons of these technologies. Because the data that exists today are very much apples and oranges in terms of the patient populations and the way that they\u2019ve been pre-conditioned for example before being treated with, let\u2019s say, CAR-T cell versus BLINCYTO, even when you get into diseases that are on the surface the same ALL for example or the various forms of CD19 positive lymphoma. So I don\u2019t want to give you the \u2013 you to get the impression that for lots and lots of our targets we have double programs. We have helpful that are designed specifically to, hopefully in humans give us some understanding of whether the benefit risk looks better for one these hyper technologies versus another. And so that\u2019s kind of an approach and we like to understand that in both hematologic and in solid tumor settings. Ultimately what will determine what we move forward with is, primarily in oncology is going to be efficacy, right with an acceptable amount of safety. And what we really don\u2019t know yet is whether you can get some generally similar kind of a clinical benefit from \u2013 for example, a bite intervention versus a CAR T, it would be hard to imagine that you would select the CAR T under those circumstances given a lots of consider practical, considerations cost to goods and thing in that sort. It\u2019s early days, I don\u2019t think anyone has ever really made these comparisons, there is a lot of speculation. And we\u2019re hoping to shed some actual light on these clinical questions. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners. Geoffrey Porges : Thanks very much for taking the questions. Sean, list on your milestone still romosozumab in both U.S. regulatory submission and European review. Could you give us some update on your expectations for the labeled indication and the sort of size of the addressable patient population for romosozumab now? Sean Harper : Sure. Yes, I think that with romo, we\u2019re at this point where we\u2019re well into a process of discovering the entire clinical data base experience with the molecule to make sure that we have every cardiovascular event that may have occurred in any of the trials and then run them through a new blinded adjudication process. Well that make sound easy, it\u2019s actually quite time consuming and requires coordination between us and another clinical center in this case Timmy. So that\u2019s underway and I think the results of that are going to be very important in determining where we end up with the product. Obviously the unmet need for this kind of anabolic product it\u2019s very strong. The compelling need for it, the efficacy was very favorable. And it\u2019s a short period of treatment one year, so I think that what we really need to understand is do we believe that there is actually a cardiovascular risk because as you know, Geoff, we have two studies they can\u2019t both be true, one of them says there\u2019s a risk the other one says no. So if we get some additional information from this reanalysis it could tip the scales in one direction or the other, we\u2019re just seeking the truth. And then whatever the truth is it will make its way into the label. So it\u2019s a little bit hard to know where that benefit risk will land and whether we\u2019ll be talking about a patient population that has a particularly significant level of unmet need and therefore it makes sense to use it in a context in which we actually believe there\u2019s a cardiovascular risk versus that the cardiovascular risk seems to be much less of a true phenomenon. And so that\u2019s the best I can do to characterize that at this moment. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael Yee : Hi. Thanks for the question. I have a question for Bob. I mean, I guess there was a large M&A deal in the space last week. But I guess more important big picture your view of the environment given that there has not been that many deals. Do you feel for Amgen it is more of a case of not finding things that are good fits or it\u2019s a price issue? I guess maybe you could talk about the overall dynamic when you are looking at all of these different biotech companies. Thanks so much. Bob Bradway : Again I think, we have a track record of being pretty disciplined. The way we evaluate targets, our focuses on being confident that we have a pathway for our shareholders to earn a return. But we\u2019re looking for ways to invest in our industry, we\u2019re interested in innovation that aligns well with our six therapeutic areas that we focus in. And opportunities that are consistent with our desired advance innovation globally. But I think Mike, historically the evolutions have been challenged in this sector. We see a little bit of adjustment taking place now. And we\u2019ll continue to be thoughtful in reviewing all the different opportunities. So we think can help us earn a return for our shareholders and help make a difference for patients. Operator : And our next question is from line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company. Eric Schmidt : Hey, congrats on a great start to 2018. Maybe a question for Tony on Repatha. Since the presentation of the ODYSSEY data have you seen any changes in market share or any change in your pricing discussions with payers? Thank you. Tony Hooper : Eric, we saw an increase in the NBRxs after the outcomes data came into Repatha\u2019s label. Since the ACC, we\u2019ve seen relatively little change in the marketplace to date. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. Bob, my question is there\u2019s been a lot investor feedback on a possible merger of equals like a transformative deal between Amgen and a big pharma name \u2013 a European pharma name in particular. How do you feel about a transformative M&A situation? Is that something you\u2019re open to philosophically or is the focus really more on Smith Biotech. Bob Bradway : Our focus somewhere is on finding opportunities to invest in innovation, again, we think we can make a difference innovation is focused in the areas that are important to us and opportunities that enable us to continue to expand our global footprint. So, I think speculation rises and falls through time at our industry. But our focus on those things has been consistent as has our determination to have a pathway to earn a return for our shareholders through our business development activities. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory Kasimov : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about CGRP and recognizing the competitive nature of this class. But with the article out this morning commenting on Express Scripts intention to push for lower list prices on the CGRP class to limit out of pocket cost borne by patients and implement a pay for performance type of model. Would you say this is consistent with the interactions you\u2019ve had with payers and maybe how you\u2019re thinking about different pricing models for this class following on the heels of some of the more unconventional pricing scheme as you\u2019ve implemented for PCSK9s. Thanks. Tony Hooper : So Cory let me start that one and I\u2019ll let Sean to talk about some of the differentiation between our product and the others that are trying to come to market. Clearly, we are in the lead as they said and coming to market first is important it allows us to set the baseline price. We look very carefully at the value based pricing has come forward. We\u2019ve listened to the affordability question in the marketplace with the ESI or looking at value based prices and look forward to them opening up access in those situations to allow \u2013 access to appropriate patients. And we will continue to come forward with prices that are responsible that take into account the co-pay requirements as best we can. We have a number of risk based contracts on the table with Repatha and we\u2019ve acquired to pay that talk to players about risk based complex with Aimovig. So let me ask Sean to talk a little about why we think this drug is actually very different to the others coming to markets. Sean Harper : Well, Tony I think that there\u2019s a number of things to just point to in terms of the advantage besides being first to market. I first of all, we are a receptor antagonist and that is still the case, we\u2019re the only receptor antagonist in the clinic and we chose that path for a number of reasons. But one of them was potency and so we seem to be the only product that doesn\u2019t require loading doses or intravenous administration, which can be quite an awkward thing for patients and providers in general. We recently developed the data and this is being presented today in this population and highly refractory patients who failed as many as four prior prophylactic therapies and the data looked really strong in that group. So that\u2019s a differentiated data set. And I think also remember that when physicians are dealing with patients and it is encratic either adverse reactions or lack of \u2013 or presence of efficacy they have to choose between different agents within a class. Generally speaking, a physician is if they started with for example one of the ligand sequestering antibodies going to another ligand sequestering antibody doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense compared to trying a receptor antagonist. So we hope that the receptor \u2013 us being the only receptor antagonists would result in more therapeutic sort of options for physicians who are trying to manage this very challenging condition. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Carter Gould from UBS Equities. Carter Gould : Afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess commercial question for Tony on XGEVA. Hoping to get a little bit more detail on the uptick in the quarter, if you could maybe provide some rough detail on the size of the buy end versus how much was driven by myeloma. And you provided some anecdotes from physicians\u2019 and institutions but maybe some commentary on how access is going into simplification. Thank you. Tony Hooper : Okay, Carter. So, it\u2019s a great indication to have to expand the label we estimate there\u2019s about one hundred thousand multiple myeloma patients in the U.S. that potentially could benefit from the product. Because it\u2019s a Part B product I don\u2019t see the prescriptions as tightly as I do with the Part D products. So we tend to look back about six to eight weeks in arrears. It is clear that there\u2019s a large number of patients who could benefit from this the feedback has been good. The buy end probably accounts for about $30 million in the quarter, which we expect to burn out quite quickly. But everything we\u2019ve heard to date has been positive. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask the question on Parsabiv if I could I understand the financial and sort of growth prospects for the next year or two while the product outside of the bundle. Maybe you could just talk to us about what happened in this product and how you think about it as potentially longer-term growth driver once it gets added into the bundle and what the scenarios are for that? Thank. Bob Bradway : That would be tough to calculate that. As you know the dapple will run for a minimum of two years CMS will do a full evaluation of the benefit of the drug. We\u2019ve looked at our head to head trial, we feel that was fairly beneficial from an efficacy perspective. We also believe because of the PPI we line administration during dialysis that adherence will improve. And by definition the real world situation will deliver a higher level of value to both the patients and the dialysis units. And therefore it\u2019s not an and all it\u2019s really evaluating the benefit the drug brings and then how that is calculated into the future bundle going forward post a dapple. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets. Kennen MacKay : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe another one for Tony. I was just wondering if you could elaborate, just what was going on with Aranesp surrounding the competition at some of the smaller providers. And then on the long-term guidance wondering if you\u2019re accounting for HIF prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitors in the coming years here. Thank you. Tony Hooper : Okay. So Aranesp, as you know, is bifurcated into a whole lot of pieces more than half of our business is outside the United States where the business continues to be fairly stable other than foreign exchange. Inside the U.S. it is divided between the dialysis nephrology business the hospital nephrology business and the oncology areas. Oncology has been declining for some time, so we see no change there. In the nephrology dialysis there has been a movement from a competitor a long acting competitor from FMC that has now moved into some of the IDOS and the MDOS and some of the decline you are seeing, we do have volume and shape contract with a few of these people and we will continue to fight account by account. And then on the nephrology hospital there\u2019s a strange compare versus first quarter 2017 which included a large clinical trial purchased from a competitor. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Ronny Gal : Hi everybody and thanks for squeezing me in. Tony I\u2019m afraid this is one as \u2013 around the PCSK9. As we think about the contracts you try to sign out with the payers. Are you guys looking for open access, are you looking to close the card with a single word, or is your competitor interested in doing that and you\u2019re following him. And second, you kind of mentioned the issue around how low this one needs to go with LDLC. And I was wondering if Sean can comment on the GEM article showing kind of like feeding off the benefit when you start a patient below 100 LDLC. Tony Hooper : So, I think we\u2019ve always said that we would always want to have a situation where the physician has a choice on behalf of the patient. So I would always advocate for having an open formerly. We do talk consistently about looking for ways and means to have access for this high risk patient population. There\u2019s about 3.4 million patients in the high risk population. We think a very, very small percentage a single digit penetration has been made in that population to date. And then I\u2019ll let Sean talk about the scientific discussion around lowering LDL. Sean Harper : Yes. So I\u2019m familiar with the GEM article that you were referring to that was just published it\u2019s a meta-analysis. I\u2019d point you to the accompanying editorial, which I thought was pretty good at outlining some of the likely confounding that occurred in that meta-analysis. The problem with these meta-analyses is when they go back in time 20 plus years and look at mortality. They\u2019re very confounded by the case fatality rates that occur when people are hospitalized in the studies or experienced heart attack and stroke for example. So if you go back to for example the 4S study or Western Scotland studies the case fatality rate for a heart attack back in those days was like 30%, now it\u2019s 4%. So you really end up with a very confounded analysis which says, well gee, when you start with a high LDL and you lower it kind of to a mid range you get this big benefit on mortality. Well that\u2019s just what they were doing back then because there were no statins. And so people came in at very high LDL levels and they got reduced. And nowadays they come in at much lower LDL levels and it\u2019s virtually impossible to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in mortality, which has not happened in them in a long time and with a lowering trials. So I think that it\u2019s very confounded, I think the editorial speaks to most of that and also just talks about shouldn\u2019t we pay attention to the biology in our understanding holistically about how these products work and the data that emerged from all the studies that have happened in this field whether they be with statins or products like ezetimibe or now the PCSK9 inhibitors. The overall clear picture is that no matter where your LDL starts if you lower it substantially in a patient who\u2019s at high risk, you\u2019re going to really going to get a very large risk reduction. It is true that if a patient starts at a high LDL they have a higher risk because LDLs are risk factors. So in absolute terms you get a little bit more benefit for treating patients who have higher LDLs. But the relative risk reduction appears to be consistent across trend and the highest quality data show a very clear picture of lower is better without any safety concern. So that\u2019s my comments on it. Tony Hooper : As of going past 6 :00 PM on the East Coast. Why don\u2019t we take two last questions after which Bob will make some closing comments. Operator : Certainly. Our next question is from the line of Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities. Salim Syed : Yes. Hi, great guys. Thanks for the question. I just had one on Repatha. So there\u2019s a ACC treatment guidelines some people are expected to come out this year at ACC Conference 2018 that\u2019s November I believe. Do you have that same view? And then how do you expect \u2013 when you expect to come out of that in terms of practical incremental revenue opportunity for Repatha, they lower the target LDL levels. Thank you. Bob Bradway : I just comment that I think you\u2019re right that this sort of general expectation is that they do around the EHA time frame and at this point one assumes that they\u2019re not going to be waiting around for another data set that I can think of to look at lowering land. So I think it\u2019s pretty likely that they\u2019ll come out. And I think that if you look at the pathway update that was done some months ago likely is kind of indicative directionally of where they\u2019re likely to go as the data has accumulated. Tony Hooper : And then from a revenue perspective, I would imagine it would be very difficult for payer to have utilization and management criteria that defer to the guidelines that are published by the HA and the ACC. Operator : And our next question is from James Birchenough from Wells Fargo Securities. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing us in again. This is Nick in for Jim. Just going back to CAR T can you comment on Amgen\u2019s investment in the space with respect to helping commercially ready as opposed to academic components such as access, clothes manufacturing systems? And then for solid tumors many of you to get success with CAR T you\u2019ll need to take a combination approach. Can you share that view? Thank you. Sean Harper : Well let me answer the second question first. I think that \u2013 I believe that in most disease settings with whether you\u2019re dealing with the CAR T or the buy specific T cell engaging type technology particularly in solid tumor settings but even in some settings such as lymphoma. People will hypothesize that there could be additive or synergistic effects between checkpoint inhibition and the use of piece kind of targeted antigene focused approach. So I think time will tell but you can expect to see many of these agents developed where in arm and in the clinical trial will be to combine the product with a checkpoint inhibitor in addition to looking at its activity alone. I hope that\u2019s answer that part of the question. And Tony I think there was a component of the question having to do with kind of the more of the commercial landscape. I mean, these are Phase I, these are \u2013 we\u2019re just getting ready to started enrolling the first patient in our first CAR T program in Phase 1. We\u2019re certainly working with Tony\u2019s organization but at this early stage at this point. Tony Hooper : And Nick I\u2019m not sure as well as you\u2019re referring to the manufacturing but anyway you can follow up with Arvind and his team who were here for a while. We didn\u2019t get to the full breadth of your question. Anyway let me just wrap up by thanking you all for joining the call. As you can see we\u2019re off to a good start here at the first quarter of 2018. We think we\u2019re in a strong position heading into the balance of the year. And we\u2019re feeling confident about the long-term outlook for growth of the company. So we look forward to joining with you again here after the second quarter. Thank you. Bob Bradway : Well thanks everybody. Thanks, Inn. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Amgen\u2019s first quarter 2018 financial results conference call. We thank you greatly for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : My name is Ian and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Second Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks, Ian. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the time to participate in our second quarter results conference call today. We realize it's a very busy day with a number of companies reporting but, unfortunately, we are going to add to your already long day as we have a lot to discuss today. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will open up the discussion today with an overview of our business, the environment we operate in and management succession. Our CFO, David Meline, will then review our financial results for the second quarter in some detail and provide updated guidance for 2018. Tony Hooper, who leads our Global Commercial Operations, will give you an update on how our products are performing, particularly those that have been launched recently. And then our Head of R&D, Sean Harper, will provide a pipeline update. We will use slides to guide our discussion today and a link to these slides was sent separately. My customary reminder that we will use non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. But before I do, I would like to sign a fun fact for the day. The crossword puzzle in The New York Times today, 30 down, the answer is Amgen. So, with that, Bob, over to you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay, Arvind. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. On today's call, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter performance, share some thoughts on the rapidly-changing U.S. healthcare environment and, of course, comment on the succession plans that we announced earlier today for two senior leaders you know very well, Sean Harper and Tony Hooper. First, our performance. Our second quarter results demonstrate that we continue to execute effectively on our long-term growth strategy, as we delivered 4% top-line growth and 17% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. An important part of our strategy is to increasingly focus on volume-driven growth, and our results reflect the progress that we're making on that objective. Unit volumes increased, in many cases by double-digits, for all our newer products, including Repatha, KYPROLIS, Prolia and XGEVA. We also continue to generate strong volume-driven growth outside the U.S., where our legacy brands have faced competition now for many years. This includes 9% growth in the second quarter. We remain confident that our newer product launches, as well as the medicines advancing through our pipeline, will enable us to drive attractive, volume-driven growth globally over the long-term. Let me give you a few examples of some of the newer medicines that we're seeing driving our growth. In the second quarter, we launched Aimovig in the U.S., where it is the first and only CGRP inhibitor approved for migraine prevention. Aimovig also marks Amgen's first entry into a new therapeutic area for us, which is neuroscience. We've been very encouraged by the enthusiastic reception for Aimovig from physicians and especially from migraine patients who have waited a long time for a new treatment option like this. We're also encouraged by the progress we're making with Repatha which we believe can play an important role in the fight against cardiovascular disease, the world's number one killer. As you know, Repatha significantly lowers LDL cholesterol, which is a leading, modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We have and will continue to work to expand access to Repatha globally. Building on our decades of leadership in nephrology, we're seeing strong early adoption of Parsabiv, which is the first new treatment in more than a decade for secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on hemodialysis. And, lastly, I'm pleased to report that we recently launched our first biosimilar, KANJINTI, which is a biosimilar to Herceptin in Europe. We've put a strategic stake in the ground a few years ago to build a world-class biosimilars business, and we continue to believe that biosimilars represent a meaningful growth opportunity for us. We look forward to launching AMGEVITA, which is our biosimilar to Humira internationally later this year, and to launching a steady stream of biosimilars in the years to come. My comments on biosimilars provide a good transition to a discussion of the healthcare environment in the U.S. As you know, just this past week, the FDA published its Biosimilar Action Plan. We're encouraged by the FDA's actions as well as by others in the Trump administration, and we welcome the opportunity for open dialog. Although we believe biosimilars can help address the issue of rising healthcare costs in general and concerns over drug pricing in particular, we also recognize that biosimilars alone aren't enough. Fundamentally, we believe that innovation is the key to alleviating the massive financial burden placed on society by chronic diseases like cancer, neurologic disorders and cardiovascular disease. And without innovation and improved access to it, the burden of chronic disease, which already runs into the hundreds of billions of dollars annually for any single one of these diseases, will only grow larger as the population ages. And we'll continue to work with our colleagues in the industry to engage with the administration, Congress and the entire healthcare community to find ways to promote innovation, while also ensuring that our medicines are accessible and affordable for the patients who need them. We appreciate the administration's engagement on this important issue. And as to prices, we made decision a few months ago not to increase the prices of any of our medicines at midyear, and we have no plans to change that for the balance of the year. My final order of business before I turn the call over to David Meline is to discuss the executive succession announcements that we issued today. One of the hallmarks of a well-run company is the carefully considered succession planning process, and I believe that Amgen has done this well through our nearly 40-year history. And I'm confident we'll do so again as Sean Harper and Tony Hooper step-down from their roles in anticipation of their forthcoming retirements. I can't express strongly enough my deep appreciation for the contributions these two leaders have made to Amgen. They've played a critical role in transforming Amgen into the company we are today and their legacies will continue in the teams they've built and the patients that we'll serve. And above all, Sean and Tony have maintained a relentless focus on Amgen's mission to serve patients and we're a better company for it. As you all know, I have great respect and admiration for Sean and Tony and they've been great partners and colleagues. And while they leave big shoes to fill, I'm excited about the two leaders who are succeeding them and I know Sean and Tony are committed to working with me and my team to ensure that our new leaders successfully transition into their roles. Now, let me start with Dave Reese, who is known to many of you and is someone that I've worked closely with over the past decade. Dave has been with Amgen since 2005 and he's been closely involved with virtually all of the medicines that have emerged from our pipeline since then. An oncologist by training, Dave has led discovery research and parts of clinical development and he's also played a critical role in building our early-stage oncology pipeline, particularly our portfolio of BiTE molecules which we find especially promising. His background includes past faculty appointments at UCLA and UCSF, and we're excited to have him assuming the new responsibilities here at Amgen today. Dave has joined us on the call and he'll have an opportunity to say a few words a little later this afternoon. Meanwhile, Tony's successor, Murdo Gordon, will be joining us in September from Bristol-Myers Squibb, where he most recently served as Chief Commercial Officer. His experience and capabilities are a perfect fit for where we are going strategically. Murdo has global experience at a time when we're looking to continue to expand our geographic presence. He's operated in a number of our core therapeutic areas of focus, including cardiovascular disease, neuroscience, inflammation and oncology. And in addition, during his time at Bristol, Murdo led Commercial Operations in the U.S., which, as you know, is our largest market, and also had responsibility for value and access, which as I discussed earlier is an increasingly important component of today's dynamic healthcare environment. Tony will be at his role through much of the third quarter and he'll join us in welcoming Murdo on this earnings call in October. I'm looking forward to having Murdo and Dave become part of our leadership team and both are exceptional, highly accomplished leaders well-suited for the opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn to David Meline for financial highlights. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Bob. Overall, we're pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter as investments in support of our newer products delivered growth and our business continued to generate strong cash flow. Turning to the financial results on page 6 of the slide deck, worldwide revenues at $6.1 billion in the second quarter grew 4% year-over-year. Worldwide product sales at $5.7 billion in the second quarter grew 2% year-over-year as strong unit demand from our newer products outpaced declines in our mature brands. We're also encouraged by the sustained double-digit volume growth from our ex-U.S. markets. Other revenues at $380 million increased $144 million year-over-year due to a milestone payment received related to our Aimovig partnership with Novartis. Non-GAAP operating income at $3.1 billion grew 2% from prior-year. Non-GAAP operating margin at 55.1% for the quarter. As in prior years, our operating margin is expected to be lower in the remaining quarters of the year driven by the timing of expenses. As mentioned last quarter, we continued to evaluate incremental investments in our products and pipeline as well as external opportunities to drive growth and maximize shareholder value. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased by 0.4 points to 13.1%, driven by higher manufacturing cost and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by lower royalty revenue \u2013 expense. Research and development expenses at $850 million or 15% of product sales were relatively unchanged in the second quarter of 2018 versus last year. For the full year, we expect research and development expense as a percent of product sales to be comparable to 2017 levels. SG&A expenses increased 14% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by investments in product launches and marketed product support. We expect Q3 and Q4 spend levels to be consistent with Q2 as we continue to invest in our launch and growth products. In aggregate, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 7% year-over-year. Other income and expenses were a net $185 million expense in Q2. This is unfavorable by $29 million on a year-over-year basis. The non-GAAP tax rate was 14.2% for the quarter, a 3.2 point decrease versus the second quarter of 2017, due to the impacts of U.S. corporate tax reform, offset partially by a prior-year benefit associated with the effective settlement of certain state and federal tax matters. Non-GAAP net income increased 5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 17% year-over-year for the second quarter to $3.83 a share. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 7. The company generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow in the second quarter of 2018 versus $2.1 billion in the second quarter of 2017, driven by higher cash taxes resulting from the first installment of the repatriation tax paid in Q2 of 2018, partially offset by lower ongoing income tax liability as well as higher net income. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders, consistent with our commitment to deploy excess cash over time. In Q2, we deployed $3.2 billion to repurchase 18.2 million shares at an average of $175 per share. Further, we plan to deploy an incremental $3 billion to $5 billion for share repurchase in the second half of 2018. Lastly, our second quarter dividend increased to $1.32 per share, an increase of 15% over last year. Cash and investments totaled $29.4 billion, a decrease of $10 billion from the second quarter of last year. This decrease over the last 12 months was primarily driven by $19 billion of cash returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, partially offset by over $10 billion of free cash flow generated in the same period. Our debt balance stands at $34.5 billion as of June 30, carrying a weighted-average interest rate of 3.9% and an average maturity of 11.7 years. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2018 on page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue investing in our pipeline, building out our global presence and increasing spend in support of long-term volume growth across large patient populations, while delivering solid business performance. Today, we are revising our 2018 guidance, which reflects our strong Q2 performance and outlook for the second half of the year. Our latest revenue guidance is $22.5 billion to $23.2 billion versus prior guidance of $21.9 billion to $22.8 billion. This guidance reflects our solid performance to-date as well as our confidence of continued good performance while recognizing uncertainties related to potential new competition for Neulasta and Aranesp and a range of potential Sensipar generic competition outcomes. With regard to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we are revising the outlook to $13.30 to $14 per share versus previous guidance of $12.80 to $13.70 per share. We are reaffirming our prior non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 13.5% to 14.5%. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $750 million this year. In this regard, we are breaking ground on our new manufacturing facility in Rhode Island in the next week. This concludes the financial update. I turn the call over now to Tony. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Thank you very much, David, and good afternoon, folks. You'll find our product sales starting on slide number 10. I'm also pleased to report we delivered a solid second quarter, with 2% year-over-year product sales growth. Let me first add to Bob and David's comments regarding our focus on volume-driven growth. We recognized early on that the evolving U.S. landscape should lead us to focus investments in brands that serve large patient populations in addition to our traditional focus on more targeted specialized therapies. We also made the strategic decision to advance and bring to market a broad biosimilar portfolio. We're making good progress on all these fronts. As evidence, you can see our strong growth in Prolia and Repatha and our early success with Aimovig, three medicines that treat diseases affecting tens of millions around the world. We're also now in the market with our first biosimilar with several more to follow. In addition, our continued volume growth outside the U.S. serves as a model for what growth in the U.S. can look like in the future. With regard to U.S. pricing, in evaluating factors contributing to our reported sales growth, changes in net selling price had minimal to no impact over the last 18 months, and we expect that trend to continue going forward. We've not increased the list prices of any of our medicines since the administration's drug pricing blueprint was issued. And in May, we decided not to execute list price increases that have been planned for July. This reflects our commitment to identifying opportunities to improve affordability and access for patients. While there is no simple fixes, we want to be part of the solution. To summarize our sales performance for the quarter, we continued to generate double-digit growth, primarily driven by volume for several of our newer products and those with label expansions such as KYPROLIS, XGEVA, BLINCYTO and Parsabiv. And, once again, sales growth outside the U.S. was very strong, increasing by 9% excluding the impact of foreign exchange, driven by 14% volume growth. Let me now turn to our brands. Prolia delivered another outstanding quarter, with sales increasing 21%, with 16% volume growth year-over-year and share gains in both the U.S. and international markets. Moving now to oncology, let me start with KYPROLIS. KYPROLIS grew 25% year-on-year, driven primarily by our ex-U.S. business. Our European business benefited this quarter from a $27 million clinical trial purchase. Just recently, we received approval to include overall survival data from the ASPIRE study to both the U.S. and EU labels. I'm also pleased to announce that we recently received reimbursement for KYPROLIS in France and we look forward to a rapid uptake in that country. XGEVA grew 14% year-over-year, primarily from volume, as we expanded into multiple myeloma with our label update this January. Turning now to Neulasta where sales increased 1% year-over-year, but consistent with recent trends we saw slight reduction in the overall market segment in the second quarter, resulting in a small decline in volume. We continue to drive the adoption of Onpro in the U.S. and exited quarter two at 63% share of Neulasta unit sales. Onpro's increased utilization underscores the value it provides to patients and providers, which we believe will be a clear differentiator versus potential competition. We expect to see more global utilization of Onpro in 2018, with recent launches in Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Poland, Ireland and Austria. Regarding potential new entrants, we are prepared to compete if and when they enter the market and have years of experience competing in the short-acting G-CSF market across the globe as well as experience competing in select markets outside the U.S. in the long-acting GCF market. We're confident in our capabilities, and we know that reliability of quality supply is a key factor for our customers. For NEUPOGEN, we exited the second quarter holding 37% of the short-acting segment in the U.S. Some of our competitors and public officials have made statements that the U.S. biosimilar market is not working. We have a different point of view. NEUPOGEN was the first major biologic to face biosimilar competition in the U.S. The fact that our biosimilar now holds the majority share of this segment less than three years post-launch proves that biosimilars can find a meaningful place in the U.S. market just as they have in Europe. This also gives us confidence in the future of the Amgen biosimilar portfolio. With respect to remainder of our oncology portfolio, the combined sales of Nplate, Vectibix, IMLYGIC and BLINCYTO were $426 million in the quarter, representing 10% year-on-year growth with 11% coming from volume increases. Enbrel sales declined 11% year-over-year with market growth, segment share and net selling price constant with recent trends. You'll recall that second quarter 2017 benefited from a significant inventory build creating an unfavorable year-over-year comparison. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, sales increased 18%. We continue to be pleased with the launch of Enbrel Mini with AutoTouch which has been met with positive feedback from both patients and physicians. Overall, we expect fundamental drivers of Enbrel to follow the recent trends. Switching now to our ESA portfolio, EPOGEN declined 14% year-over-year due to competition and a lower net selling price driven by extended supply agreements with DaVita. Aranesp declined 12% year-over-year, primarily driven by increased competition. We've been competing against a long-acting product in the independent and midsize dialysis organizations since the beginning of the year. We have volume and share-based contracts in place with some of these customers and we'll continue to compete on an account-by-account basis. We're also prepared to compete with the recently approved short-acting biosimilar in all customer segments, including hospitals and clinics. Nonetheless, we expect to lose some share in these segments once the product is available. Let's now turn to our calcimimetics. Parsabiv has launched in several markets, including the U.S., where we have a solid uptake at the independent and mid-sized dialysis providers. Both FMC and DaVita continue to run pilots to determine the eventual treatment protocols. So looking ahead, we expect to see adoption continue to increase gradually over time. Turning to Sensipar, sales declined 2% year-over-year with the launch of Parsabiv. As David mentioned, the 2018 outlook for Sensipar is still uncertain given the ongoing litigation. It remains possible that a generic competition may enter the market later this year. Repatha sales grew 78% year-over-year, primarily from volume, as we continue to compete effectively, maintaining a majority share on a global basis. With outcomes data added to our label in the U.S. in December and more recently in Europe and Japan, our teams have been speaking directly to the benefits of treating patients with Repatha. We've recently concluded negotiations to improve patient access in the U.S. with several payers, including, but not limited to, CVS and Anthem. These payers presently represent greater than 65% of Repatha's commercial revenue. As these changes take effect in the second-half of this year, we expect the proportion of commercial plans requiring documentation and the utilization management criteria to be cut in half with the rest relying on simple physician attestation. In exchange for simpler, UM criteria, we have increased our rebates which will result in a lower net price. We recognize that the higher rebates unfortunately don't always result in lower out-of-pocket cost for patients. Therefore, we continue to work with a wide range of stakeholders on continued improvement in access. We are, however, encouraged by the fact that physicians have consistently recognized the benefit of treating patients with Repatha and have demonstrated a strong demand for the drug even when faced with severe restrictions on reimbursement. Our priority remains reaching the large population of high-risk cardiovascular patients. Now on to Aimovig, the first and only therapy specifically designed to prevent migraine by targeting and blocking the CGRP receptor. Patients and physicians share our excitement for this new therapy. And, as you know, we set up a hub to assist patients to gain early access to the product while we complete negotiations with payers. This program provides a free two-month trial of Aimovig. We have, in fact, received a large bolus of requests from the Headache Centers of Excellence reflecting the pent-up demand for this innovative new therapy. We're busy working through these requests and expect to see the prescriptions coming through over the coming weeks. Should a patient not be approved by the insurance during this two-month period, we have a bridging program during their negotiations to ensure that patients are not denied drug. Negotiations with payers are progressing well and we have successfully completed contracts to attain coverage for just under 30% of lives already. We're also excited that we've launched our first biosimilar, KANJINTI, a biosimilar version of Herceptin in Europe. Biosimilars represent an important growth driver for Amgen and so far the market is behaving as we anticipated. So, in closing, we continue to transition our portfolio, exemplified by volume-driven growth. I'm pleased with the execution and the consistency of performance in 2018. I'm excited about the opportunities in front of us. Let me close by thanking all the Amgen staff that work so hard to get these important products to patients and for a strong first half of 2018. Let me now hand you over to Sean. Sean? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, all. I'll begin today with our neuroscience collaboration with Novartis. Tony spoke about our U.S. launch of Aimovig and the difference it's already making for migraine patients. In addition to the U.S. approval in May, our partnership announced a CHMP positive opinion in the EU last month. And I'm pleased to announce that we recently submitted a Supplemental Biologic License Application in the United States for our 140 milligram SureClick autoinjector. We look forward to working closely with FDA to make this available to patients as soon as possible. Also, in migraine, we expect the data from our proof-of-concept in dose-finding Phase 2 study of our PAC1 antibody for migraine prevention, AMG 301, to be available by the end of the year and presentation at a medical meeting in 2019. There have been a number of recent developments in Alzheimer's disease clinical programs in our industry, so I thought it would be useful to highlight our partnership's ongoing beta secretase inhibitor program and why we have such confidence in our approach. AMG 520 or CNP520 is a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of BACE1, a target with strong genetic human validation from deCODE that is part of our neuroscience collaboration with Novartis. We're taking a differentiated approach with this clinical program and are currently enrolling two Phase 3 studies. In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid precursor protein cleavage products such as Abeta begin accumulating decades before symptoms present. And by the time a patient is symptomatic, Abeta accumulation has reached a plateau and significant neurodegeneration and subsequent inflammation have already occurred. Therefore, we've always felt that potential treatments should be administered as early as is feasible in trials attempting to demonstrate disease modification. So our partnership in collaboration with the Banner Institute (sic) [Alzheimer's Institute] (00:29:16) is focused on a population of pre-symptomatic cognitively normal subjects who based on their APOE genotype and age are very highly predisposed to developing cognitive impairment. One study is enrolling approximately 1,300 APOE4 homozygotes, that is subjects with two copies of the APOE4 risk allele and a second study is enrolling approximately 2,000 subjects, either APOE4 homozygotes or heterozygotes which have one APOE risk allele and evidence of brain amyloid accumulation. While we're studying a genetically defined population, it's a large and representative one, as approximately 60% of patients who develop Alzheimer's disease have at least one of these predisposing disease alleles. We haven't been surprised by how the Alzheimer's clinical landscape has played out of late and the recent disappointments and potential signals of efficacy have not changed our overall conviction around our program, particularly that a small molecule BACE1 inhibitor administered pre-symptomatically is likely to be the best approach to address this pathway and disease. In oncology, I'm happy to report we've completed enrollment in two Phase 3 studies, our study of KYPROLIS plus DARZALEX and dexamethasone versus KYPROLIS and dexamethasone alone in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and our IMLYGIC combination study with KEYTRUDA in unresectable metastatic melanoma. Turning to our early-stage oncology pipeline, we've advanced a number of programs into clinical testing as reflected on slide 26. And by the end of this year, we expect initial Phase 1 data from our BCMA BiTE, AMG 420, in multiple myeloma and our CD33 BiTE, AMG 330, in AML. We look forward to additional data from other BiTE programs over the next year or two, including both liquid and solid tumors. We've also deprioritized AMG 224, our BCMA antibody-drug conjugate, based on early data reads from our AMG 224 and AMG 420 programs that support our view that our BiTE technology may be superior to current ADC technologies. Finally, on Nplate, we recently submitted an application in the U.S. for pediatric immune thrombocytopenia. In other regulatory news beyond the KYPROLIS update that Tony discussed, we received a Repatha label update incorporating our cardiovascular outcomes data and full approval for BLINCYTO in the EU and Prolia was approved for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in both the U.S. and EU. Also, in our bone franchise, we resubmitted our EVENITY Biologics License Application for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture. Finally, in our biosimilars development programs, in addition to our KANJINTI approval that Tony discussed, we received Phase 3 data from ABP 710, our biosimilar of Remicade in rheumatoid arthritis, that we believe demonstrates similarity to a referenced product. In closing, as always, I'd like to thank our staff for continuing to deliver for patients. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Sean. Before we turn the call over to Q&A, Sean, if you'd like to say a few words as I guess this is your swan song earnings call. Why don't you feel free to share your thoughts? And then we'll invite Dave Reese to say a few words and then open up for questions. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Right. Well, this was, of course, an exceedingly difficult life decision for me given the wonderful experience I've had over more than 16 years at Amgen. I love the mission, the people, the science and technology, and all of these are the best they've ever been, not to mention the relationships I have based on mutual trust and respect with you, Bob, and many other Amgen leaders and staff. That said, it's rare in our industry to have the opportunity to personally hire from academia and develop over more than a dozen years such a capable individual as David Reese as a successor for Head of R&D. As you all know, succession for this particular role can be very challenging. Dave is truly ready and just, as importantly, after 21 years in the industry, I'm ready for a change, likely to early biotech company creation here in this local area of California. Dave is a medical oncologist who was on faculty at UCLA, when I recruited him to Amgen and he served in a variety of increasingly senior roles since his hire in 2005. These have included late-stage clinical development, discovery research and as our Head of Translational Sciences and oncology programs. In this last role, he's introduced all of our current pipelines into the \u2013 molecules into the clinic. Many of you know Dave from his presence in our investor events. If not, you're going to really enjoy getting to know him. He has my full confidence and that of my team as the next Head of R&D for Amgen. I'll be staying around through the end of the year to ensure a smooth transition. Finally, I'd like to thank everyone at Amgen and in the investment community for the support I've received over the years. It's been a privilege to be part of the evolution of this great American company and to have such high-quality interactions with our investors and analysts. Dave, welcome to earnings call-land. Why don't you make a few comments? David M. Reese - Amgen, Inc.: Well, thank you, Sean, and thank you for your partnership. It's certainly been a highlight of my career over the last 13 years. I'd like to emphasize that we're dedicated to our core mission of advancing science for the benefit of patients. We'll continue to focus on developing medicines that produce large effect sizes in serious diseases where there is significant unmet medical need. I've been a part of the R&D leadership team for some time as Sean mentioned. And I also believe that the commitment that we've made to using human genetics to understand the origins of disease and to suggest therapeutic interventions is the right choice and in fact will become increasingly important in our drug discovery enterprise. Likewise, I'm convinced the platforms such as our BiTE technology, and other therapeutic modalities have the potential to deliver transformative medicines. Having led our Translational Sciences efforts for some time, I cannot be more excited about our preclinical and clinical pipelines. At the same time, it's undeniable that we've entered a period of remarkable technological ferment leading to both a deeper understanding of disease, and providing a wide array of new technologies that will change how we do science at the bench and advance molecules in the clinic. In light of this, I'm extraordinarily enthusiastic about the opportunities in front of us and I look forward to keeping Amgen at the forefront of this rapidly-changing industry. I also very much look forward to working with all of you in the investment community as we focus on creating value through delivering our pipeline. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Dave. Let's open it up for questions now and we'll ask our operator just to remind you all of the procedures for doing that. Ian, over to you. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter and congrats to both, Tony and Sean. So first one I have a high level question. You guys bought back $3.2 billion stock in second quarter in addition to the $10 billion buyback in first quarter. And then there's another plan to do a $3 billion to $5 billion in second half. Does this suggest anything about your strategic thinking about M&A transactions, given the large buyback? And then, secondly, maybe I want to see if you have any comments on the potential entry of Neulasta biosimilar in the second half. We saw Mylan priced at 33% discount on list price level. So what's the assumption on the second half run rate for Neulasta? And what's your defense strategy on Neulasta? Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. There's quite a lot there, Ying. Let's break it into two-parts. Start with David Meline in response to your question on capital allocation. Then we'll ask Tony just to reiterate what he said in the call. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah. So on capital allocation, I think, we've been quite clear in the past and we haven't changed our point of view, which is how we create value as an enterprise is investing in innovative medicines either internally through our own R&D efforts and also we're very active looking for opportunities externally to add to the portfolio. And so we'll continue to do that. What's also true is I think we all know we have a tremendous capability for cash generation, and we have a large amount of excess cash following tax reform. And we are committed to return excess cash through time to shareholders. So I wouldn't read our ongoing repurchase activities to be anything other than following on that commitment and I would definitely not read that we're backing off from our commitment to continue to add to our pipeline and our portfolio. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So as regards the Neulasta biosimilar, I mean clearly we have been competing in the marketplace with NEUPOGEN and biosimilars for a number of years now. The team stands ready and able to compete. We have a long legacy and history of reliable and consistency of quality supply. We have spent quite a bit of time converting the market to the Onpro device, which is a unique and innovative device which is beneficial for both clinical practice and for patients themselves. And I think there's quite a difference in the marketplace between the list price of these drugs and the ASP price. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Let's go to the next question. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC : Thanks for the question. And I guess, Sean, this might be your last call so I wanted to ask you a question. And that was you highlighted Alzheimer's and perhaps you could opine, obviously, on your view since you are running different studies in APOE carriers and non-carriers, whether there is truly a difference there and whether there's a difference in progression and opine on the debate, of course, this week. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Well, Michael, I think that we've been able to utilize data that we've accumulated in Iceland through deCODE who, as you know, have done some of the really seminal breakthrough genetics and epidemiology and in Alzheimer's to understand the rate of cognitive decline that occurs in patients who have 01 or 2 of the APOE4 alleles. And that plus age allows one to make some estimates of when people who are cognitively normal will begin to develop some cognitive impairment in the context of a disease-modifying trial. So we've had the advantage of that information, and that's what led us with Novartis to move toward this kind of a genetic stratification of the population. And we again expect because we are looking at this type of enriched population that we'll be able to conduct in a feasible way these trials which otherwise it would be very difficult to conduct if you were taking patients who were cognitively normal and didn't have these high risks for conversion in the reasonably near future, try to engage in a clinical trial. So it is a differentiated approach and I think an important one. And as I stressed before, it's not like a little proof-of-concept experiment in some tiny subset of patients with a genetic risk factor. This is 60% of the people who present with Alzheimer's disease have one or two APOE risk alleles. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Thank you. Next question? Operator : And our next question is from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So before my question let me say congratulations to Sean and Tony on their tenure and good luck as they move on and welcome to Dave. So, Tony, I was hoping a question for you. You mentioned a little bit about Aimovig. I was hoping if you could provide some insight into two factors. So we're obviously seeing the scripts but we don't really have a good idea of the translation of those scripts for free drug into revenue. So I don't know if you're willing to just give us any thoughts around how we should be thinking about the script trajectory versus your ability to generate revenue from them. And then second item is you talked about having about 30% of the lives with coverage already. Could you just talk a little bit about what's the utilization management criteria that you've been able to negotiate for that? And do you think that's suggestive of the UM that we should expect for the rest of the plan? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Sure, Matthew. So I want to start by saying I think from what I've seen anecdotally from both physicians and from patients, the response to Aimovig in the marketplace is beyond our expectations, right. So patients are really finding this to be a definitive difference in the way of managing their migraines. We knew we'd have a little bit of an issue in the beginning as we sort of put the contracts into place. So we created the hub together with Novartis to ensure all patients referred into the hub first to allow them access if they didn't already have coverage to the two-month free program. Right now, the majority of our business is in free drug, but we are rapidly converting that business to paid prescriptions. And you'll see as the bolus comes through the hub, there's been quite a dramatic change in the number of patients that happened in the last week or so. And we expect this to get back to a steady state in the next three or four weeks or so. In terms of those organizations who were visionary enough to move rapidly to give access to patients who have been struggling with this devastating disease for a long time, the UM criteria has been pretty clear. We always assume the drug will be used as a second line when patients have failed on existing generic therapies and that's where it is, but all the plans at the moment only require physician at a station, right? So, no documentation, just a physician stating very clearly the patient has already tried some other products. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Thank you. Let's go to the next question. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray. Christopher J. Raymond - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks. Got a question on co-pay accumulators. So I think last quarter, Tony, I think you indicated that you don't anticipate seeing any impact in the first half but we're now in the thick of Q3 and from most modeling of these types of plans it looks like much of the impact is likely to be in the summer. So I guess maybe can you describe \u2013 and also, one of your big competitors actually lowered guidance for one of their drugs as a result of impact here. Can you maybe just talk about the dynamic impacting Enbrel in particular? And I know there's a few countermeasures that you and other folks in the industry have talked about taking but maybe give an update as to how effective those countermeasures are and where things stand with this thing? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Sure. So I'm not going to talk about what the countermeasures are that we've put into place. They're clearly competitive. But I have looked very closely at the potential impact of accumulator programs on Enbrel both in the first quarter where I saw minimal to nothing and again for the second quarter where I saw minimal to nothing and I'm not forecasting much in the third quarter beyond. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Let's go to the next question. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat - Evercore ISI : Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I figured I'll ask both Tony and Sean a question each. So, perhaps first, Sean, maybe just a little confusion on your response on one of the prior questions on AMG 520. I guess what I'm asking is why not enroll non-carriers? Do you think they'll perform better and it'll be harder to tease out a signal? Just want to understand why not have it in your Phase 3 program? And then, Tony, my question to you was just to clarify how Neulasta's economics work the way it's structured currently in the face of biosimilars? And specifically what I was looking to understand was, A, is any part of Onpro reimbursed via Part D as in David? And then also the economics, how they work for 340Bs versus clinics, and whether some part of market could be rebated more or could be more defendable, that kind of thing? Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. A lot of questions there. We'll try to take those one at a time. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Right. So with respect to the strategy we're using, so the way to think about it is that we're focused on testing people before it's potentially too late to be able to show disease modification. And so we believe that means that people have to be cognitively normal on an intense battery of cognitive testing. But if you imagine bringing people in who don't have a predisposing genetic driver to have them be very likely to develop the cognitive impairment in the relatively near future, you're going to be doing this study forever. So what we decided to do was basically enrich for people who have both a certain age and the APOE status that they were likely to have enough events of people going from cognitively normal to cognitively impaired during the course of a trial that won't take forever. And given that this represents 60% of people with Alzheimer's disease, it seems like a pretty reasonable strategy to me. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So as regards Neulasta, Umer, all of Neulasta's Part B. Nothing is in Part D. From a reimbursement perspective, Part B is obviously under ASP plus. ASP depends on what your prices are today and what they'll evolve to be in a few quarters time. As Amgen, as a company, we've always presented our position very strongly to both the environment and to CMS and the government that we prefer a level playing field between our sales and biosimilars in the future and allow normal competitive factors in the marketplace to allow us to compete equally. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Ian, let's take the next question. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions, and best of luck to Sean and Tony on next steps and congrats to Dave. Maybe first just for Tony on Repatha. Was wondering what percent of lives now have the eased utilization management criteria. And with the new treatment guidelines expected later this year do you think that'll have a further impact on access? And then maybe just for Sean on AMG 301 you mentioned the PAC1 antibody. What are you hoping to see from this Phase 2 trial and if it's positive could you move right into Phase 3? Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. So again a couple questions there, Repatha, the utilization management question and then how guidelines may affect. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So as I said, about 65% of our business at the moment is going to move towards at a station only. And in terms of total evolution of the commercial business that's probably between 25% and 40% of the total lives available. I think as we continue to negotiate the other plans we will get better utilization management criteria. I do believe we're going to get better access. The drug is proving to be something that physicians and cardiologists are prescribing consistently continually and the demand from patients is still there. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah. And, Terence, for AMG 301, our PAC1 antibody receptor antagonist, we're doing something very similar to what we did with Aimovig where the proof-of-concept trial also includes the dose ranging, all predicated on some dermal blood flow assays that were done in healthy subjects to pinion the dose ranging. So if we're successful in demonstrating proof-of-concept, hopefully we also would have enough dose information to be able to proceed directly into Phase 3 as we were able to do with Aimovig, but, of course, we'll see. This is a novel pathway that needs to be validated in humans through this experiment. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Let's go to the next question. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners LLC. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC : Thank you very much and repeat the congratulations to Tony and to Sean. One quick question, perhaps for Bob on rebates. Could you give us a sense of what impact elimination of the Safe Harbor for rebating would have on Amgen's product access and price? And then I hate to sort of pursue this Alzheimer's question again, but, Sean, could you talk as you're sort of looking at leaving Amgen, what are the barriers to exploring all the sensible combination ideas that might be out there in Alzheimer's given all the frustration that the industry has had with single product trials? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay, Geoff. Maybe I'll answer your rebate question in two parts. I'll start, and then, Tony, you can jump in. So big picture, Geoff, as you know, the discussion about rebates is underway. The administration has asked for perspectives, and we've participated with our industry colleagues in sharing our thoughts about this. We think that the administration is focusing on an important topic here, which is rebates and the impact that the rebate structure in our industry has on patient affordability. So we welcome an opportunity to be able to share our industry perspectives with decision makers in the government, and that process is underway. It's a little bit premature I think to talk about what the specifics of your question were on our business, but I'll invite Tony to share his thoughts. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So the only thing I could add to what Bob was saying is that clearly in competitive markets your rebates tend to be higher. And so the gap between your list price and your net price tends to get quite large, none of which allows patients to benefit from, of course, because they're paying co-pays, co-insurance or deductibles based on the list price. If the rebates went away, by definition your list prices would get closer to net prices, and patients would be able to access drug better. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: And maybe one last thought \u2013 sorry, Geoff \u2013 and then we'll kick to Sean. Rebates and the structure that exists today evolved over many decades. It's hard to imagine what the impact of unraveling that would be if that unraveling occurred quickly. But, again, we're part of the discussion. We look forward to trying to figure out whether there isn't a better way for patients than what's in place today. Sean, why don't you... Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah. It's a great question, Geoff. I think that what I would say is that it's difficult given the costs and complexity and duration of these kind of trials to imagine going directly into combination without having demonstrated some efficacy and safety of the individual interventions. And I think there is a very strong logic behind combination and the disease because we know from the human genetics that one problem is APP processing and the generation of fragments like Abeta. And that another problem is the way in which the glial cells in the brain handle the subsequent cell detritus and death and inflammation. And that's pretty clear from the genetics which has largely been elucidated by deCODE. And so we think that we'll get there and that there will be combination therapy. But we probably need to see one of the individual components validated. And then you'll see people adding on to that therapy to try and see a more dramatic impact on disease progression. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Let's go to the next question. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Robyn, are you there? Okay. Ian, let's go to the next one. Operator : Very well. And our next question is from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question, and I also wanted to offer congrats to Sean and to Tony. Just a question on healthcare policy. I know there's been a lot of talk about \u2013 with respect to biosimilars, interchangeability, and, Tony, want to get your perspective on maybe how close we are on that. And then the other issue is Part B to Part D conversions, or the demo project, kind of what your thoughts are on that. Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Maybe we'll ask Sean to talk about the appropriateness of interchangeability from a regulatory standpoint first, Geoff, and then, Tony, feel free to add any thoughts you have. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah. I think obviously there are two aspects to this. There's the regulatory piece which varies from country to country. In the U.S., as you probably know, the agency has provided reasonably clear guidance around what's necessary to achieve the interchangeability, but that hasn't really been put into practice yet. People are doing trials that are designed to meet that standard. No one has had an approval based on it yet, so there's a learning curve there. But that will be an important goal that some companies will pursue with their products. Then there's the question of whether there may be, if you will, interchangeability policies that will exist at the level of payers, and who can potentially do whatever they want independent of the regulatory component. That, Tony, maybe you could comment on. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Sure. So, I mean, as we said, NEUPOGEN to us is probably the best example of the existing system allowing biosimilars to access the marketplace. After three years, they hold the majority market share and, therefore, we continue to put forward our proposal that the market be left as is, that we keep the playing field level, that we allow the normal competitive framework of the marketplace to take place. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And talk about B to D. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. I'm not sure exactly what you're getting at, Geoff, but obviously one of the things that's being discussed in Washington is whether it makes sense to consider the movement of certain drugs from Part B to D. And, again, there are early stages of discussions about what that would look like and for which products it would be irrelevant. So premature I think to speculate about whose products would be included in that over what time and what impact. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Ian, let's go to the next one. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Also let me add my congratulations to Sean and Tony on the retirements as well as to David on his well-deserved promotion. So a question is for Sean. I wanted to ask about BCMA, and kind of what you see as the bar in your ongoing Phase 1 trials. And are you looking at your products more as monotherapy assets or as part of existing combinations down the road? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah. I think this antigen is going to likely prove to be fairly transformative in the disease. And the question becomes the modality that you go after it with. As I mentioned, we're less impressed with what we're seeing with the ADCs and the BiTE technology appears to be capable of generating early data, small numbers of patients, very dramatic results. Whether you gain anything from a cell-based therapy directly against this antigen? Nobody knows because there's no \u2013 not even a way to do an indirect comparison at this point, let alone any kind of direct comparison. So it'll be really interesting. I think, of course, initially, we'll be studying it as a monotherapy in patients who are late stage and have undergone many rounds of attempts to treat the disease. But one could easily imagine a therapy like this entering all lines of therapy and including attempts to cure the disease in the first-line settings. Dave, you may want to comment further as - David M. Reese - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, no, it's a very good question and, of course, we would anticipate the initial forays to be as monotherapy but there are a variety of potential biologic combinations that make sense. And we will plan to also aggressively develop those over time. As Sean mentioned earlier, we're hoping to be able to present publicly sometime later in the year on some of the first clinical data from these programs. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Let's move on. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets. Kennen MacKay - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. A quick one on the EVENITY resubmission. I was wondering just how you were thinking about this internally. There was obviously some hope at least on the Street that the independent blinded re-review would suggest some kind of missed adjudication of events, which may really help the resubmission. And then, secondly on Neulasta, just wanted to get your perspective on sort of the strength of the Onpro defense if a hospital protocol has changed. I know a lot of time and effort went into getting Onpro onto hospital protocols. I was just hoping to get your perspective as to how large of a barrier this is. For instance, how challenging this could be to be changed to Mylan's generic? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks, Kennen. Why don't we have Sean answer the first question and, Tony, if you'd take the second question? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah. So with respect to EVENITY, we did a very comprehensive scouring of the clinical databases and then re-adjudicated all of the events that were originally identified plus any that have been identified subsequently. The good news is that it showed that our research platform is very robust, because when we redid this we saw pretty much the same thing we did the last time when we did it originally. The bad news is that it didn't really change the dataset for the potential safety signal. It is the opinion and this is just an opinion of the people involved both at Harvard and here at Amgen that the most likely explanation for the finding in the alendronate-controlled trial is chance. We think that's most likely. However, that's not going to be good enough to mean that you're not going to have a need to warn patients about a potential risk. And I'd say we think we're sort of back where we were before we did the exercise. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. And then to answer your question on Neulasta Onpro. So, to remind you again that all the institutions are working as hard as anyone else is to improve on the efficiencies of their processes. Most of the large teaching institutions took about 12 to 18 months to change their clinical practice, because it does apparently take some time to change clinical practice in a large institution. The benefit of this one is, of course, is it changes the entire protocol about how you treat a patient, how many times a patient has to come back to the institution, how many times the oncology pharmacist has to be remixing, how many times the oncology nurse has to be infusing, and how many times the oncologist has to be there which is all on top of the fact that a lot of patients live far from the hospital and have a problem to come back the next-day when they're suffering from the side effects of high dose chemo. So what we've delivered is not just a unique opportunity to give better value to patients who can spend more time at home, who are going to have the drug administered at home but we've also taken out a huge amount of inefficiency in the institutions which allows the nurses, the oncologists, and the pharmacist to go and do something else. So one assumes that the value we bring is more than just the drug itself. It's truly an augmented value and we believe that's fairly sticking. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Ian, let's take the next question. And just a quick reminder that if you can please limit yourself to one question, so (01:04:35). Let's go to the next one. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Phillip Nadeau from Cowen & Company. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on Repatha. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned that price was going down because of the agreements that have recently been signed. Can you talk a little bit about the time course of that decline in price? When did it start? Did it start in Q2 or is it starting on July 1 and when will price stabilize again? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So the list price hasn't changed. Some of the rebates by contract have changed. Some of the newer contracts become effective July 1 and we're clearly having to be competitive in the marketplace to maintain these contracts. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Ian, next question. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Carter Gould from UBS. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats to Sean and Tony. I guess for Sean or David, coming back to the BCMA question. How should we be thinking about 420 relative to 701? Is there any differentiation other than the half-life format and then sort of is 420 just sort of proof of principle and then the strategy would be the switch to 701? Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: David, why don't you? David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah. No. Thanks for the question and it's a good one. 420 as you may know advanced into the clinic earlier than 701. And so our intent at this time is to continue advancing both molecules until such time as we've generated datasets definitive enough for us to make a decision. All things being equal, of course, we'll take forward the half-life extended molecule. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Aharon Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Let me just add my congratulations to both Sean and Tony for their time with Amgen. As we're talking about biosimilar let me just ask something there. First, Tony, I was wondering about Herceptin subQ in Europe since you're launching the molecule. Do you think that segment of the market will be protected from biosimilar competition or do you think this is accessible? And then in the United States, I noticed you've signed a lot of agreements with various providers around oncology. And I was wondering do those agreements provide economical advantages for those providers to continue to use Neulasta over the biosimilar over the duration of the agreement. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. So any innovative SKU to any product, of course, makes the entry of the biosimilar a little bit more difficult. It doesn't make it impossible, so we're watching all those segments in Europe as we speak right now. And then as regards Neulasta and our customers in the U.S., we have fairly strong relationships with our customers, and we have continued to work hard to maintain and to expand those good relationships, yes. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Ian, let's take the next question. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo Securities. Jim Birchenough - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me in, and congrats, again, to Sean and Tony. I'm just wondering if you'd be willing to give any further detail on patients in the hub for Aimovig, whether you'd quantify those patients and give us a better sense of how many patients may be queued up in this bolus that may be coming. Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So we haven't made that public yet. We're trying to make sure that we understand how unique each of those patients are, coming in, and that they are appropriate patients. I would say that, as you watch the evolution of the prescriptions coming out of that, you'll start getting a feel of the size of the bolus. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: So, Ian, as it's well past 6 :00 p.m. on the East Coast, why don't we take two last questions? Operator : Very well. Our next question is from the line of Salim Syed from Mizuho. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Yeah. Hi, guys. And I'll throw my congrats as well to Sean and Tony and welcome to David. Just one on Aimovig probably for Tony. Tony, I was wondering if you can speak to \u2013 when we're thinking about Aimovig longer-term, so past this bolus here, what are the potential bottlenecks that you're seeing. Do you think that this is an area where you'll have to get reimbursement at the PCP level in order to not have a bottleneck in the system? And also the neurologists that are treating, do they have additional capacity to take in additional patients? Thank you. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc.: So there are about 20 headache specialty centers around the country at the moment, and the volume of patients they can take in depends on how much they expand over time or not. But it's a fairly large number of patients coming through them. And then, there are another couple of thousand neurologists who clearly are prescribers. But I do believe that the role of primary care physicians down the road becomes important. They do see patients and their ability to refer patients who are appropriate for a drug like Aimovig would be critical for the long-term value of this drug, yes. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Ian, let's take one last question. Operator : And our last question is from the line of Brian Skorney from Robert W. Baird. Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I just wanted to ask a question on the pipeline on AMG 301 for migraine prevention. I was wondering if you can just help us understand the role that you guys see of PAC1 versus CGRP. And if successful, how do you kind of envision these being used, separately or a possibility for a combination down the line? Thanks. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc.: Yeah, I guess what I would say \u2013 this is Sean \u2013 is that the thing I'd stress is that these appear to be rather independent neural pathways in the system. And so if it works, if PAC1 inhibition works, one would expect that it's not likely that it's going to be kind of redundant to CGRP. So you could imagine situations in which patients who are poor responders to CGRP inhibition might respond to PAC1 or that the two together might give better efficacy, assuming that was tolerable. But that will all have to be figured out in the clinic, and we're just at the first step of trying to understand whether, as monotherapy, we can see the efficacy of the PAC1 pathway in the first place. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc.: Okay. Ian, well, thanks. Let me just say a couple of quick remarks. Obviously, we're encouraged by the strong start we've enjoyed to the first half of 2018 and hope our investors share our optimism for the long-term prospects of the business through the growth that we expect from our new and recently-launched products as well as our biosimilars and innovative pipeline. And, finally, I would be remiss if I didn't just take a moment to thank our staff for their continuing focus on our mission, which is to serve patients with innovative medicines that make the big difference for serious disease. So thank you to all our staff for their focus, the results of which you see in our report through the first six months. Look forward to talking to all of you in October. Thank you. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc.: Thanks, all, for your participation. If we didn't get to your question, feel free to call us. The IR team will be standing by for several hours. Thanks again.

I will now turn the call over to Tom Schall. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon to everyone listening. Thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2018 conference call. Today, I will highlight three points, all of which illustrate and substantiate an overriding theme, as you can see from Slide 3. That is, we are moving inexorably forward to our goal of advancing our clinical programs toward its regulatory submissions for marketing approval. Accordingly, today, first, I will talk about our clinical trials of our unique asset avacopan in two orphan kidney diseases and how we are now expanding the footprint of avacopan into dermatological disease. I will outline for you how this is lining up for a beautiful choreography of releasing three key sets of top line data in quick succession starting in the coming year. Second, I will address our second lead asset, CCX140, whose unique mechanism of action we believe holds the key to benefit another orphan kidney disease. Finally, I\u2019ll refer to the strength of our financial position before turning the call over to Susan for financial highlights of last quarter. Our value creation journey from scientific discovery to setting new standards of care in modern medicine is taking a huge and next step forward. Let me start with avacopan and the treatment of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic auto-antibody-associated, or ANCA-associated vasculitis, an orphan disease that is characterized by a wide spectrum of burden for patients summarized on Slide 4. As I reported on our last call, we completed our ADVOCATE Phase III pivotal trial enrollment in July. With more than 300 patients enrolled, we believe that the ADVOCATE trial is the largest, randomized controlled clinical trial of a novel drug candidate ever conducted in ANCA-associated vasculitis. And made no mistake, our aim is nothing short of a new standard of care one which bear patients from the scourge of all therapies such as chronic high doses of glucocorticosteroids that date back several decades. Based on the data to date, we believe that the ADVOCATE Phase III clinical trial will continue to provide strong clinical evidence of avacopan\u2019s ability to halt in vasculitis to halt it rapidly and durably, while also freeing patients from the noxious side effects of chronic high-dose steroids, which can include deaths, as well as longer-term disabilities and liberating ANCA patients from the greatly diminished quality of life associated with current standard therapy, including chronic steroids. The ADVOCATE trial will assess the durability of avacopan\u2019s impact on safety and efficacy over a sustained one year of treatment. We are confident that we\u2019ll be able to share top line data from this trial in the fourth quarter of this coming year 2019. With these data, we expect to submit a U.S. new drug application, or NDA, during the first-half of 2020. I\u2019ll remind you that data from the randomized controlled Phase II trials were compelling. Avacopan rapidly alleviated the signs and symptoms of ANCA-associated vasculitis. Avacopan also made people feel better as reported by validated quality of life outcomes instruments, and avacopan therapy significantly reduced the toxicity that occurs with the chronic use of steroids. In other words in Phase II, avacopan not only reduced the burden associated with the traditional standard of care, it also independently improved clinical outcomes for patients. The data to date suggests that avacopan can make improvement across the total burden of ANCA disease. We designed the Phase III ADVOCATE trial with this knowledge and accordingly are optimistic about the results. While the enrollment of ADVOCATE is complete, the hard work definitely continues. We are now focused on completing the trial with high-quality data sets and then preparing for our submission to the FDA, so that we can file as rapidly as possible. Meanwhile, we are working in parallel to fundamentally understand the market opportunities and dynamics and to formulate our commercial strategy. The ADVOCATE trial itself is big news for our company and more importantly, for the patients. But this is only the first in a cadence of successes readouts of top line data involving our uniquely differentiated molecule, which I will remind you, has the added benefit of being orally administered. Our second trial involving avacopan, which you can see on Slide 5, is for the treatment of C3 Glomerulopathy, or C3G. C3G is a rare disease that attacks the young and frequently requires a kidney transplant from a parent with relapse after the transplant all too tragically common. Based on emerging science and on expert investigator feedback, and with the aim of having the most comprehensive and controlled trial ever attempted in C3G, we have expanded our clinical study to 88 individuals in this randomized controlled trial. Half of the C3G patients will be on the empirically-derived standard of care and half will have avacopan therapy. Avacopan\u2019s performance will be assessed using a validated renal histology index at six months of therapy. The trial is not only blinded, but quite large relative to the C3G orphan patient population. To stress this point, our goal here is to have a definitive result. Can avacopan be the new standard of care in C3G? By successfully engaging the expert clinical community, we have 95% of our planned clinical sites activated and the investigators are enrolling patients at an excellent pace. Given the rapid enrollment so far in this trial, we hope the C3G trial will be fully enrolled in 2019. And given the fact that avacopan\u2019s performance will be evaluated after six months of treatment, we therefore expect that top line data from this trial could come one to two quarters after the data from the aforementioned ADVOCATE trial. Given the rarity of this disease, C3G, and the fact that there are no approved therapies, strong data could potentially support a registration application. The third trial I will touch on today is also for avacopan, but this time to treat patients in a different disease area with profound unmet medical need, as you can see from Slide 6. Hidradenitis Suppurativa, or HS, is a damaging and disfiguring skin disorder. Remarkably, the only registered therapy as sales totaling about $1 billion worldwide, despite being widely regarded as being only moderately effective. There is evidence from a proof-of-concept study that C5a is driving this disease, which is also known to be neutrophil-driven, so not unlike ANCA-associated vasculitis. Hence, the potential role for orally-administered avacopan. We recently attended the International HS Symposium in Toronto, and we were impressed by the widespread desire in both the patient and clinical communities for new approaches to this disease, particularly those with the convenience of an oral medication, such as avacopan. We\u2019ve had discussions with the FDA and are now ready before the end of this year to launch our clinical trial of avacopan in HS at multiple centers. This trial will be a large, definitive, three-armed randomized controlled trial with over 350 patients suffering from modest \u2013 moderate to severe HS. The trial will compare avacopan\u2019s placebo and use the HS clinical response core instrument, which has been previously validated by the FDA as a primary endpoint. Importantly, since this primary endpoint will be assessed after 12 weeks of treatment, although, we will, of course, follow patients for longer, we expect that we can provide top line results within a reasonably short timeframe after the C3G readout. To summarize, I will draw your attention to the three ways to win with avacopan, as you can see on Slide 7. We are planning for a cadence of top line data, that would start in the fourth quarter of 2019 with ADVOCATE data from ANCA vasculitis and will be followed one to two quarters later by data and C3 Glomerulopathy and then by the HS data soon thereafter. With three potential indications across two different disease areas of avacopan is a pipeline in a drug. Avacopan with its ability to precisely target the C5a receptor is unique in the world, and it enables us to advance avacopan in a number of important diseases, where C5a and the C5a receptor play an important role in pathogenesis. These diseases are characterized by high unmet need and likely significant commercial potential. I would remind you that avacopan\u2019s targeting of the C5a receptor is so precise that it does not impact the protective actions of a second C5a response of pathway known as C5L2. A growing body of recent literature, a test to the fact that C5a going to a second receptor, C5L2, has the important biological benefits. With avacopan, we leave C5L2 in intact by design, not serendipity. We knew that in the complement system, absolute precision should be the highest goal. And that through absolute precision, we could develop much more targeted medicines for better health. Let me now turn briefly to our second asset, CCX140. We were delighted in the third quarter that the FDA granted CCX140 orphan drug designation for Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS. As shown on Slide 8, FSGS is another debilitating orphan kidney condition that lacks an approved therapy. Our clinical trials involve two subpopulations of patients with primary FSGS. One, with so-called nephrotic syndrome and one in the sub-nephrotic population. These two trials are now proceeding in parallel and actively enrolling patients. At the meeting of the American Society of Nephrology last month, we presented new data on the novel mechanism of action that truly differentiates CCX140, a selective inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR2 from any other new molecules attempting to tackle FSGS. We now know that CCR2 has a direct role in the glomerulus in FSGS kidneys. We presented data at ASN that showed that the CCR2 inhibitor CCX140 may have a direct beneficial effect on podocytes in the glomerulus, i.e, those specialized filtration cells in the kidney. [indiscernible] explaining the rapid and durable benefit of reducing proteinuria that we have seen in both animal models and in humans. It was in that prior successful human trial, our Phase II trial of CCX140 in diabetic nephropathy that we also established a favorable safety profile over one year of continuous dosing of CCX140, while primary \u2013 while meeting the primary endpoint of a sustained and significant reduction in proteinuria. Proteinuria reduction is important since in, at least, one form of FSGS. This endpoint is likely to be the key endpoint through regulatory approval. Before I turn the call over to Susan, let me say a word about our financial strength. With clinical momentum growing ever stronger, our robust financial position allows us to conduct and complete all of the trials that we discussed today, while we simultaneously plan for commercialization of our first medication. As you recall, ChemoCentryx possesses all rights entirely for avacopan and CCX140 in the United States. For the international commercial rights for avacopan and CCX140, we have licensed those to our world-class partner, Vifor Pharma, who will pay us tiered royalties between the teens and the mid-20s on any aggregate net sales in their territories. I will say more about our preparations for commercialization in the United States on a future call. Susan? Susan Kanaya : Thank you, Tom. Our third quarter 2018 financial results were included in our press release today and are summarized on Slide 9. Revenue was $9 million for the third quarter, consistent with the same period in 2017. Revenue recognized represents amortization of the upfront license fees, milestone payments and collaboration funding from Vifor Pharma. Research and development expenses were $15.1 million for the third quarter, compared to $12.3 million in the same quarter in 2017. The increase in 2017 to 2018 was primarily attributable to the avacopan ADVOCATE Phase III pivotal trial, which completed enrollment in July 2018. General and administrative expenses were $5.4 million for the third quarter, compared to $3.6 million in the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, including those associated with our avacopan commercialization planning effort and increased professional fees. We recorded a net loss for the third quarter of $10.9 million, compared to $6.6 million in the third quarter of 2017. Total shares outstanding at September 30, 2018 were approximately 50.4 million shares. Finally, we ended the quarter with approximately $186 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Excluding cash receipts from milestone and upfront payments and credit facility advances, we used cash and investments of approximately $40.7 million for the first nine months of 2018, and we expect to end 2018 with approximately $170 million. Tom? Thomas Schall : Thank you, Susan. To summarize, as you can see again on our last slide, Slide 10. Our relentless pursuit of advancing clinical development has led us to the threshold of an exciting future. We are completing the ADVOCATE trial and preparing to share top line data in the fourth quarter of this coming year. Pivotal data from ADVOCATE and ANCA vasculitis will only be the first-of-a-series of three key data readouts of avacopan. As we then expect to report on our current C3G study shortly after the avacopan \u2013 ADVOCATE result, and thereafter on the large of avacopan HS trial. As to the second orphan disease drug assets, CCX140, as we conduct our clinical trials of CCX140 and FSGS, the FDA has recognized its potential on this disorder this past quarter by awarding CCX140 orphan drug status. Moreover, the new mechanism data that we presented at ASN last month underlines the promise of the unique CCX140 asset as well. Our financial strength enables us to push forward in multiple clinical programs simultaneously, while we prepare to commercialize avacopan in the United States. With that, I will now turn the call back over to the operator and look forward to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michelle Gilson with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Michelle Gilson : Hi, Susan. Hi, Tom, thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask you about now that you\u2019ve enrolled the Phase III study. Can you talk a little bit about the baseline characteristics of the patients in the study, especially given the entry criteria for ADVOCATE allowed for somewhat sicker patients versus CLEAR? And then can you also remind us on the data in that subset of the CLEAR population what that looks like? Did you see eGFR stabilization BVAS reductions in that segment of the population? Thomas Schall : Thank you, Michelle. That\u2019s a very good question. So by and large, the patients in Phase III very closely matched the patient population in disposition that we have in the Phase II studies, both CLEAR and CLASSIC studies. You\u2019re right, we\u2019ve allowed a little bit more liberal inclusion criteria when it comes to eGFR, and that is because we learned in the Phase II study that probably we are going to have a pretty good chance of arresting the advance of kidney decline or at least being able to opine on that based on what we saw in Phase II. And there were a couple of exceptional cases in Phase II, where we did allow somewhat lower eGFR into the study. So we do have some data on that. I would say that overall, the patient populations in the ADVOCATE trial are very similar to the patient population we saw in the Phase II CLEAR trial, they\u2019ve just scaled obviously for greater end. So I think that we are very sanguine about the possibility that the Phase III data should be fundamentally informed by what we saw on Phase II. Michelle Gilson : Okay. And then can you also remind us on the data that make you so confident in the long-term effect of avacopan and seeing the remission rates at 26 and 53? Thomas Schall : Yes, that\u2019s a great question. Thanks for asking. So fundamentally, it is probably valuable to recall the mechanism of action of avacopan, which is quite unlike any of the other therapies right now out there. We are arresting the ability of neutrophil to be activated through C5a receptor by C5a. That is fundamentally the damage-inducing step in systemic vasculitis and ANCA vasculitis. If we remove the ability of those neutrophil to be activated, both human clinical data, as well as extensive animal pharmacology suggest that, that fundamental terminal damage effector pathway is shutdown. And we\u2019ve shown that, again, both in preclinical models, we and others with an otherwise lethal brand of anti-myeloperoxidase antibody, which is one of the human handcarts [ph], a lethal anti-myeloperoxidase antibody glomerulonephritis model, which those animals are completely protected and quite healthy when you block C5a receptor with avacopan, those are published data, or if you genetically delete C5a receptor, no matter what else is going on in the animal system, including still having very high levels of ANCA antibody as long as you get rid of the neutrophils that could be activated by C5a receptor, you eliminate the disease. And how that reads to the human situation is, since folks will be taking avacopan chronically and durably in the case of the ADVOCATE study for continuously for 52 weeks, we believe fundamentally that we will have simply short circuited the terminal damage effector pathway of this disease, and therefore, response from remission should be quite durable. Moreover, we\u2019ve eliminated one of the very noxious parts of the standard of care, which is the chronic high dose steroids, which itself causes other kinds of damage not related to vasculitis. The reason that steroids are such a problem is also the reason in clinical practice they have to be tapered. And so as folks come off of those steroids, they tend to start having and this would be relevant to the control group, they tend to have a relapse of their symptomatology for ANCA vasculitis. So fundamentally, we believe that there is a \u2013 based on our models and based on the data to date, over the course of 26 weeks and then 52 weeks, the standard of care group should have more relapses by this loss of remission, whereas folks on our experimental drug should stay in remission since they\u2019re taking it in a chronic fashion. And so that\u2019s how the study has been set up. And again, it really does reveal the inadequacy of the current standard of care. People simply cannot stay on standard of care chronically, because it\u2019s too toxic frankly, and that really illuminates part of the unmet need. Michelle Gilson : Great. Thank you. Thomas Schall : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ed White with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open. Edward White : Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. So as always, Tom and Susan, you had a very clear and concise presentation. So I just have one question for you. I think, Tom, when you discussed HS, maybe I heard you wrong, but I thought you said 350 patients. Is it 350, or 390, or is it approximately 390? Thomas Schall : So, Ed, thank you for that question. To clarify, I think, I said in excess of 350. Right now, we\u2019re modeling or targeting 390. We\u2019ll have three groups in a controlled fashion of 130 each. And then, as I said, it\u2019s a blinded controlled trial, so it\u2019ll be a one to one to one randomization. Edward White : Okay, great. Thanks for clarifying that, Tom. And then the only other question I have was just, with the \u2013 are you going to release internal data from the HS study, or give us at least enrollment update similar to what you did with ADVOCATE in the C3G trial? Thomas Schall : Well, certainly, intending to give enrollment update, Ed, and then we won\u2019t be giving any interim data releases, however, other than, of course, the variety of which we discussed progress of enrollment, et cetera. We\u2019d love to \u2013 while we intend to entirely protect the integrity of that data set in HS, because it\u2019ll come as no surprise just by looking at the scale of that study that it\u2019s power to be a registration rate study. And for this orphan disease, a well-controlled study of that size, if the data are sufficiently strong, may well constitute the basis of an interesting registration discussion, particularly as it relates to the maturity of the asset in other areas. So it\u2019s one of the reasons we set up the study the way we did. Edward White : Okay, great. Thanks, Tom. Thanks for taking my questions. Thomas Schall : Thank you, sir. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Seedhouse with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Steven Seedhouse : Thank you for taking my questions. Tom, just a follow-up on the HS trial. Could you just clarify what, in addition to placebo, what the other two arms are? What are your assumptions, I guess, for the effect size that inform those trail numbers? Are you assuming similar or better response rates than you have? Thomas Schall : That\u2019s a great question, Steve. So what we have in the other two arms the ones who are not placebo are the two doses that we\u2019ve got great experience with in Phase II. We\u2019ve got the 30 mg twice-a-day dose and a 10 mg twice-a-day dose. It\u2019s intended and again, we\u2019re covering the constellation of possibilities of both biological and clinical effect. So we want to be comprehensive about that. The assumption is as a minimum working assumption that we ought to be able to detect the same delta that you might had over background therapies quite handily with this size of study. So that would be the baseline assumption. Steven Seedhouse : Okay, great. And is this \u2013 are you plan on enrolling this trial at centers that have experience with infrared [ph] is C5a antibody and just given that trial completed enrollment, I just think it would give us a sense of sort of your cadence of enrollment would be similar? Thomas Schall : There is no question there will be some overlap and there\u2019ll be other sites that are probably not experienced in that particular trial. But we will avail ourselves of all of the experienced sites that we can. And I haven\u2019t talked about the number of sites we\u2019re targeting, but it\u2019s a greater number than our friends at infrared. So we\u2019ll have even more sites than they did. Steven Seedhouse : Okay, I appreciate that. And just last question, so can you just update us on the status of their conditional marketing authorization application in Europe? Just \u2013 what the CHMPs date 120 questions mentioned in your 10-Q and recent prospectus pertain to? It sounds like they comprised clinical, non-clinical and quality of these questions, things that would need to be addressed for your eventual full filing, or are they specific to the conditional application just based on not having completed Phase III? Thomas Schall : Yes. Thank you, Steve. We \u2013 the day 120 questions for us really didn\u2019t constitute any real surprises qualitatively. They were very thorough and extensive. You\u2019ll recall the conditional marketing authorization application is based on the 12-week Phase II data. So inevitably, there were questions related and specific to CMA, given the length of the data experience that we had to date. And so none of the questions were surprising. I think, we \u2013 one can look at the standard calendar for the EMA, and I can \u2013 it\u2019s easy to deduce that we have responded by this time and we quite thoroughly responded to all their questions, whether they were in the CMC space, the off-clinical programs or even questions on clinical issues. So we will just have to see how that goes. We\u2019re not again just using standard EMA timelines. We would not anticipate a full opinion to be rendered until sometime in the spring leaves us with the interesting conundrum of what we might do with the 12-week license, even if it were approved at that time given the fact that our full 52-week data is only a couple of quarters away from that. So some interesting logistical questions there. But to answer your question in brief, yes, we had a slate of questions, again, none of which were qualitatively surprising to us. We answered them and that package is still under review at this time. Steven Seedhouse : Great. Okay, very clear. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Thomas Schall : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Konstantinos Aprilakis with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Jon Helander : Hey, guys, this is Jon Helander for Konstantinos. Thanks for taking my questions. So on the last call, you indicated you might get the full Japan enrollment by the end of this quarter\u2026 Thomas Schall : Yes. Jon Helander : \u2026and time with your full data release. So are you seeing sufficient numbers there? Thomas Schall : Yes. Thank you. That\u2019s a very good question. It\u2019s a bit of a nuance in the subtlety. But yes, Japan enrollment is also fully complete. And so we have all of the global enrollment now in hand. Again, without going into too many details, the total number of folks enrolled around the world there for us is 331. The original design of the study was not to include Japan under the original concept. So you\u2019ve seen a number of 316 as our full enrolment from the previous calls and the previous disclosures. But yes, Japan is done. And so that, that too is now rolling along. The Japan cohort will not necessarily hold up the evaluation of the previous full Phase III enrollment cohort. But the details will be worked out as we go along and see how the database cleaning and database lock dates will look as we go forward. Jon Helander : All right, thanks. That\u2019s clear. And then do you plan on releasing any kind of interim data perhaps around that 26-week mark for the ADVOCATE trial? Thomas Schall : Also a very good question. And the short answer is, no. And the reason is the way we\u2019ve set up the trial is that, we will collect all of the data on 52 weeks before we start analyzing any of the data. And then when we analyze the data from 26 weeks, then subsequently 52, which is part of the primary endpoint, we\u2019ll do it in a hierarchical fashion. And the reason for that is, we didn\u2019t want to spend any alpha as we analyze this data. And so we thought it was a very and continue to think it\u2019s a very clever and important design. So we won\u2019t see any week 26 \u2013 we won\u2019t see any week 26 data. We\u2019ll let last patient come out and then we\u2019ll do all of the analysis once we have the full 52-week data sets, but statistically we\u2019ll do in a hierarchical way. Jon Helander : All right, and that make sense. Last question, if I can. Could you also discuss how you guys view implications between non-inferiority versus superiority of the final readout? Thomas Schall : Yes, that a very good question. And again, it\u2019s one of these subtle, but important points that can be easily misunderstood. But let me try to clarify it. In this indication, which is an orphan disease, Non-inferiority in week 26 is the sole regulatory precedent certainly at the level of statistical analysis. And that was evidenced by the previous trial called RAVE, where rituximab was offered as an alternative to cyclophosphamide, both of those, however, in combination with high doses of chronic steroids. So it provides something of a precedent. And there, the null hypothesis statistically was the statistical non-inferiority of RAVE versus [indiscernible] standard of care, which was of rituximab plus steroids rather versus the [indiscernible] standard of care of cyclophosphamide plus steroids. And so that was fulfilled. Now non-inferiority sounds so lackluster in plain English. But in point of fact, it\u2019s a defined statistical term, which is really the only test one can use it in indications such as this, where the new agent is thought to have an advantage over the incumbent. So at very least, you only want to be no worse at the specified endpoint, in this case, Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, because the new agents is thought to have other advantages as well, which are measured outside of the primary endpoint also. In addition, superiority endpoints statistically even when numerical superiority is achieved, may be limited by the number and/or patient population you can get into the trial in an orphan indication. So all of those are just some background notes. And again, our 26-week endpoint is perfectly consistent with the single Phase III regulatory precedent that we have, which is extracted from the RAVE trial. We think that \u2013 we\u2019re confident after discussions with regulatory agents \u2013 agencies rather that, that same 26-week endpoint will provide sufficient impetus, at least, in Europe, if we\u2019re successful to gain license for ANCA vasculitis. We are, in addition, however, we were highly desirous of looking at durable or sustained remission, which is why we built in the 52-week endpoint in this study, because after all this is a chronic disease with relapsing remitting and we wanted to know whether we could not just induce a remission, but sustain it. So we built in a 52-week endpoint, where again, we will first ask the question, are we statistically non-inferior to the standard of care, that is, is avacopan without chronic high-dose steroid, at least, as good than the standard of care, which originally have in chronic high-dose steroid in terms of durable remission with 52-week. If we achieve that endpoint statistically, we\u2019ll then ask the subsequent question, are we actually statistically superior at week 52? And we think there is a reasonable chance that we will be superior at week 52, because the standard of care group will A, be liable to have more relapses during that time and perhaps they\u2019ll also have more dropouts during the period of the one-year dosing. So we\u2019re very sanguine about the possibility of not just sitting non-inferiority at week 26 and week 52, but the possibility that we might actually convert also to having superiority at week 52. But I will stress in terms of regulatory precedent, there\u2019s only one precedent, which is non-inferiority at weeks 26. We\u2019re convinced in the EMA that gets us a license if it\u2019s both non-inferiority at week 26 and 52, we believe we have a license, as I mentioned in Europe and possibly in the U.S., and if we\u2019re superior at week 52, clearly, we have a very, very good case to make here in the U.S. for a license as well. Both agencies just to sum up and give you the fuller picture around the data are very keen though to see all of the analyses that were pre-specified, because all of those relate to the total burden of disease, as I alluded to on the slide, I believe it was Slide 4 in the deck, and that\u2019s really important now in the modern era ANCA vasculitis. So the BVAS endpoint only refers to one of the four categories of the total burden of disease in both FDA and EMA have said, please bring us all of the data and if it scales the way it did in Phase II with avacopan, that will be a very powerful discussion with those agencies. Jon Helander : Great. That was extremely informative. Thanks for taking my question. Thomas Schall : Sure. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Anupam Rama with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tessa Romero : Hi, all, thanks for taking the question and for the updates on the quarter. This is Tessa filing in for Anupam this evening. Maybe one from last one competitive question. Based on the data to date, how might avacopan be differentiated to some of the other complement-based approaches, specifically in HS? And then maybe one on CCX140, if I could. How we should be thinking about first enrollment and then timelines to data for the SGS2 2 trials? And I think you said it was somewhere in the 2020 timeframe. Thanks so much, guys. Thomas Schall : Great. Both excellent questions, Tessa. Thank you for those questions. So avacopan in some fundamental ways couldn\u2019t be more different than other approaches and complement intervention even right down to HS. For example, if we use the HS example, the other approach that I know of is an antibody against C5a. Avacopan is a orally active small molecule against the C5aR, C5a receptor. The antibody has to be dosed at \u2013 currently, as far as I can tell, once a week by infusion, our drug is taken by mouth daily. The antibody is a chimeric antibody, that is to say, it was made in a mouse. So it\u2019s mouse anti-human, at least, partially mouse. That means, it\u2019s liable to have immunogenicity over time, which could lead to a loss of efficacy. The antibody does not bind the receptor, binds the ligand. There maybe significant challenges just by way of, what we call, mass action, since we don\u2019t know the concentration of ligand in the local environment, but we know that in some local environments, it can be actually huge, getting the antibody to the site of action and sufficient quantity is something that remains to be demonstrated clinically, and it\u2019s very difficult, if not impossible, to demonstrate experimentally. By contrast, our small molecule binds up the receptor, making the receptors simply unavailable to ligand, irrespective of how much quantity of ligand you have in the environment. We\u2019ve shown that in model systems. In vivo, we\u2019ve shown it experimentally. In vitro and we\u2019ve shown it by extrapolation in human subjects very, very clearly. The receptor is pharmacologically inert, doesn\u2019t matter how much C5a is throw into the system. Then finally and importantly, Tessa, by binding up C5a as with an antibody, there may be untoward consequences biologically, because as I alluded to in my remarks, there is a second pathway, where C5a binds to another molecule, another receptor called C5L2. And C5L2 is well documented to have a biological benefit in the complement system. I could cite a handful of papers, which basically have in the title anti-inflammatory functions for complement C5L2 binding protein, disruption of compliments C5L2 exaggerates inflammation, et cetera, C5L2 is the second C5a receptor suppresses acute lung injury, that is when it\u2019s functioning. And so we could go on and on. So if given a choice, and I have a choice and we engineered this into our molecules some years ago, I would love and think it\u2019s imperative to leave C5L5 in tact to perform its good functions, while eliminating only the functions of C5aR, which is what avacopan targets. So that\u2019s the differentiation with other approaches. There is other complement intervention strategies for other diseases. Most of them are upstream in the complement cascade, and I think those could be more difficult to manage in the long-term for chronic care. So I won\u2019t really go into any of those in detail now that we\u2019ve covered the HS landscape. CCX140 and FSGS, very good question. FSGS, again, these trials are launched now. We\u2019re actively recruiting in two forms of primary FSGS and again, looking at the ability of CCX140 to reduce proteinuria in this patient population as we have shown it do in a previous successful large Phase II study in diabetic chronic kidney disease, where CCX140 continuously dosed for 52 weeks, lowered \u2013 durably lowered proteinuria above and beyond the background medications that it was added to. And that was a double-blinded trial. So it\u2019s a very nice study. I would love to be able to tell you exactly when we\u2019re going to have these enrolled. The first trial is in patients with nephrotic syndrome levels of proteinuria. These are very, very ill patients that have greater than 3.5 grams of protein in their urine relative to the ratio of creatinine in their serum. And these people progress extremely rapidly to end-stage renal disease and dialysis and even worse. Everyone thinks that by reducing the proteinuria to sub-nephrotic levels or even substantially reducing it, some of these folks who come into the clinic with 10 or 20 grams of protein in their urine, even substantially reducing it on a percentage basis, we\u2019ll definitely help with the delay of progression to end-stage renal disease since the protein itself becomes an insulting agent to the kidney and its tubules, for example. So that\u2019s a small study. The first cohort we\u2019re going to look at is about six or seven people. But even getting data on 12 or 13 people could begin to constitute an interesting discussion with FDA should protein lowering the significant in those small handful of primary nephrotic FSGS patients about how to license that drug in that indication for that limited population. We hope by the end of this coming year to have sufficient data from that study with the nephrotic syndrome patients to be able to start entertaining the discussion with agents \u2013 agencies or at least knowing what we need to do in the next step to bring home a definitive answer in nephrotic FSGS. So and I\u2019ll have more to say that \u2013 about that in 2019. Similarly, with the parallel study in the sub-nephrotic population, that\u2019s a program, which is running as a four-arm study with the placebo control, where CCX140 is added on top of the protocolized empirically-derived standard of care. There are no FDA approved therapies, by the way, as you probably know. And we hope to have that four-arm cohort enrolled by the end of 2019, which will look at a 12-week reduction in proteinuria and see if we have a significant reduction in any or all of the three arms relative to the control and then what we will do there is decide, which dose should we expand versus control, again, to try to increase and have a discussion with the FDA about how to register the drug ultimately in sub-nephrotic FSGS. So it\u2019s early days yet, but I\u2019m hopeful that through 2019, we\u2019ll make significant progress such that in 2020, I\u2019ll have some clinical readouts in FSGS as well. But we\u2019ll firm up that picture as we get into 2020 and we\u2019ll have more to say about that in detail. Tessa Romero : Great. Thank you very much, Tom, for all the color. I appreciate it.

At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Tom Schall. Tom? Thomas Schall : Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon to everyone listening. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 conference call. For those of you, who are following on the slide, Slide 3 shows that in 2018, we demonstrated our ability to execute across multiple clinical trials, giving us confidence that we will continue to deliver on our 2019 goals and indeed beyond. I am proud of our accomplishments in 2018. Among others, we achieved the following four notable milestones. One, we completed the enrollment of the ADVOCATE Phase III pivotal trial of our C5a receptor inhibitor of avacopan in ANCA or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic auto-antibody-associated vasculitis on schedule, indeed and what some have called record-tying. Two, in Q4 of last year, we dosed the first patient in our large AURORA trial of avacopan for patients with Hidradenitis Suppurativa. This is a historic moment for ChemoCentryx as we go beyond kidney disease into dermatological diseases. Three, we made excellent progress in our clinical trials of avacopan in C3 glomerulopathy and also in the trial of our second unique asset, the CCR2 inhibitor CCX140 in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis. Four, we are now looking forward to a cascade of catalysts over the next 18 months in which we expect multiple topline data readouts starting of course with ADVOCATE data in Q4 of this year. And let's not forget the very strong execution on our plan has enabled us to attract the capital we need to move forward on these major and data rich trials simultaneously while planning for commercialization in the U.S. Let's talk about this March progress that CCXI has made through our late-stage clinical trials. I will start with the ADVOCATE trial as referenced in Slide 4. A trial that we believe represents the largest randomized controlled clinical trial of a new drug candidate ever in ANCA-associated vasculitis. The current standard of care treatment in ANCA is high-doses of daily steroids, such as prednisone or methylprednisone, coupled with a powerful immunosuppressant that is steroids coupled either with rituximab, also called RITUXAN, or steroids coupled with cyclophosphamide. Importantly, this two-pronged standard of care regimen is limited to about six months of acute therapy, because of the significant mortality and morbidity it causes, particularly from the high-dose daily steroid regimen. Make no mistake, there is an unmet need today for a new therapeutic that will lead to a both a safe induction as well as a durable remission of active vasculitis in ANCA-associated vasculitis. This malady cries out for a new remedy, patients want a therapy that will stop the disease fast, prevent relapses and free them from the terrible afflictions of both the disease and of the chronic steroid use, thus greatly improving their quality of life. Our belief is that avacopan will be the answer and that it will establish a desperately needed new standard of care, a new standard which makes regimens that include high-doses of chronic steroids simply obsolete. The pathway ahead is clear, pending positive ADVOCATE data in Q4, we plan to file full regulatory submissions for marketing approval next year in the U.S. and in Europe. These marketing applications will be based on the 52-week data from the ADVOCATE pivotal Phase III trial involving more than 300 patients. We are focusing on demonstrating the effective, rapid and sustained remission of ANCA vasculitis, thus reducing the total burden of disease for ANCA vasculitis patients and improving their quality of life. Accordingly, the primary endpoint of the ADVOCATE trial is to show the ability to squelch the active vasculitis symptoms as measured by something called the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score or BVAS. We will measure BVAS in both the avacopan group that is those who get active avacopan, but no daily dose of steroids and also the standard of care group who get the daily dose of steroids, but no of avacopan, and we will measure their BVAS remission at weeks 26 and 52. Put most simply, the ADVOCATE trial aims to confirm, a) that there are rapid and beneficial effects of avacopan on reducing the BVAS score, hence eliminating the active vasculitis and this is extrapolating from the earlier successful Phase II clinical trial results. We also wish to show that this effect is durable. b) We wish to show and confirmed that the need for chronic high doses of steroids and with them the debilitating consequences of steroid use can be eliminated when avacopan is used to treat ANCA vasculitis. The two endpoints of BVAS remission at weeks 26 and weeks 52 are engendered by the nature of the disease and how ANCA vasculitis has been treated historically. BVAS remission is defined. It's defined in ADVOCATE as it has been in past Phase III trials of other agents in ANCA vasculitis. Specifically, BVAS remission equals a BVAS score of zero, but also one must be off of daily steroids for at least four weeks. Therefore, BVAS remission cannot be measured until week 26 at the earliest because the daily doses from the steroid regimen must be tapered to zero over the first approximately five months. The precedent for this definition of BAVS remission is a regulatory endpoint was established previously by the Phase III trials of rituximab, especially in the so-called RAVE trial. RAVE showed rituximab plus daily steroids and note that daily steroids are still part of the regimen with rituximab, in terms of controlling active vasculitis signs and symptoms was at least as good i.e. statistically non-inferior to the previously established regimen of daily steroids combined with cyclophosphamide. This was based on the proportion of patients that achieved BVAS remission at week-26, about six months between the two groups. After the RAVE trial, daily steroid doses tapered over six months plus rituximab or daily steroid doses plus cyclophosphamide, which is still used became the standard of care. Note in both cases, the daily steroid regimen is part of the standard of care. In ADVOCATE, achieving the BVAS remission at week-26 as defined would be a big win. It has only been done once before in a registration trial, the RAVE trial of rituximab. Beyond 26 weeks, the purpose of the 52-week endpoint is to determine the durability of remission induced by avacopan as measured again by BVAS. We hope and believe based on data and extrapolation that the ADVOCATE trial will show that at week-52 avacopan therapy is at least as good or possibly has an advantage in durable remission over the standard of care arm. Our expectation here is driven in part by the knowledge that some patients for example, on the standard of care start to relapse once they come off the high-dose chronic steroid therapy. Also as I mentioned before, BVAS remission is but one important marker for ANCA vasculitis patients. It is an important one to be sure, but perhaps equally important are the other components of the total burden of disease in ANCA vasculitis. In fact, some would say it cannot be overstressed, how these other factors in the total burden of disease in ANCA represent a huge unmet therapy need and we believe accordingly a large pharmaco-economic opportunity as well. We believe avacopan has the potential to broadly benefit patients and alleviate across the entire spectrum of the total burden of disease. Why? Data from the Phase II CLEAR trial of avacopan set a compelling precedent for us and the experts. The Phase II data show that avacopan rapidly alleviated not only the signs and symptoms of ANCA vasculitis as measured by BVAS, but also improve the overall quality of life patients, inpatients, as well as demonstrating many objective improvements in measures that show preservation of organ function, particularly in the kidney and other metrics. Moreover, there was evidence that avacopan therapy accomplished these benefits, while patients also enjoyed a reduction in the toxicity caused by chronic use of steroids. We are measuring many of the same objective parameters of ANCA disease in Phase III ADVOCATE trial. In meetings with regulators, they too have indicated, they are interested in how avacopan might actually improve the total burden of this disease. As referred to in Slide 5, including the quality of life and objective biological responses such as glucocorticoid-induced toxicities, changes in the vascular damage index and stabilization of the Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate. All of these are complications that are associated with steroids and we and others are keen to see if they will improve in Phase III as they did in Phase II. As I mentioned, all of these endpoints were measured in the Phase II trial with avacopan when compared to the daily high-dose steroid containing standard of care. So we have modeled the Phase III ADVOCATE trial on the Phase II CLEAR trial, deriving confidence from those previous results. Look for the release of topline data from ADVOCATE in Q4 of this year and we plan to make full regulatory submissions in 2020. ADVOCATE and ANCA vasculitis may have opened the valve in our avacopan pipeline in the drug strategy, but we have opened it still further providing a flow of potentially very high value orphan disease indications for this drug. For example, let me now turn to our AURORA trial of avacopan in the treatment of Hidradenitis Suppurativa or HS referred to on Slides 6 and 7. AURORA is a large randomized controlled and potentially registration supporting Phase IIb trial and it is our first late-stage clinical trial outside of renal disease for avacopan. This demonstrates that the science of C5a receptor inhibition has applications in multiple disease indications. HS is a damaging and disfiguring skin disorder driven by neutrophils, which are activated by C5a binding to its proinflammatory receptor, the C5aR, C5a receptor. Avacopan target C5aR with exquisite selectivity. Currently adalimumab, also known as Humira is the only approved medication for HS and sales exceed about $1 billion worldwide for Humira in HS. This is despite the fact that Humira is fairly regarded as having only a somewhat modest effect in HS, published studies for example, so just that only about half the patients with moderate to severe HS disease receive some early benefit and of those, roughly have find that the treatment loses its effect over time. The unmet need therefore, in terms of combating this disease and improving quality of life is clear. We dosed the first patient with avacopan in our AURORA trial in HS in late December. The AURORA trial design is depicted on Slide 7. AURORA is a randomized controlled trial of some 390 patients spread across three arms. We believe it is the largest randomized controlled trial in HS currently ongoing. The primary endpoint will be assessed after 12 weeks of treatment with patients then being followed for an additional 24 weeks. Using the FDA validated hidradenitis suppurativa clinical response or HiSCR score, key secondary endpoints in the trial include things like skin pain, quality of life, and other metrics of importance to HS patients. Our aspirational goal is to complete patient enrollment of AURORA this year. We will use our experience from the ADVOCATE trial where enrollment rates were unprecedentedly swift to focus on site activation and accelerate the rate at which patients come in to the AURORA trial. Finally for the avacopan pipeline in a drug strategy, let's move to our third ongoing trial with avacopan in C3 glomerulopathy or C3G. C3G is a rare and terrible kidney disease that strikes the young. There are no FDA approved therapies for C3G. We have an ongoing trial with avacopan in C3G a trial which we believe is the most definitive clinical trial in the C3G space. Last year, taking the advice of experts in the community and availing ourselves of newly published data, we expanded our original C3 trial design to now encompass 88 patients in two strata and using a randomized controlled design as you can see in Slide 8. Enrollment across this trial is now approaching 50% of the overall 88-patient target. While technically a Phase II study, we designed the trial to potentially support registration discussions with agencies of avacopan and C3G if we achieve a positive primary endpoint. This endpoint will be assessed using a renal histology index at six months of therapy and we will compare the histology from the avacopan therapy group to that in the group receiving the empirically derived standard of care alone. All of these approaches in our trials at a mechanistic level are quite different and we believe better than others in the complement intervention space. For example, avacopan is unique in its selective targeting of the C5a receptor. Avacopan leaves all other components of the bodies complement cascade intact, so they can do their job. As you can see by looking at the diagram on Slide 9, this may confer significant advantages to avacopan therapy in at least three clearly differentiated ways. First, avacopan's mechanism of action is downstream in the complement cascade, completely avoiding the biological consequences that can follow therapeutic intervention further upstream. Second, avacopan precisely targets the C5a receptor, and while that snuffs out the activation of C5a \u2013 C5a receptor driven disease causing neutrophils, it leaves the C5b-9 defense mechanism intact. Third, and some may ignore this at their peril, avacopan preserves the beneficial functions of the second C5a receptor, the so-called C5L2 pathway. Even the closest competing mechanistic approaches in the complement intervention space are nowhere near as specific as our orally administered C5a receptor inhibitor, which we specifically designed to avoid the complications of inhibiting other parts of the pathway, including the beneficial activities of the second C5a pathway through C5L2. No one else can make that claim. Importantly, I'll stress again that avacopan is a small molecule, which is orally administered, making it convenient for patients and therefore potentially improving its chances of uptake and compliance once approved. Our plans for the avacopan pipeline into drug strategy are summarized clearly in the next slide, Slide 10 and I think it is a most exciting value creating proposition for both patients and investors alike. Keen observers note, correctly, I think that we have a succession of three major readouts of data planned starting later this year with avacopan and ANCA vasculitis, where avacopan could certainly revolutionize the current treatment paradigm and followed the following year by C3G and HS data readouts. Before I turn to our robust financial situation, let me give you a brief update on the good progress with another of our unique small molecule assets, the CCR2 inhibitor known as CCX140. Building on the extensive safety and efficacy data from our previously successfully completed Phase II trial of CCX140 in diabetic chronic kidney disease, our LUMINA trials represented or referred to on Slides 11 and 12 assessed CCX140 in the rare debilitating kidney disease of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis or FSGS for which there is no approved treatment. The LUMINA trials involved two subpopulations of patients with primary FSGS as depicted in Slide 12, which are actively now enrolling in parallel. The first subpopulation, patients with so called sub-nephrotic syndrome is more than 50% enrolled. The second population running in parallel is in a quite rare population of patients with so-called nephrotic syndrome and we have enrolled two of the first six patients planned for group one. Although, we may roughly double that target if the initial results in the first six look promising. 2018 was a great year for execution, across our sweeping pipeline program at CCXI. 2019 promises to be even more exciting. There are multiple growth drivers as you can see some of them outlined on Slide 15 \u2013 Slide 13 rather, giving us some potentially amazing prospects over the next 18 months or so and beginning in Q4. As I mentioned, we expect a cadence of topline readouts starting with the Phase III ADVOCATE trial in Q4 of this year, followed next year by avacopan in C3G and then the AURORA trial of avacopan in Hidradenitis Suppurativa. And then these results will be followed by or possibly accompanied by the LUMINA trial data of CCX140 in FSGS. Also in 2020, we plan to file submissions with the FDA and EMA for avacopan in the treatment of ANCA vasculitis. Don't forget that our powerful drug discovery and basic science clinical support platform is underlying all of this. This platform is like a finely tuned engine, humming along behind the scenes, powering the enterprise. Our science and discovery platform continues to create value, identifying novel modes of action of our late-stage pipeline assets, such as avacopan and CCX140, while also moving forward towards additional novel pipeline candidates in renal and dermal diseases and indeed beyond. I will conclude here by reminding us that CCXI possesses 100% of the rights for all of our drug candidates in the United States. For avacopan and CCX140, we have licensed the international commercial rights upon approval to our world-class partner, Vifor Pharma, who will pay us milestone payments for progress and who will also pay tiered royalties between the teens and the mid-20s on any aggregate net sales in their territories. I'll turn the call now over to Susan with the observation that our financial position is very strong as Susan will explain in a moment. We ended 2018 with $177 million and have already taken in another $20 million this year. Susan? Susan Kanaya : Thank you, Tom. Our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial results are included in our press release today and are summarized on Slide 14. Revenue was $9.3 million for the fourth quarter compared to $56.3 million for the same period in 2017. For the full-year ended December 31, 2018, revenue was $42.9 million compared to $82.5 million in the previous year. The decrease in revenue reflected the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard ASC 606. Research and development expenses were $15.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $12.9 million for the same period in 2017. For 2018 as a whole, R&D expenses rose to $62.7 million from $49.5 million in 2017, primarily due to the advancement and enrollment completion of our Phase III ADVOCATE trial and the initiation and patient enrollment of our avacopan Phase II clinical trials in patients with C3G and HS, and the CCX140 Phase II LUMINA trials in patients with FSGS. General and administrative expenses were $5.6 million for the fourth quarter compared to $4.1 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Full-year 2018 G&A expenses increased to $20.4 million from $16.5 million in 2017, primarily due to higher employee related expenses, including those associated with our commercialization efforts and higher professional fees. We recorded a net loss for the fourth quarter of $10.8 million compared to net income of $39.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our full-year 2018 net loss was $38 million compared to net income of $17.9 million in 2017. Total shares outstanding at December 31, 2018 were approximately 50.7 million shares. As Tom stated, we ended 2018 with $177 million in reported cash and investment. Additionally, in January, 2019, we added another $20 million to our reserves through the issuance of common stock from our equity distribution agreement. Lastly, we expect to utilize cash and investments in the range of $75 million to $85 million in 2019. Tom? Thomas Schall : Thank you, Susan. To summarize, as you can see from Slide 15, 2018 was an outstanding year of execution on ambitious goals, completing enrollments in ADVOCATE, making great progress in our trials of avacopan in C3G, and CCX140 and FSGS, and launching our AURORA trial of avacopan in HS. Our track record of execution makes us very confident that we will continue to achieve on our 2019 goals and start a wonderful sequence of topline data readouts in no fewer than four late stage clinical trials. Our financial strength also gives us the fuel we need to run these trials simultaneously and to work on full licensing submissions in the Europe and United States for avacopan in ANCA-associated vasculitis as we continue to plan for commercialization of these products in the United States. In short, we are entering an unprecedented era of opportunity, full of potential for patients, clinicians, and the investors that we serve. With that, I will now turn the call back over to the operator and look forward to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michelle Gilson of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Lina Kaminski : Thank you. Hi, congrats on the progress. This is Lina here on for Michelle. So maybe the first question, maybe you can talk a little bit about the PK/PD profile that avacopan has demonstrated in clinical trials in ANCA and in healthy volunteers? And then maybe you can dig a little bit and specifically into the PD data and biomarkers that suggest there\u2019s an effect on neutrophils and whether you see \u2013 if you can also basically relate these data to what we know about Hidradenitis Suppurativa pathogenesis and whether you believe that these biomarker data are enough to suggest that you can see a read through to your Phase II trials from clinical data of an anti-C5a approach in HS? And then I have a follow-on. Thomas Schall : Sure, of course. All very relevant questions, really great question. So we know from our data when we measure the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship of avacopan that essentially we're achieving a target which we set out long ago, which was to make C5a receptor bearing sales particularly blood neutrophils, which are the most abundant and probably the easiest to measure and probably it's the neutrophil driving most of the damage processes in the diseases that we're interested in as they respond to C5a through the C5a receptor. So we've done a lot of work to make those cells essentially pharmacologically inert to C5a in the body even when the drug avacopan is at its lowest levels throughout the day. We started those studies in healthy volunteers, where we perfected certain methodologies to look in whole blood, which is quite difficult to do it actually. Whole blood functions of neutrophils and their ability to change in response to the drug, that's the pharmacodynamic part. So those changes include the ability of those neutrophils to migrate in response to C5a, the ability of those cells to adhere and up regulate their adhesion molecule notably CD11b for those of you, who are aficionados of this area. And the ability of the neutrophils to spit out disruptive mediators reactive oxygen intermediates, as well as other enzymes from the granules of neutrophil, so neutrophil degranulation. If a neutrophil is inhibited in any of those functions and certainly all of those functions, it will be inhibited in the body from finding its target and therefore damaging its target in the real world. So our PK-PD relationship assessments beginning first in animals but then going to humans, first healthy volunteers where some of the data has been published, and then later data in patients, where the are data yet to be fully published, but have been discussed, really shows that we can even at trough levels of the drug that is the lowest level of the drug during the course of the day, we can essentially with avacopan ablate the ability of the neutrophils to migrate at anything like the physiological or pathophysiology concentration at C5a. We can absolutely stop the neutrophil from degranulating and producing destructive reactive oxygen intermediates in response to C5a, once a person has been dosed with avacopan. And they certainly do not up regulate their adhesion molecule CD11B, which \u2013 all of which means the neutrophils when activated or attempting to be activated by C5a and C5a dysregulated conditions such as ANCA vasculitis or Hidradenitis Suppurativa. Those neutrophils won't stick to the tissue, the blood vessels, they won't degranulate and they won't migrate, they won't bring in more neutrophils to do this destructive process. So we have achieved our goal of making C5a receptor pharmacologically inert in human beings. We've shown that the levels of drug even at the trough the lowest level of the day, we can accomplish this. So this has been a very nicely depicted in data both talked about in international meetings some of it's been published. In humans \u2013 I'm sorry in patients rather going beyond healthy humans, patients who have taken the drug longer tend to even get higher levels of C5a receptor inhibitor avacopan in their body. So there is even more drug around even at trough to essentially make the cells bearing C5a receptor pharmacologically inert 24 hours a day. There are things that avacopan does not do, it does not cause a buildup of C5a in the body. This is biologically impossible in any case. It doesn't cost C5a to accumulate inside cells, it doesn't cause a huge change in the amount of C5a receptors on a given cell. But even if it did, we'd still have vast excesses of the drug to cover that, that change in receptor. And it doesn't importantly impede the beneficial effects of the second C5a receptor C5L2, which we and others have shown as a protective effect at least in the disease models most relevant to what we are treating in the human clinic. So the PK-PD looks very, very clear for avacopan. We've shown it in actual human beings, who have taken the drug and tested their blood neutrophils before and after dosing and essentially provided good evidence, excellent evidence in fact for everything that I just discussed in terms of those relationships. The net effect is, those neutrophils cannot respond to C5a through the C5a receptor to do their destructive damage. They're not immunosuppressed, however, these neutrophils can still do other functions if needed. So that's another important differentiating point. So we know \u2013 we've used that very carefully when we started predicting our doses to go even earlier in to studies, some years ago in ANCA vasculitis and those predictions from all of those models and the healthy volunteers turned out to be very applicable to ANCA vasculitis patients. We've done some work in those patient population, that work continues, and we see no material differences between patients and healthy volunteers, other than the drug tends to accumulate not unexpected over time to a modest degree, which was predicted, and therefore, provides us even greater drug coverage on the target the C5a receptor. This seems to apply as well and so far as anyone can tell to what's happening in other indications where complement dysregulated neutrophils are driven by complement C5a to create their destructive effects like in Hidradenitis Suppurativa. To the extent that anyone can tell, there is lots of complement activation including C5a presence, doesn't seem to be extraordinary beyond other disorders like ANCA. There is certainly more activated neutrophils around responding through C5a receptor, but again, there's only so much capacity. So they seem to be very similar to their neutrophils in ANCA vasculitis and other diseases. Therefore, again, extrapolating from our clinical experience and our vast amount of preclinical modeling in vivo, we believe that the way to treat HS with avacopan is not the similar than the way we treated another complement dysregulated neutrophil driven like ANCA and so that's what we're doing in the AURORA trial 390 patients. So I think that covers most of the questions you are asking, if I missed one let me know. Lina Kaminski : No. This is great. I was just also wondering in terms of HS landscape, maybe you can talk a little bit about where do you think avacopan would fit in based on the profile that you described and based on what you've seen with the C5a and C5 mechanisms? Thomas Schall : Sure. Thank you. We've only \u2013 the world is only seen a little bit of data on C5a in this disease and that data is compelling. So far we have essentially 14 patients at a single site. The proof-of-concept there was with an antibody, a chimeric antibody meaning it's got a lot of mouse content apparently, and it's a once-a-week infusion antibody. So there are some things to deal with there going forward for development. The contrast for us is we are an orally active molecule were taken in a capsule form, can take it at home and you take it daily. So there maybe \u2013 there's already differences in the mechanism \u2013 the mode of administration, the mechanism of action again is an antibody versus a small molecule. And the other approach takes away C5a from the C5L2, which we believe and others believe is actually a beneficial pathway. We don't know what readout that might have in Hidradenitis Suppurativa. In models of ANCA vasculitis, it\u2019s very clear that C5L2 disruption leads to worse disease, C5aR inhibition including with avacopan virtually eliminates the disease in ANCA vasculitis models, which have been done very carefully. So not all those differences notwithstanding, I think there's great enthusiasm for the idea of C5a\u2019s involvement in HS, since you're asking specifically about HS, and the fact again that it is probably being driven through neutrophils, which are driven through the C5a receptor, the proinflammatory part of C5a pathway. So we believe again that should these data hold up in larger controlled trials including our trial, the AURORA trial, then having an orally active drug should be a big advantage in that patient population. I know there's another sponsor using that antibody who will be reading out some Phase II data in the first controlled setting, I believe fairly shortly. So we all wait eagerly what that data will tell us. Assuming they find a dose and a response from that study that will be interesting. We believe we already have a dose for complement-activated neutrophil-driven diseases, that's how we've designed the AURORA trial. So our trial is very large randomized controlled trial and powered to be of registration grade. So that's where we are. How all this will ultimately fit together? Believe me, there's plenty of opportunity in this landscape across these diseases and I believe there's room for all innovations. I happen to believe that we have the most differentiated and advantageous approach ultimately. Lina Kaminski : Thank you. May I ask another one, promise last one. Maybe you can talk a little bit about ADVOCATE trial specifically about the baseline characteristics? And are you seeing any trends that can indicate that some patients would be less likely to respond to standard of care? And how are you accounting for discontinuation in the study? And maybe a little bit about the powering of the study? Thomas Schall : I can comment on some of that. First I'm going to say that obviously ADVOCATE is ongoing. We have still patients that are being dosed in ADVOCATE. It is all still blinded. So I really have intentionally not looked even at the blinded data to find out if there seem to be any ideas coming out of baseline data characteristics even in blinded trends. So I simply don't have that data. I will say this though, from what I do know about baseline characteristics, it appears to represent the patient population around the world, which I think is not unexpected since it's a global trial. And in terms of how this drug works, remember what we're trying to do here. We are inhibiting the neutrophil from doing its ultimate destruction. So in ANCA vasculitis, you have auto-antibodies against your neutrophils, and in our view the auto-antibodies themselves are not necessarily the problem. They do get the neutrophils sort of semi activated or primed. But it's clear, again from very careful genetic and model data, at least in animals that the ultimate culprit is C5a receptor. It is both necessary and sufficient. It seems to be the lethal agents in this cascade. That's what we're blocking. So irrespective of ideas, and there are some ideas in the world that one form of ANCA vasculitis is a little bit more difficult to treat than another form and may relapse more frequently, et cetera, et cetera. Frankly, a priori, we don't really much care about that because we're targeting how the neutrophil actually inflames the blood vessel and eventually destroys it. So I personally did not in our model take into account, whether or not you have one form or the other, so called MPO, GPA versus MPA disease for example. So to me, our mechanism should work equivalently on both. We're representing the population of ANCA in our trial and we should be able to determine, I think quite definitively if the drug has activity across this patient population as well as of course looking at the pre-specified subgroup analyses that take into account some of these other factors. So \u2013 but there should be no surprises in the distribution of the patient population in ADVOCATE. And to the extent that in Phase II, we had a representative patient population and I believe we did between the CLEAR and the CLASSIC trial. Again, we didn't see anything that stood out dramatically from those data as we've reported before in terms of responses. In terms of differences in efficacy I should say. Lina Kaminski : Thank you so much. Thank you for answering my questions and congrats again on great quarter and great progress of the year. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Lina. Appreciate your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Seedhouse of Raymond James. Your line is open. Steven Seedhouse : Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. First thing I wanted to ask about was just the importance of impacting pain in Hidradenitis Suppurativa. So Humira improved pain in only one of their two Phase III studies and there's some evidence now that IL-1 alpha antagonism can reduce pain as well. When you look at complement inhibition in this disease with avacopan, does it make sense mechanistically that you would reduce pain? And do you think that pain reduction is just a secondary result of improving the lesions or is it a different ideology I guess in and off itself? Thomas Schall : Yes, that's a beautiful question, and it starts to eliminate some beautiful and intricate biology I think. So what we do know is this, all of these mediators seem to ultimately talk to each other to some degree. So for example, we and others have shown certainly in vitro experiments that inhibition of C5a receptor can diminish the production of TNF and IL-1 in cell culture experiments and that\u2019s not a new observation. I think this has been shown in one form or another for a long time. And it used to be thought that IL-1 and TNF were upstream of some of these other mediators, but I think it's more of a network. So the mechanism of the pain reduction is simply not entirely clear at the direct level. To the extent that it will occur, and I believe it will occur as it exemplified by TNF and IL-1 results today. I do think there's a good chance that this will read through with C5a receptor. And in fact, we know that C5a interestingly does have some effects on nervous system tissue directly. There's plenty of results in the literature that suggest that. So let's just say this, whenever you do a clinical trial, while it's important to build models, so you can build the right endpoints, I think you have to be open-minded. But to the extent that it would not surprise me, if we saw a reduction in pain, maybe both directly with C5a receptor antagonism, but certainly indirectly as the inflammatory cascade gets damped down and we go from a smoldering fire to maybe some embers that are just banking, that wouldn't surprise me in the least. And I think that we should definitely look very carefully at that parameter as we come out of the trial. It's built into the HS secondary endpoints that we're looking at. Steven Seedhouse : Okay. Thank you. And this recent IL-1 alpha antibody bermekimab, this HS study was in 42 patients, but I guess eight patients dropped out before completing the study and the protocol used on Last Observation Carried Forward or LOCF analysis to handle those dropouts. And when you look back at a Humira Phase III, I mean they use that, but it was a sensitivity analysis. The primary analysis there was a non-response imputation. So can you just clarify in your Phase II are you using LOCF in the primary analysis? Or will the dropouts be considered non-responders obviously it could affect the response rates. Thomas Schall : Yes. Steve, it doesn't surprise me that some of the anti-L1 folks dropped out. There's a long history of some issues with the approach with anti IL-1 as you know, or IL-1 receptor antagonists. So yes, it can be a pretty dicey thing. Let me say this, we haven't talked about all the details of how we're going to analyze HS. But as I mentioned before, it's a 390 patients study. We designed it with the both statistical power and other approaches to be essentially a registration grade trial. So I think you can infer from that information that we will use the appropriate statistical analysis to make sure that we are sort of the Phase III grade analysis. And I think obviously with that amount of \u2013 and we will certainly have the power to detect the signals we need to. Steven Seedhouse : Okay, thanks. And just last thing quickly on enrollment velocity of that study. Can you say how many centers are online and how many patients you've treated so far in HS? Thomas Schall : Well, let me put it this way, we have patients randomized in this study. We're still getting our sites up and running. I'm going to report on more details on that next quarter. But these trials \u2013 there's a lot of pent-up demand in this patient population and these trials, as you may know, can enroll very rapidly. So we're seeing \u2013 let's just say we're seeing a significant amount of enthusiasm. So when I mentioned that our aspirational goal is to get the trial enrolled or certainly largely enrolled this year, it's certainly based on some data that we have. So I'll fill in some more numbers as we go into the next quarter and get more sites up and running. Steven Seedhouse : Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks for taking my questions. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dae Gon Ha of SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Dae Gon Ha : Yes. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking our questions. So just wanted to follow-up on the HS, the AURORA trial question. Tom, just wanted to get your take on, given the pent-up demand and obviously your colleagues are about to get done with their trial. So I would imagine there's even more of an influx of interest. How are you thinking about and how are you planning about balancing rapidity of enrollment, but also quality of output? Specifically, can you comment on maybe site overlap between the SHINE study and the AURORA study that's going on with yours? And then the other question with regards to HS, can you also remind us on what the estimated breakdown is within the prevalence of moderate to severe HS, how early stages two and three take up? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Thomas Schall : Yes. So I can certainly address some of those items Dae Gon. Thank you for the questions. Again, without going into too many specific details, clearly there is some overlap in sites between SHINE and AURORA. That would only be expected. But there's actually quite a large number of sites and qualified sites that won't overlap, and you'll see that again as we go forward through the trial, but particularly as we start reading out the information. What I will say is this, the investigator community in HS has become \u2013 they're amazingly aligned and their desire to come up with new therapies. They became very much coalesced around the previous PIONEER result and how PIONEER was done. They've contributed greatly to understanding and all becoming as standardized as possible in how trial readouts and trial assessments need to be done with such things as the HiSCR or high score. They've also contributed fundamentally to quality of life indices and in a very meaningful way. So the HiSQOL for example is something that really has come out of a marvelous community effort in the HS investigator community. I think all of that's by way of saying that because there hasn't been that much for this patient population for a long time, these folks are really focused and they're all plugged in and trying to make sure that they do standardized their assessments across their field. We go beyond that of course, and some of these folks have contributed in our trial, have been in PIONEER, they\u2019ve been in SHINE. So they know fundamentally what they're doing. And obviously there even in a new field, there is a cadre of KOLs and we all appeal to them. Beyond that, we've been very careful in this trial as we have with many other trials. And one advantage of ChemoCentryx is we've been in the clinical trials business for quite some years. So we've run big trials all over the world and we've learned a lot of good lessons from that experience in different indications. So we're really taking a lot of time for training, standardization, centralized assessments, and even adjudications were appropriate in some of these metrics. So we fundamentally believe we'll get high quality data, even though we will have not inconsiderable number of sites in this trial. But this is a switched on community. They're highly trained. They're all focused on how to get good readouts for HS. It's not trivial as you know, but I think that we're getting the advantage of some other efforts and we're right there on the riding the crest of that wave. So I believe that we'll be able to really get very good quality data. So that's essentially how we're controlling for the variability. You had a second question, which I've forgotten now. Sorry about that. Dae Gon Ha : Yes. No problem. So it's just the breakdown of early stages two and three within the moderate to severe patient? Thomas Schall : Yes. Thank you. So the data for HS is staggeringly inconsistent, somewhat confusing. But I think we and others can speak with some authority at least generally. If we don't go to breaking down the categories that discreetly, but we can certainly speak with some confidence about Hurley II and III as a category of moderate to severe. And so I think the data are pretty good. And as you know, here in the U.S., orphan drug designation has been given to for Humira, adalimumab for Hurley II, III. So I worked on that because we're also keen on getting that designation. We've been very successful in orphan drug designations with avacopan and other indications. We've done a lot of work on this. So suffice it to say, I'm pretty convinced that moderate to severe Hurley II, III in the U.S. is an orphan designation. It's probably fewer \u2013 it is fewer than 200,000. And the numbers between 150,000 and 180,000 are not unmeaningful based on the very best data to-date that we can glean from a variety of sources. So that's the prevalence data. It's harder to breakdown farther than that I think with any credibility. So I won't do so here. And then the question is how many patients will you be able to capture in that prevalent population? The answer is no one yet knows. But suffice it to say that again, when you look into the data for Humira, it's actually quite surprising how few scripts are written for that indication. And yet, as I mentioned, I think everyone's best estimate is about $1 billion worldwide for HS. So maybe the answer there is you don't need to \u2013 you don't need to get, but a reasonable fraction, not a huge fraction of that that prevalent population to still make a great return for that drug. Our goal obviously is to get patient relief in the broadest number we can. So we're going to definitely take a hard look at that 150,000 and 180,000 in the U.S. and figure out how to do that. Dae Gon Ha : Okay. And then just quickly my last question is on FSGS LUMINA trials. Just given the cadence of events and I guess the pace of enrollment seems to be quicker in LUMINA-1, I just wanted to get your take on, is the next trial contingent on both trials completing? And what are your thoughts on maybe looking at some other podocytopathies or proteinuric renal diseases? Thanks again. Thomas Schall : Yes. Thank you, Dae Gon. So those trials are independent entities, neither of them depend really on the other to move forward. The nephrotic syndrome was attractive to us because the FDA has given pretty clear guidance, guidance with a small G anyway, that if one can really significantly reduced the proteinuria in that population even in a fairly small number of people because their prognosis is so bad. There's really a great and serious discussion to be had about a registration in nephrotic syndrome. They have been a little more circumspect around what it would take beyond proteinuria, if anything, to get a registration in the sub-nephrotic population. So that's our LUMINA-1 population, nephrotic populations LUMINA-2. But if regulators and therefore the rest of us treat these as kind of two separate labels or two separate indications, so either can go forward on its own. And probably \u2013 well nephrotic syndrome is obviously a lot, lot more rare. So that's why the numbers is aimed for quite a bit smaller. Podocytopathy, I love the general idea of podocytopathy. As you may recall, and I alluded to it in my remarks, we ran a successful one-year long trial of CCX140 in diabetic chronic kidney disease. We showed a fairly rapid and durable lowering of proteinuria with CCR2 inhibition by CCX140 above and beyond what could be achieved just with standard of care alone. We added it on top of standard of care and showed a delta that was robust and consistent. So then we just pivoted to FSGS is another form of chronic kidney disease, one which was more tractable and one for which proteinuria lowering could conceivably result in at least a conditional license, and certainly a discussion with regulators about how to get the drug approved based on that end point. So although that was to the good and in the background, as I mentioned in the close of my remarks, people should not forget. We do science here at ChemoCentryx. It's very, very \u2013 sometimes very basic, but always to the purpose of supporting the drug. So either creating a new drug, which obviously CCX140 and avacopan were new some years ago, they came out of our pipeline, we invented them here. But once we have those molecules, there's a lot of mechanism questions that come out of clinical data. And so no one really understands. And I think we understand now why CCR2 inhibition in the kidney leads to such a rapid and profound reduction of proteinuria, both in animals, mice and in man, but it happens \u2013 it happens reproducibly. And it happens with other mechanisms that when people tie up to ligand for CCR2 for example. They saw similar effects some years ago in a Phase II study. And the reason it happens is because we think, anyway, we've shown now and we discussed this at American Society of Nephrology meeting last autumn, CCR2 is uniquely express probably on a population of stress podocytes [themselves]. And maybe when it's expressed and engaged, it's contributing fundamentally to the acute podocytopathy going back to the direct part of your question. It may even be on a population of podocyte precursor cells or podocyte stem cells coming out of the bone marrow and we've shown that with some very elegant genetic experiments and bone marrow transfers. Those two populations are in addition to the normal textbook kind of inflammatory macrophages, which are also resident in the glomerulus. All that's by way of saying, I think you're right. I think this target will be really interesting in other podocytopathies. We're looking very carefully at that and we may well expand the 140 indication spectrum to include some of those podocytopathies. So yes, watch this space. Very good question. Dae Gon Ha : Great. Thanks again for taking the questions and congrats on the progress. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Dae Gon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ted Tenthoff of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Edward Tenthoff : Thank you very much for taking my questions. Tom, I always learn at least two or three things when I listen to you talk about this topic, really fascinating, and I love how you described the discovery engine as a well-oiled machine. So I'm excited to see what comes out of that well-oiled machine. Question if I may on \u2013 actually two, one housekeeping for Susan. With respect to the shares that were issued, can you give a sense of what number that was or what's the average price was during the offering in January? Thank you. Susan Kanaya : Of course. Thank you, Ted. So the $20 million that we issued was roughly 1.6 million, 1.7 million shares at $12 a share. Edward Tenthoff : Great. And then Tom for you, so looking forward, obviously a lot of clinical updates coming, really exciting time next year as a company kind of such a transition into a commercial company. What really has to be done, obviously dependent on data, obviously dependent on regulatory outcome, but what really are sort of the steps you start to make to think about the commercial opportunity in the U.S.? Thanks very much for taking the questions. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Ted. Those steps are already well underway here. And as you know, we\u2019re really becoming aware of what the market is. We are doing a lot of with professional organizations and through the team that we've hired here to do this work in house, looking a lot into how these patients are actually treated, where they actually present. I'm talking about ANCA vasculitis now for the moment. Really what are the metrics that patient \u2013 behind how the patients are treated and what's the patient journey look like. So that whole buying process is a big thing. We're laying out \u2013 then from that we start to conclude whoever going to need to actually sell this drug actively. Clearly, we went into this. I often talk about our renal franchise. Some people correctly point out to me and they asked me, its ANCA vasculitis, it doesn't have renal in the name of the disease. Absolutely, true, it's a systemic vasculitis. It happens to be that the kidney is acquisitively sensitive. So anywhere up to 75% or 80% of people over the history of their disease will manifest renal consequences. And those tend to be very expensive, obviously if they go into end stage renal disease, et cetera, and even deadly. So we do think of it as a renal disease, but in addition to nephrologist, this is treated by rheumatologists and frequently lung manifestations are the other big problems. So we're learning more and more about ANCA vasculitis, where it presents? How it presents? I won't go into all the details today, but it's kind of eye opening. So that whole research process and the data it's yielding is telling us about how we need to think about fielding the correct type of salesforce, the right mix of reps versus MSLs and so on and how big that force looks. All of that work is absolutely going on in background. Certainly, a lot of work in the U.S., there's a lot of work in Europe talking to various at least the sort of pre-discussions with various health authorities in the various jurisdictions. So yes, that stuff is going on and we're taking it very seriously and we know we have. We have enough time to get it right and we're already putting a big effort into it in background. So its way beyond what we \u2013 we talked a lot about the clinical progress. I allude to the purring machine, the purring engine there behind the scenes. But this is another part of that engine, which is fascinating stuff and we've hired some really experienced and excellent people to get it done. So that's going on in background. And of course there's all the parallel path of making sure the submission packages for the various licenses, [NDA] process and so on, that's also happening here in ChemoCentryx again with a whole group of people that we brought in last year. So it's an exciting time of growth in the company. Edward Tenthoff : Perfect, and of course, I don't mean to put the cart in front of the horse here. The regulatory, the clinical data and the regulatory will come first. One other quick question, if I may. I know you retain rights in China. What are your high level thinking about how to bridge that large, but difficult market? Thanks. Thomas Schall : Yes. No, that's great. Probably when we last talked about that we had retained the rights in China, since then Ted, what we've done is our friends at Vifor International were so keen on getting those China rights. I mean we were in discussion with the number of players to really figure out what to do in China. Ultimately, we gave Vifor the China rights to avacopan and CCX140. We got some money upfront for those rights, about $21.5 million or $22 million as I recall. But more important than that \u2013 and that was fine, but more important than that was the sales on those two assets will now accrue to the aggregate or cumulative sales in the Vifor territories. And as you know, we get really lovely royalties off the topline of aggregate sales from their territories, as I mentioned in my remarks, ranging from the teens to the mid-20s based on sales tiers. So China could contribute when \u2013 so now you have to ask the question of Vifor, but eventual sales in China will contribute to reaching different sales goals in aggregate and their territory is conceivably taking us into other tiers. And so the cumulative effect of that deal I think in the end was spectacular for us. And I know that was meaningful for Vifor who\u2019re very keen to be able to start thinking about how they're going to establish themselves in that part of the world as well. Edward Tenthoff : Cool. Thanks for [indiscernible] missed that. Thanks for the update guys. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Ted. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed White of H.C. Wainwright. Your line is open. Edward White : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions guys. So just a couple of quick things on the AURORA trial. First of all with the topline data expected in the middle of 2020, is that going to include only the 12-week data or will we see some of the follow-up data on the patients for those additional 24 weeks? And then also, Tom, you mentioned in the past many times that you have had the HS study is powered to be registrational grade study, but have you actually had discussions with the FDA regarding this study as registrational in nature? And I just have a follow-up for Susan later. Thomas Schall : Sure. So what we're committing to on the topline data is the 12-week data right now. So we'll commit to that topline primary endpoint data. And again we aspire to get there in 2020, if we can get this trial mostly enrolled in 2019, and hopefully or earlier the better. But again, we'll keep you on taste with updates on that through this year based on enrollment. But yes, that's our commitment right now is the 12-week topline data. Obviously the follow-up data will be in process as well around the same time, but we want to make sure we talk about the 12-week as soon as we can. This conversations with the agency, we have had certain conversations. Let's just say for the moment we're trying to first get our orphan drug application approved. And so once we have that application, I think I'll be willing to say a lot more about where we may or may not be with the discussion with regulators. I suffice it to say that this trial is big. It's a very mature asset. Obviously it's a Phase III asset in other indications. So all of that up the benefits of the experience and the safety database and so on and so forth, certainly are not \u2013 they are certainly not harming our cause in that respect. But we just need to \u2013 it remains to be seen. And of course, I think the agency will be hesitant to commit to any study of being a Phase III prior to seeing the data and of course, prior to ascertaining whether or not we're in an orphan space with this particular asset. So I'll have more to say about that as we go through that process this year. Edward White : Okay, great. Thanks Tom. And then just for Susan, considering the $177 million, again the year with plus the $20 million raise in January. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the cash runway. Is this enough to get to launch with the potential Vifor milestones? Susan Kanaya : Sure. So I think that's a great question, Ed. I mean I think $177 million before the $20 million put this in very strong position. We've been consistent in providing guidance that it gets us through the multiple data readouts, including ADVOCATE, C3G, HS as well as the FSGS programs. So with anticipated filing in 2021 that wouldn't be too unreasonable, but that's about as far as we're actually projecting at the moment. Edward White : Okay, great. Thanks Susan. Susan Kanaya : Sure. Anytime. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Anupam Rama of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tessa Romero : Hi. This is Tessa filling in for Anupam this evening. Thanks for taking the questions and for the updates here. Maybe as we look towards the Phase III ADVOCATE readout later this year, perhaps a housekeeping question. Can you guide us to what we will see in the topline in 4Q? And what we will have to wait for in follow-up presentations? And then secondly, one on AURORA, apologies if I missed this earlier, but can you remind us of what type of reduction in high score you are looking for at 12 weeks both on a relative and an absolute basis? Thanks so much guys. Thomas Schall : Certainly. So with the ADVOCATE data, obviously we'll be looking at the topline data from the primary endpoint of BVAS. So you'll hear the BVAS scores and the comparison between the standard of care arm and the avacopan arm for both week-26 and week-52. We hope to be able also to release the topline data on the quality of life assessments using the validated instruments that we employed similarly in the Phase II CLEAR trial. We will be giving readout on parameters that read to the preservation of organ function, including renal parameters. So we used to look for things like proteinuria values, proteinuria reduction over the course of the trial. Look for eGFR, look for things like the shedding of kidney inflammatory markers in the urine such as MCP-1 to creatinine ratios. Again, those were presented in the Phase II study and we've similarly built our plan to analyze them here. And then we will hope to be able to talk about vascular damage index and glucocorticoid toxicity and the delta between the groups. So that's a pretty ambitious slate. We hope to be able to achieve most of it, but at minimum you should look to BVAS scores and some of the objective lab readouts, which we'll be able to analyze I think in the time period that we've assessed. And certainly we'll speak to the overall efficacy of the drug and whether the data mirror what we saw in the Phase II study. In terms of the HiSCR score, we did a lot of modeling based on the TNF studies before. I think that we've been looking again to be able to at least detect the kind of signal at 12 weeks that was manifest in the largest spread for adalimumab in the PIONEER studies, and that should be handily achieved I think with the power that we have in our HS study. So you could use that as a sort of benchmark, and again, we'll have more details as we go forward on those readouts, but we should very handily be able to see those kinds of deltas. Tessa Romero : Okay. Thanks very much Tom. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Tessa. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Harshita Polishetty. Your line is open. Harshita Polishetty : Hey, Tom and Susan. Congrats on the progress and thank you for the detailed update on the late-stage programs. Most of my questions have been answered, but I have a quick one on your small molecule PD-1 inhibitor program, if I may. I understand it's very early on in the process, but could you provide some color on CCX4503 and how that addresses the challenges seen with developing small molecule antagonists, I guess with regard to targeting the highly hydrophobic PD-1/PD-L1 interaction surface? Thank you. Thomas Schall : Yes, that's great. Thank you, Harshita. It's been a while since we had questions about that beautiful discovery engine we have. Our medicinal chemistry here is so excellent. I love to tell the world that, and this is another example. So as you know, antibodies are clearly ruling the risk with the PD-1/PD-L1 area as with many of the other checkpoint inhibitors. And for good reasons, these are fairly large protein interactions, and you're right, certain challenges like some of these hydrophobic packets and so on that get in the way of trying to really mediate disruptive interaction with small molecule have been daunting. Our guys have cracked this, at least, at certain levels, and our ultimate goal is to crack it in fact with orally active compounds. And we have made great progress. As you know, we published some data on the 4503 molecule or, at least, presented some at a meeting last autumn. I think it was very well received and certainly got a lot of people interested. And now we've even take \u2013 we've taken some steps further. We hope to be able to talk about those this year. Ultimately, as a business, we\u2019ll probably need to take forward some of these oncology assets in the context of a partnership for a variety of reasons. We're still fairly focused in terms of size obviously and focused on inflammatory disease. But this is really a thrilling set of developments here. And if one could truly get useful small molecules, and frankly 4503 is pretty good molecule, but I think we've got even some better ones now. Clearly some of the liabilities of protein-based checkpoint inhibitors might be overcome. And as you well know, as good as the checkpoint inhibitors are right now, they have liabilities or difficult to manage and the induction of autoimmune conditions with the checkpoint inhibitors is very common. They can be very serious. And the fact is you've got a long-lived antibody in the body, and certainly the biological half-life is quite extreme. If you could somehow manage that by dosing and titrating the dose carefully with a small molecule, one that wouldn't stick around quite so long as you were managing some of these other effects or could be given at massive pulsatile doses as you're trying to go for the therapeutic efficacy intermittently, it could be profoundly advantageous and usually valuable. So that's what we're working on, and we're going to talk a lot more about the details of some of that chemistry progress I hope this year at a number of big meetings. And we\u2019re going to try to get some papers published to detail a little bit more some of the questions you're asking. But it's very exciting. It's very exciting in background and I think it's going to have great value. And as I said, probably in terms of a business relationship, it will be carried forward in the context of what we hope will be a high value partnership. Harshita Polishetty : Great. Thanks, Tom. That's very helpful, and once again congrats on the progress. Thomas Schall : Thank you so much, Harshita. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Tom Schall for any closing remarks. Thomas Schall : Well, I just want to thank everyone for joining our call today. The discussion was very, very interesting and the questions were insightful, and I really look forward to updating you further as we go forward and then in weeks to come, and I very much look forward to talking with you at minimum at the next quarterly call. Thank you very much and have a great afternoon and evening. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker\u2019s prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Okay, thanks Ian. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining us today on our first quarter call. Special welcome to those who are new in their coverage of our company including Jay Olsen of Oppenheimer, Yaron Werber of Cowen, and Bill Kim of BMO. So we go into 2019 having put in place a strong track record of execution, and we are well prepared for the challenges and opportunities ahead. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO Bob Bradway, who will provide a strategic overview of our business and the environment we operate in. after Bob\u2019s comments, our CFO David Meline will review our financial results for the first quarter. Our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Murdo Gordon, will then review our product performance, following by our Head of R&D David Reese who will provide a pipeline update. We will use slides to guide our discussion today and you should have received a link separately. Just a reminder that we will use non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob Bradway : Thank you, Arvind, and let me add to Arvind\u2019s welcome to all of you joining the call today. We entered 2019 with a strong track record of execution and an improved ability to innovate, compete, and grow over the long term. We feel now well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities presented by our newer products in our pipeline, even as we effectively defend our mature products against emerging and expected new competition. As you know, drug prices are being challenged around the world, and we, therefore, have said for some time that we expect volume-driven growth to be important to our long-term success. And in Q1, we once again demonstrated our ability to grow unit volumes, especially for our newer products like Prolia, Repatha, and Aimovig, as well as for our six hematology/oncology products that are in early phases of their life cycle. I believe our performance outside of the US, where we have faced biosimilar competition for over a decade is instructive. There, our business generated 15% unit volume growth in the first quarter as growth of our newer products more than offset the erosion of our mature brands and biosimilar competition. We remain confident in the lifecycle management strategies we have in place to defend our mature brands, and we believe there is considerable upside potential with our newer products that will drive attractive long-term growth. As a leader in bone health with Prolia, we know that there's a need for an additional innovative therapy for women who are at high risk for fracture from postmenopausal osteoporosis. In Q1, we added Evenity to our portfolio of first in class innovative medicines with approvals in Japan and earlier this month in the US. Postmenopausal osteoporosis remains a highly underdiagnosed and undertreated disease with potentially devastating consequences from fractures, many of which are predictable and preventable. And we're excited to be at the forefront of offering innovative products to the millions of women worldwide who may benefit from them. I want to take a moment to highlight our biosimilars business, which we think represents a compelling opportunity to leverage our world-class biologics capabilities. This business is now annualizing at more than $200 million this year, with Kanjinti and Amgevita off to strong starts in Europe and select other international markets. We expect other launches this year and we see biosimilars making important contributions to our revenue profile moving forward, especially as pressure on our drug pricing creates increased demand for lower cost treatment options. Murdo will discuss our full product portfolio in some detail shortly. Looking to the future, we are rapidly advancing a robust pipeline of innovative medicines, many of which have the potential to be first in class or best-in-class therapies. In oncology alone, we're capitalizing on our industry-leading BiTE portfolio and targeted therapies across a number of important disease areas including multiple myeloma, AML, as well as various solid tumors. As, you know, oncology programs can move very rapidly from proof of concept to registration, and we're excited about what we're seeing. You'll hear more from Dave Reese on our pipeline in a moment. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow has enabled us to provide significant returns to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends, even as we invest in long-term, volume-driven growth opportunities around the world. Our financial strength also gives us the ability to consider a wide range of business development opportunities, consistent with our areas of strategic focus, while remaining disciplined to ensure we earn a solid return for shareholders. Let me just say a few words also about health care reform and drug pricing. Simply stated, we're in favor of policies that provide more patients with greater access to better health care, and we continue to work with the administration and Congress to advance policies that harness the competitive power of the marketplace, encourage innovation, and improve access to new therapies for patients. For example, we're supportive of the administration's proposal to move from back-end rebates to upfront discounts in order to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients. Even in the face of net price declines, as we experienced last year, patients are not seeing the benefits of rebates. In fact, out-of-pocket costs for patients have been rising in recent years, which underscores the need for the administration to move forward with its final rule. I want to just close with one final message, which is that we will build on our recent transformation successes and have the resources and determination to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us to meet our competitive challenges and to deliver long-term growth. Now, let me invite David to share his remarks on the first quarter. David Meline : Okay, thanks Bob. The first quarter marked another period of solid performance for the company as we delivered mid-single digit volume growth globally, while we increased investment in the business and delivered year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth in the first quarter. Turning to the financial results on page six of the slide deck, worldwide revenues were 5.6 billion in the first quarter, with worldwide product sales of 5.3 billion, declining 1% year over year as strong unit demand for our newer products was offset by declines in our mature products, including small molecule generic competition against Sensipar. Other revenues at 271 million, increased 60 million driven by royalty income growth. As we continue to make incremental investments to rapidly advance our innovative pipeline and maximize the value of our marketed products, our non-GAAP operating expenses increased 11% year over year. This also contributed to our non-GAAP operating income result at 9% lower than previous year. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased by 2 points to 14.7%, driven by higher manufacturing costs and product mix, partially offset by lower royalty expense. As mentioned last quarter, for the full year, we continue to expect year over year cost of sales expense to be flat to up depending on sales volume. First quarter research and development expenses of 859 million were 16% higher due to increased investments in support of our multiple differentiated early-stage oncology programs. Research and development expense as a percent of product sales was 16.3% for the quarter. For the full year, we currently expect R&D spend on an absolute basis to rise in single-digit percentage terms in 2019. SG&A expenses increased 5% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by support for our newly launched products, including Aimovig, Evenity, and our biosimilar Amgevita and Kanjinti. For the full year, we continued to expect SG&A spend to decline as launch expenses normalize, and we continue with our resource allocation discipline. We remain on track to meet our initial 2019 operating expense guidance of inline versus 2018 on an absolute basis. Our operating expense guidance anticipates several important factors, including one, that we continue to benefit from our productivity program; two, that we make appropriate investments in support of our in line portfolio; three, that we advance our innovative and biosimilar programs; and fourth, that we continue to increase our global presence where we are experiencing rapid volume growth. Other income and expenses were a net 158 million expense in Q1. This is favorable by 24 million on a year over year basis. The non-GAAP tax rate was 14.6% for the quarter, an increase of 0.9 percentage points, primarily due to prior year tax benefit associated with inter-company sales under US corporate tax reform. Non-GAAP net income declined 10% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 3% year over year for the first quarter to $3.56 per share. Turning next to cash flow on the balance sheet on page seven. Free cash flow was 1.7 billion. This was lower than first quarter last year driven by lower net income and an increase in sales deductions paid to customers following higher third and fourth quarter 2018 sales. I note that Q2 will be negatively impacted as we make one-time tax payments of approximately a billion dollars, including our second annual repatriation tax payment. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders, consistent with our commitments, as we deployed 3 billion in Q1 to repurchase 15.9 million shares at an average price of a $191 per share. Given our attractive share price, we plan to repurchase an incremental 1.5 billion to 2 billion of our shares in Q2. Additionally, our first quarter dividend increased to $1.4 per share, an increase of 10% over last year. Cash and investments totaled 26.3 billion, a decrease of approximately 5.9 billion from the first quarter of last year. Our debt balance stands at 33 billion as of March 31, carrying a weighted average interest rate of 4% and an average maturity of 10.8 years. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2019 on page eight, we remain on track with our plans to continue to invest to advance our pipeline, including our early oncology programs, build out our global presence, and drive long-term volume grow. In light of our Q1 performance, we are raising our 2019 guidance. Our revised revenue guidance is 22.0 billion to 22.9 billion versus previous guidance of 21.8 billion to 22.9 billion. This continues to reflect the range of outcomes related to Sensipar generic competition as well as the evolving competitive dynamics associated with the rest of our inline portfolio. With regard to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we're revising the outlook to $13.25 to $14.30 per share versus previous guidance of $13.10 to $14.30 per share. Further, we're maintaining our non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 14% to 15% and we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year. This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Murdo. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, David and good afternoon everyone. You'll find product sales information starting on slides 10 and 11. We're off to a solid start in 2019 with continued volume driven growth across our portfolio of newer products, while we successfully execute lifecycle management strategies in our more mature brands. Moving to first quarter results, let me start with repatha on slide 12. Given the dynamic nature of the PCSK9 class and our confidence in Repatha, I want to provide some detail on its performance and growth prospects. Q1 sales grew by 15% year-over-year, as we hold leading share of the PCSK9 class. Worldwide unit growth was 81% year-over-year with 90% unit growth in the US. The growth is attributable to increasing prescribing depth by cardiologists, increasing prescribing breadth by primary care physicians, and increasing patient fulfillment following the introduction of lower list price Repatha. In Medicare, lower list price Repatha is now available to more than 60% of seniors. The next step is to make the lower list price version available to a majority of Part D patients at a lower fixed copay versus the current co-insurance structure. While this is underway, it's expected to improve early next year as Part D plans update for 2020. Currently, only 6% of Medicare patients are at a low fixed copay level of above $50. For patients covered by commercial insurance, approval rates have improved by 11 points year-over-year, as we continue to secure improved payer utilization management criteria through contracting. We will continue to work with health plans, PBMs and the US administration to get lower list price Repatha to patients more rapidly. And we remain committed to discontinue our original list price Repatha we see sufficient coverage in the market, which could be between now and the beginning of 2020. With regard to pricing, the blended net price for Repatha in the US declined in Q1 due to annual contracts that took effect in January. We're optimistic that we will see a positive impact on volume growth and reported net sales over the longer term. Outside of the US, we continue to work with country authorities to optimize access and are pleased with our first ever launch in China. Overall, our priority remains to help the large underserved population of high risk cardiovascular patients that can benefit from Repatha. Onto Prolia on slide 13. Prolia delivered another strong quarter with sales increasing 20% year-over-year, driven by 17% volume growth. As a reminder, given its six month dosing interval, Prolia exhibits a seasonal sales pattern with Q1 and Q3, representing lower sales than Q2 and Q4. Overall market penetration of the addressable patient population is only in the mid-20% range, indicating significant potential for improved diagnosis and treatment. With his unique profile and through increasing investment, we expect Prolia will remain a very consistent growth driver. I'd like to take the opportunity to comment on our recent approval and launches of EVENITY in the US and Japan in conjunction with our partners, UCB and Astellas. The World Health Organization calls osteoporosis a global epidemic, as there are fewer diagnosed and treated patients in the US than a decade ago. In the US alone, osteoporosis is responsible for 2 million fractures and given the aging population, annual direct costs of osteoporosis are expected to reach $25 billion by the year 2025. EVENITY has convenient once-monthly physician administer dosing for 12 months and strengthens Amgen\u2019s leading position in bone health with two highly innovative molecules that are complementary. We are confident in our ability to continue to penetrate this market. Our US sales force is trained and is already promoting the product. Meanwhile, our launch in Japan through our joint venture with Astellas is off to a strong start. Now on to Aimovig on slide 14. To begin, the unmet need for migraine is substantial. There are approximately 4 million individuals in the US alone who take preventative medications for migraines. However, compliance is low as 75% discontinue therapy after only a year. Approximately 200,000 new patients in the US have now tried Aimovig since it launched less than a year ago, and it remains a significant opportunity for growth as CGRP penetration of the overall market is low. We expect this number to expand considerably given the 26% sequential TRX market growth for CGRP inhibitors in Q1. Prescriber breath is consistently increasing as over 22,000 physicians have now prescribed Aimovig since launch. We\u2019re particularly encouraged the primary care adoption is steadily rising, with nearly 8000 prescribers to date. We also have indicators that our recently launched direct to consumer program is increasing patient awareness for Aimovig. Now, let me take a few minutes to help you understand Aimovig\u2019s performance in Q1. First, Amgen is the market leader with 40% share of new to brand prescriptions, and 60% share of the total prescriptions exiting Q1. Aimovig benefits from strong market access conditions with over 75% approval rates for new patients in both commercial and Medicare Part D plans.  Regarding net selling prices, we experienced a decline, that is the net result of two dynamics. Recall that during the early launch phase of the product, a majority of paid prescriptions were reimbursed at near list price. Currently, the proportion of our business under commercial contract and receiving discounts is near 70%. Meanwhile, the proportion of paid versus free prescriptions increased to 60% at the end of the first quarter. Looking forward, we expect to see strong CGRP market growth, while competing effectively for share. Offsetting this, Aimovig patient persistence will continue to be dynamic, given competing free product offerings in the market. We expect net prices to stabilize in 2019 as a majority of coverage decisions have been made. Additionally, the proportion of free prescriptions should continue to decline over the remainder of 2019. We're confident in the potential for Aimovig to positively impact patient lives and the recent launch of the single 140 milligram auto injector will further enhance the patient experience. Moving to our Hematology and Oncology business, the portfolio of XGEVA, Kyprolis, Nplate, Vectibix, BLINCYTO and IMLYGIC collectively totaled $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 8% year-over-year. Looking at additional details, for some of the larger brands within this portfolio, let's start with XGEVA on slide 16. In Q1, XGEVA grew 6% year-over-year primarily from volume as we gradually see share increasing to just above 60% in the US. We recently received preferred status over zoledronic acid in castration resistance prostate cancer in the recently revised NCCN guidelines, reinforcing XGEVA superiority in this indication. Moving to Kyprolis, which grew 10% year-on-year driven primarily by growth in key markets including the US, which had 12% growth.  Our team continues to emphasize Kyprolis overall survival benefit, and we are pleased to see increased adoption of the once weekly dose approaching close to 20% of share of Kyprolis use in the US. On to Enbrel, sales increased 4% year-over-year, of which 2% was non-recurring, which included a positive 10 point impact from changes in accounting estimates offset partially by 8 points from unfavorable inventory changes. During Q1, rheumatology market growth accelerated by 12% versus the 6% on average over the last eight quarters. Share trends continued and we recognized a limited benefit from net selling price in the quarter, which we expect to persist for the full year. We continue to invest in Enbrel, including the Enbrel mini with Auto touch, a multi-use device, which continues to receive positive feedback from physicians and patients.  Next to our filgrastim brands starting on slide 19. In Q1, Neulasta sales declined 12% year-over-year, which included a $98 million purchase from BARDA. We exited Q1 with approximately 90% share of the long acting segment with Onpro holding share at close to 60% of the segment. Insurance coverage of Neulasta also remains strong in the US with close to 90% of commercial lives and 99% of Medicare lives covered. Currently, we're seeing increased competition in medium sized clinics and small non-340b hospitals and are prepared for additional US entrance in 2019, should they receive approval. Outside of the US, Q1 year-over-year sales declined 12%. We now face three long acting biosimilar competitors in a number of countries in Europe and expect additional entrants during 2019, which will likely accelerate the pace of the client. More broadly, we remain confident that our experienced establish record of quality, dependable supply, and innovative solutions such as Onpro will serve us well as we compete account by account. Turning to slide 20, Neupogen sales were $73 million in Q1 \u201919, sequentially US Q1 results benefited from $7 million of accounting adjustments and Neupogen exited the first quarter with roughly 30% share of the short acting segment. Since the introduction of Neupogen biosimilars in the US, costs to the healthcare system for short acting filgrastim have come down meaningfully. Switching to nephrology starting on slide 21, Q1 Epogen sales declined 10% due to lower net selling price. The first quarter benefited from approximately $20 million of large end customer purchases. Given our contractual pricing commitments with DaVita, net price will continue to decline for Epogen in 2019. Aranesp declined 9% year-over-year in Q1, driven by lower volume due to increased competition. We expect Aranesp sales to continue to decline at a faster rate in 2019 versus 2018 with both long acting and short acting competition in the US. Parsabiv continues to experience solid growth, independent and mid-sized dialysis providers utilize Parsabiv for a majority of their calcium emetic patients, while FMC and DaVita are gradually increasing adoption. Turning to Sensipar, as a result of some at risk small molecule generic launches you can see on slide 24, that our US Q1 sales of $135 million are significantly lower than recent quarters. Given the intrusion of these at risk launches that have now occurred, we expect US sales in Q2 to be lower than Q1. Going forward, performance will be dependent on the outcome of legal proceedings and the rate of consumption of generic inventory across periods. I'd like to close by highlighting the strong performance of our biosimilars where uptake of our European launches for KANJINTI and AMGEVITA is progressing as we anticipated. We're planning for multiple new launches from this portfolio over the next few years and look forward to bringing the value of these assets to patients and the health care system.  In summary, I'm pleased with the solid execution and dedication of our team, as our portfolio evolves in 2019. We're successfully launching new products, driving volume growth and demonstrating the value of our mature brands. We're also now establishing a strong presence in the biosimilars market with customers who appreciate the high quality of Amgen services and product supply. I'm confident that we are prepared to maximize the opportunities to bring Amgen\u2019s products to a greater number of patients. Now, let me turn it over to Dave Reese. David Reese : Thanks, Murdo and good afternoon, everyone. We're off to a rapid and exciting start to 2019 in R&D with progress across our pipeline. I'll begin with our oncology portfolio. We continue to advance our BiTE platform with approximately a dozen molecules now in or close to the clinic. In hematologic malignancies, at ASCO, we will provide an update on the dose escalation trial of our first generation BCMA BiTE molecule, AMG 420. We are now enrolling patients in a dose expansion study. We also expect some of the first clinical data from our new generation BiTE platform by the end of the year with AMG701 and extended half life BCMA BiTE molecule. Our enthusiasm is high for our BCMA BiTE molecules as well as our CD38 bispecific and MCL1 programs as we pursue our commitment to develop therapies that can make a meaningful impact on the treatment of multiple myeloma. Other presentations at ASCO will include the first in human dose escalation study of AMG 212, a BiTE molecule directed against prostate specific membrane antigen, or PSMA, which is highly and specifically expressed in the majority of human prostate tumors. This clinical study was conducted by Bayer through a license they had with Micromet prior to our acquisition. We believe the data from this trial provide proof of concept for the target and bispecific T-cell engager approach in solid tumors, and we have introduced a new half-life extended BiTE molecule, AMG 160, into clinical testing for prostate cancer. AMG 160 is now progressing briskly through dose escalation. As with all of the targets for which we have both first generation and half-life extended BiTE molecules in clinical development, we will preferentially advance the halfway extended molecule if we observe comparable safety and efficacy between the two formats. One final note on our BiTE programs. Recently, we have seen intriguing early clinical evidence of potentially enhanced activity of a BiTE molecule, in this case, BLINCYTO, when given in combination with a PD1 inhibitor. We anticipate sharing a larger data set within a year or so. There's substantial evidence that T-cell activation leads to up regulation of the PD1 access, providing a rationale for this combination.  Based on these biologic and clinical insights, we are incorporating early checkpoint inhibitor combinations into many of our BiTE programs and I'll have more to say on this as studies initiate and we accrue data. I'd like to turn now to a program of great interest, our KRAS G12C program, AMG 510. By way of background, RAS mutations occur in about 25% of all human cancers and the specific KRAS G12C mutation occurs in about 14% of lung adenocarcinomas, the most common form of non-small cell lung cancer. It also occurs in about 4% of colon cancers, a couple of percent of pancreatic tumors and at low frequency and various other cancers. RAS has been a target of active exploration since it was identified as one of the first oncogene, but it remained undruggable due to lack of traditional small molecule binding pockets on the protein. The G12C mutation produces a very shallow group, which allowed us through elegant medicinal chemistry to design an irreversible small molecule inhibitor that locks KRAS into its inactive state. I've spoken in the past on how we are improving productivity and accelerating the timelines of drug development here at Amgen, and AMG 510 is an excellent example. When we knew that we could generate an inhibitor to a key oncogene that had been un-druggable for over 30 years, we accelerated preclinical development and advanced the program from discovery to first in human trials in well under a year. Our presentations at AACR demonstrated that we have a highly specific molecule with good drug like characteristics that can be dosed orally once a day. We also showed in preclinical models that AMG 510 may act synergistically with other agents, a particular interest where the preclinical data AMG inflamed 510 inflamed tumors, in part by up regulating class 1 MHC expression and enhance sensitivity to checkpoint inhibition. We look forward to the opportunity to share the initial data from our first in-human dose escalation study in patients with solid tumors containing KRAS G12C mutations at the upcoming ASCO meeting in Chicago where we will also be hosting an investor event. There have been a lot of questions on the extent of the data that will be available. And what I would say here is that you should expect basic exposure data and the cumulative efficacy and safety data we've got to date. While we have been in the clinic for only about eight months, we've completed dose escalation and are expanding enrollment at the target dose. Moving forward, we will also be exploring AMG 510 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors based on the preclinical work I've described and various targeted therapies. And we are currently moving ahead to include a combination with a PD1 inhibitor in our expansion study. Based on the early clinical data and feedback from our investigators, we're very optimistic on the potential for AMG 510 to address unmet medical need, and look forward to seeing many of you at ASCO. Finally, in oncology, we recently began recruiting patients in a combination study of [indiscernible] plus AMG 176, our intravenous MCL1 inhibitor in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and AML l after seeing strong preclinical evidence of synergy.  We're also rapidly advancing our oral MCL1 inhibitor, AMG 397 through dose escalation in patients with hematologic malignancies. We expect initial clinical data from these programs later this year, along with several other programs. In our accompanying presentation, you can find an overview of our hematology oncology clinical portfolio. Moving to our other therapeutic areas, as a leader in bone health, we are pleased to receive approval of EVENITY as Murdo noted in the US for the treatment of osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture based on disease characteristics or a history of fracture. Postmenopausal osteoporosis, a silent epidemic that affects women in societies around the world, leads to approximately 2 million fragility fractures per year in the United States alone. Despite this, it remains an under diagnosed and undertreated disease with only 20% of these women receiving any type of osteoporosis treatment post fracture. EVENITY is the first and only anabolic therapy with a unique dual effect that both increases bone formation and, to a lesser extent, reduces bone resorption. For patients who need to rapidly increase bone mineral density in 12 months, EVENITY can reduce the risk of a first or subsequent fracture, and in particular, clinical fractures with symptomatic breaks that often lead to disability. In cardiovascular disease, we expect the complete enrollment of our Omecamtiv mecarbil phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study by mid-year and recently passed an interim futility analysis with no recommended changes to the study. AMG 890 or LP(a) siRNA also continues to progress and we anticipate sharing data later this year or early next year. We recently received a pediatric indication for Corlanor for the treatment of stable symptomatic heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy in patients stage six months and older who are in sinus rhythm with an elevated heart rate. And finally, in migraine, as Murdo noted, we received approval for our single 140 milligram Aimovig auto injector, our pre filled syringe in the US. Following inflammation, we began enrolling a phase 2 atopic dermatitis study with Tezepelumab. I'm also pleased to report that our phase 3 study for ABP 959 or biosimilar is enrolling patients. I\u2019ll close by thanking our staff for advancing our exciting pipeline and continuing to deliver for our patients. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay, thank you. Let's open the line up now for questions. And perhaps, I can ask our operator to remind you what the procedures are for submitting your questions. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Dave, I was hoping to ask a two part on KRAS. So I guess the first thing is, it seems like you've progressed through the dose escalation period fairly rapidly. Is that because you hit the MTD faster than you were expecting or are there other factors such as faster enrollment at play? And then how should we view the fact that you're pushing forward here with combinations with PD1? As part of that, the monotherapy efficacy that you've seen is below what you were expecting, or do you think you can drive efficacy substantially higher with those combinations? Thanks. Bob Bradway : Thanks, Matt, for the questions around the KRAS program. Let me take them in order. In terms of the dose escalation, I think we will present the clinical data at ASCO. We had a planned dose escalation in the phase 1 trial, we were able to move through that very quickly based on tolerability. We had quite brisk enrollment based on pre-identification of patients at most of our centers, and we're pleased to have been able to move along in eight months, in a population that is a fraction of lung cancers and other tumors. In terms of the combination, as I've indicated before, I think based on the clinical setting, these molecules may find a home as either monotherapy or in combination. It\u2019s early days, and we're moving quickly to investigate both of these approaches as we move forward and the combinations will be not only with PD-L1 inhibitors based on some of the preclinical data that I described in terms of the KRAS inhibitor, inflaming tumors, and upregulating MHC 1 expression, but also data we've generated on other components of the pathway. So I think all of those will be pieces of what we explore going forward. This program is moving as quickly as almost any I've ever seen here at Amgen. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Maybe Bob would love your perspective just on the proposed Part B demonstration project. In particular, do you anticipate that the IPI proposal could remain here, do you expect there could be any changes? Thanks a lot. Bob Bradway : Well, it's a proposed rule as your question implies, Terence and that enabled quite a bit of commentary and the administration has received something like 4,000 comments from different groups, including quite a wide range of physician groups and patient groups that were concerned about the proposal. It won't surprise you to know that we're concerned about it, and we've expressed that concern as well. We're not interested in seeing patient access to innovative new medicines and physician choice impaired by a potential rule like this. So we and others in the innovative industry have expressed that to the administration.  And I think if you compare the situation in the United States where patients have access to innovative medicines very rapidly, in fact, if you just look at cancer, 95% of the new cancer medicines are available to Medicare patients here in the US, and that compares to about 65% of the same medicines being available in France. And by the way, in France, they're available some 21 months later. So in a cancer patient, that can mean the difference between life and death. So we're not in favor of a rule like this that might have the effect of diminishing access to innovation and impairing investments in innovation over the long term. Having said that, we have been working with the administration around other proposals that we think can help address the concerns of the administration, and we'd like to continue to do that. So we think there are some things that the administration could pursue that would enable the government to get access to the market prices and still enable physicians and patients to use the medicines that they think are appropriate for these diseases. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang : My first question has to do with the Neulasta trend. So year-over-year, sales came down by 12%, units went up by 1%, inventory went down 3, so by my math, the net price is probably coming down by roughly 10%. Can you comment on the pricing trend for the rest of the year for Neulasta? And then can you quickly provide an update on the Enbrel patent ruling against Sandoz. Murdo Gordon : So Ying, I'll take the first one and then I'll ask Bob perhaps to talk about the other question regarding Sandoz and Enbrel. I think overall, we're pleased with how we're performing in the market despite two biosimilar competitors against Neulasta. In particular, we see good durability of our Onpro business, which is holding at around 60% share of the long acting filgrastim franchise. We also continue to compete at an account by account level, and we defend as you point out significant volumes. What will drive further price erosion and potentially share erosion is the number of new competitive entrants, and we're following that very closely going forward. Bob Bradway : On the court case, nothing new to report. As you know, we're waiting for the judge to rule and nothing new to report there. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much. And first question, David, just on the KRAS, could you help us understand how -- in terms of expectations, how treatment response to this particular intervention should compare to other mutations in lung cancer that we're accustomed to seeing? For example, for EGFR, just is it likely to be as canonical if you like as those mutations? And then secondly, Murdo, if you could just give us a little bit more color on Aimovig in particular, it does look as though you've come out of some pressure in terms of share of new prescriptions. Is that a one-time event in the first quarter that we're seeing in the prescription data or has there been a step down because of the contract, and is this the new baseline? Thanks. David Meline : Sure, I'll go ahead and start with the question regarding KRAS biology. I think, there's probably no specific answer for that, Jeff. In some tumors, this mutation will be a trunk mutation, a driver mutation, and we may well expect monotherapy activity in other tumors based on the other suite of molecular alterations that are present, you may need combinations or another approach. I think these are all things we will sort out where we'll be doing extensive molecular profiling on the tumors as we move forward to try to sort out the best predictors of response and resistance. Murdo Gordon : Yeah, and Jeff, considering the huge unmet need in migraine, we continue to feel good about the opportunity to grow new prescription base and to continue to compete effectively for share. As you know, we're still the market leader with 60% TRx share, around a 40% NBRx share. We have nice coverage across commercial and Medicare Part D payers. And we continue to drive good increases in the percent of patients that are paying for their Aimovig through commercial insurance benefits. So what we are seeing in our trends, in our total prescriptions is some effect of the bolus of patients that we secured when we first launched into the market and working then through the free drug to paid transition. We're also trying to understand what the persistence is in the CGRP category. We saw that it was between 20% and 30% in clinical trials, we'll be looking to see how that shapes up in the real world as we move forward. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Kennen Mackay from RBC Capital Markets. Kennen Mackay : Quick R&D question, you'd mentioned tezepelumab phase 2 moving forward in atopic derm, hadn't Tezepelumab missed a primary important in the prior phase 2a and AD and what sort of the difference in how you're thinking about this, how high has this evolved? Murdo Gordon : Yeah. I think we've gained a greater understanding of the approach to the disease, the variants and background medications. This is the disease that also has a waxing and waning on natural history. And so, we have, with our partners, have designed a subsequent phase 2 study that we think will rigorously evaluate the utility of Tezepelumab in AD. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Carter Gould from UBS Equities. Carter Gould : I want to change the pace for a second, ask one on the Omecamtiv progress you've been making, specifically, if there are any additional planned interim analyses either for futility or stopping really for efficacy. And then just maybe your initial thoughts on how this, you think this may be positioned in HF, maybe alongside [indiscernible]? David Meline : Sure. This is Dave. I'll take that question. So, typically in these trials, there are interim analyses for efficacy. They are event driven, and we will communicate at the appropriate time as we might expect those data. I think one of the things that excites us about Omecamtiv is that its mechanism of action is novel, we think it's orthogonal to many of the existing therapies and should be able to be added to existing background therapies. To me, that's one of the potential great attractions of the drug for advanced heart failure. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Yaron Werber from Cowen and Company. Yaron Werber : Great. Thank you. So David, I've also a follow up on KRAS, can you give us a little bit of a sense, was this a typical three by three dose escalation? Or are you doing into patient escalation? And would you break out the results by tumor type as well? And then I have a quick question on Sensipar. David Reese : Yeah, what I'll say is all those questions will be answered at ASCO. And, I don't want to get out in front of our investigators and steal their thunder, but will provide great detail in the phase 1 presentation. What was your second question? Wanted to ask a second question about Sensipar? Yaron Werber : Can you give us a sense? Are the launchers for Sensipar, are they [indiscernible] and are they still subject to the litigation coming up in in June? David Meline : Yeah, so what I'd say, this is Meline. So first point is, if you look at the guidance that we offered this afternoon, what we've given you is, while it's a bit narrower, it's still quite broad. And the reason for that is the uncertainty around, will we have additional launches this year or not. And of course, that is driven by the fact that we do have litigation that's still going on and we expect that to conclude here sometime in the coming months. So, hence the breath of the guidance. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Do Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Do Kim : I wanted to ask about the Humira biosimilar market in Europe. We know that biosimilars in the European landscape is fairly mature. But with so many competitors out there, how are you seeing how the market for Humira will shape out and how do you position your biosimilar with so many competitors? Murdo Gordon : Yeah. Thank you, Do for the question. This is Murdo. What we're seeing in Europe in general in the biosimilars market is more rapid penetration of the biosimilars of the innovator compound, so higher biosimilar penetration in general across a number of different categories. Our shares are more or less in line with what we had anticipated and price is a little lower. So we're seeing higher volume due to that penetration, offsetting somewhat lower prices and the prices you have to be a little bit careful. Most of the interest and news that we read about on pricing, particularly in the case of the Humira biosimilar were related to tender prices in some smaller European markets. And those were pretty significant winner takes all price reductions. What you're seeing in the broader marketplace at the national formulary level and at regional formularies are better prices holding up quite well and we foresee the biosimilar business to be a significant revenue driver for some time to come. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : I'm curious about the VESALIUS-CV outcomes trial for Repatha. Can you comment on the key differences between this outcomes trial and the Fourier trial and how that study may impact on long term commercial potential for Repatha? And then separately, anything we should be looking out for at AAN next week in terms of data for Aimovig. Thank you. David Reese : Well, I'll get half of the Repatha question and then Murdo will take the other one and I can address that Aimovig at AAN. So in terms of VESALIUS, these are patients with known, essentially known coronary artery disease, but who have not had an event, so they are very high risk. It's a population that, numbers in the millions beyond what we were the target population studied in the Fourier trial. We think it should add to the substantial body of evidence that we have with Repatha in another high risk population. Murdo, you may want to comment on the commercial component. Murdo Gordon : Yeah, we\u2019re continuing to work hard to penetrate that high risk cardiovascular patient population and compete in that category. We are seeing the data are more similar than different to what we've already had in the public domain. And we're really pleased with the 80%, 81% volume evolution and we continue to believe that more and more physicians are understanding the value of treating these higher risk cardiovascular patients. David Reese : And then in terms of Aimovig data at the American Academy of Neurology meeting, which is starting in four or five days, we do have what I think are some very interesting data, long term safety and efficacy data in both chronic and episodic migraine. The abstracts for those who are interested are up now. In chronic migraine, for example, we were able to show that roughly two-thirds of patients were able to convert to episodic migraine, meaning fewer than 15 migraine days per month. And on average, depending on the population and the dose, the number of migraine headache days per month was reduced by 8 to 12 days per month. That's a very substantial clinical impact for these patients, as you can imagine. So those data are coming out within the next week or so. Bob Bradway : Those data also support the launch of the new single 140 milligram dose. So they give in that patients who got to that higher dose tends to do even better on conversion. David Reese : Right. And there are, in those patients, complete responders, which is remarkable in this disease. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael Yee : Hey, thanks for the question. Good afternoon. I guess I wanted to ask a question related to two ongoing litigation issues, somewhat with the same company. One is, if for some reason the IP does not go in your favor for some reason on Enbrel, what are the implications? And what are the scenarios that we should know or for shareholders to know? And then maybe you can just comment on the separate litigation related to Aimovig, the thing that was a bit surprising to people. So maybe just comment on what the implications are there. Thanks so much. Bob Bradway : Yeah, sure, Mike. I can understand that. On the first one, we feel pretty strongly about the IP case that was presented. And so obviously, if judgment were to go against us, we would immediately appeal. But on the Aimovig partnership, look, the first thing to underscore is that the teams in the field are committed to doing what's right for patients here and it's unfortunate that we have a dispute with our partner about this matter. But that's why we had dispute resolution options specified in a contract like this. So we feel that our partner is enabling a competitor product. And so we want to pursue that matter in courts, and that's where we are. But as I said, that will probably play out over a period of time. And in the meanwhile, both teams are committed to continuing to pursue this therapy for those patients who benefit from it. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Alethia Young : I just wanted to talk a little bit about the biosimilars because I know you've had put out kind of a longer term guidance around the 3 billion number, but I just wanted now that we have some biosimilars in the market, how you guys are thinking about the prospects, do you think it\u2019s a more attractive business, less attractive about the same, just want you to kind of frame some of the puts and takes that we can think about potential longer term value of that business? Bob Bradway : Obviously, it's still very early days in the US based on our European experience and what we continue to believe the market outlook is, in the US, wouldn't change the long range comments we've made. Historically, I think that they still hold up. And we continue to pursue a number of really interesting and solid molecules and we continue to prepare for launches in the US in the not too distant future. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan. Cory Kasimov : I wanted to ask on Aimovig and wondered if you could provide some color on this constipation issue that some docs and your competitors talk about with the drug. I guess I'm wondering how frequently this leads to discontinuations and what you might be doing to alleviate this, assuming it is even in fact an issue. Murdo Gordon : Yeah, thanks for the question. We do hear about this issue. And obviously we're always making sure that we provide necessary patient support and physician support around the safety net part of our product. But we also think on this one, there's quite a large amount of rhetoric that's been created around this issue, given how the product performed in clinical trials, the stated incidence of constipation, our label, and it'll even be reported in the long term follow up data at AAN. And so I think it's been well characterized in good, well designed and continuous clinical trials.  We're also pleased that many physicians, particularly the prescribers in the large scale headache centers, are telling us that it's a relatively low incidence, and that they have very little trouble having patients started on Aimovig and persisting. I think, some of the other things we're seeing in persistence and I mentioned it in response to an earlier questioner just, given that we were the entire market for many months without competition, we are seeing some persistence effects in our continuing patient population that are different than what you might have concluded from looking at the clinical trials.  And that's a function of both people who are moving from one free trial offer to another. And it's a function of people who are perhaps not pursuing commercial insurance. And obviously, there's a small component of that that is switching away to other agents. So there's still an evolving understanding of how persistent patients are to your question on discontinuation of Aimovig and it will take many months to understand that you need at least a 12 month look back period. That puts us in the 18 to 24 month timeframe before we'll be able to actually ascertain durability. David Reese : And Cory from a clinical perspective, I would reiterate what Murdo said, what we hear from physicians experts is that they see it at a low incidence? It's clinically quite manageable. They don't really view it as any sort of barrier at all. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Meacham from Barclays. Geoffrey Meacham : Just had a pipeline question for Dave. Broadly on the earlier pipeline, you're still in dose escalation for BCMA, for PSMA, for KRAS, et cetera. But presumably you\u2019ve had some evidence of efficacy and I know it's data dependent, but is there a path to moving rapidly into pivotal studies, even if it's the registration phase 2, I just wasn't sure if this was even an option or there had been discussions with regulators on this. Thanks. Murdo Gordon : Yeah, of course, that'll vary program by program. But what I would say in general is that our goal in these programs will be to move as quickly as we can through dose escalation and then move into expansion and potentially pivotal phases of the program. I think given the target diseases and the potential regulatory paths, that's a realistic expectation. And that's how we've planned many of the clinical development programs. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : I wanted to go back to KRAS again for a quick second and basically ask, based on everything you saw in the preclinical data, would you have expected to hit MTD by this third or fourth dose? And also you mentioned seeing cumulative efficacy at ASCO is what do you intend to show? Should we be expecting a dose response? And then separately on Enbrel, was curious what the net price trend was in the first quarter year-over-year adjusting for the accounting treatment? Thank you. David Meline : Okay. I think there were several questions, Umer. David Reese : In relation to KRAS, again the clinical data will present, so I won't comment on the specifics of dose response. I will say that, this is an irreversible inhibitor. And our anticipation is that achieving adequate exposure for a period of time, probably a few hours over the course of a dosing interval a day is adequate to poison the target and inhibit signaling and so our dose escalation was planned with that goal in mind and will present complete details in about a month at ASCO. Murdo Gordon : And Umer, on your question regarding Enbrel, we did have a strong quarter on Enbrel. It was primarily driven by a strong market across rheumatology, and we did see some net price benefit based on that price increase as well as improved contracts in the New Year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Ronny Gal : Two if I may. First, if you can break for us the relative sales of Kanjinti and Amgevita, just trying to keep track on those molecules individually. And secondly, Aimovig, Murdo, you mentioned that you\u2019re expecting the net price stabilization of this molecule and I was kind of wondering about this comment. It seems like the payers have not really selected their preferred agency out there, even as I just added, so I was wondering if there wouldn't be another step down in pricing expected when they choose to prefer agents and then with orals coming about a year out, wouldn\u2019t that cause another step down at pricing at that point, so I'm just -- can you put this comment in context? Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Ronny. We're not breaking the biosimilar sales by brand yet. Still a volatile market, but we are happy with both trends on both products going forward. We're also, as you look at Aimovig, my comment, if you recall, has two components to it. One is the net price reduction based on additional contracts that could occur throughout the course of the year, plus a rising percentage of prescriptions that are paid and the two offsetting one another, leading to a stable price, at least for this year. And I think that that would be my clarification to your question. Arvind Sood : Let\u2019s take one last question and afterwards Bob will make some closing comments. Operator : And our last question is from the line of Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities. Salim Syed : I guess one for me, a multipart one on Repatha, on the new CVOT trial. I guess maybe if you could just give us some color on what the genesis of the designer of that trial was, given it seems to mimic medicines companies almost like line for line. And should we be thinking of that as a validation of value proposition in the marketplace as we think about long term Repatha sales? David Meline : I'll be happy to address that question. Yeah. I mean, that's, we design that study, from a technical perspective, just the way we design any study, based on expected magnitude of effect, target population, all of the typical statistical calculations that go in clinical perspectives that go into study design, we weren't using anyone else\u2019s trials, a template for that study, and I wouldn't call it validation of anything but the internally consistent results from that trial alone. Arvind Sood : Bob, would you like to make some closing comments? Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you. Well, in closing, we're off to a good start in 2019. And I hope you share our team's enthusiasm for our long term prospects. We have a number of medicines that are in line portfolio that can and we expect will benefit significantly more patients as we grow longer term. We have an emerging portfolio of branded biosimilars, which we talked about, and we think will be a new source of growth for us. We're advancing a record number of potential new medicines in our pipeline targeted at some of the most prevalent costly and serious diseases facing society today. Our financial strength I think, is evident again, this quarter and our durable cash flows will allow us to continue to invest in the business, but also provide meaningful returns for our shareholders and deliver transformational innovation for patients. Most importantly, I want to just end by thanking our staff who are fully engaged and behind our mission and thank them for the work they did to get us off to a solid start in 2019. We look forward to talking to all of you at the ASCO investor meeting and then at the second quarter call in July. Thank you. Arvind Sood : Right. Thanks, everybody. If you have any follow-on questions, if we didn't get to your question or if you have comments you would like to discuss, feel free to reach out to me or other members of my team. Thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Amgen\u2019s first quarter 2019 financial results conference call. We thank you greatly for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker\u2019s prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Okay. Thanks, Ian. Good afternoon everybody, and thanks for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. As I've done in the past, I would like to extend a special welcome to those who are new in their coverage of our company. And this quarter, it's Mohit Bansal of Citi. Welcome Mohit. I think our performance in the second quarter can be best characterized as continued execution while staying focused on sustained long-term growth. Leading the discussion today will be our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, who will provide a strategic perspective on our business particularly within the backdrop of a fast-changing business environment. Our CFO, David Meline will then review our financial results for the second quarter and provide updated guidance. Our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Murdo Gordon will review our product performance; followed by our Head of R&D, Dave Reese, who will provide a pipeline update. As we have done in the past, we will use slides to guide our discussion today and you should have received a link separately. Just a reminder that we'll use non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Arvind and thank all of you for joining us. Halfway through the year we're making clear progress in delivering on our strategy for long-term growth and at the core of this strategy of course are innovative first-in-class medicines addressing serious diseases globally. While our strategy embraces medicines like BLINCYTO, which is our bispecific T-cell engager for example with its large effect size in a specialty market, our strategy also explicitly addresses diseases where the unmet need is measured in many millions of patients. Over time, we think this balance is going to be essential and expect that increasing global price pressures will highlight the importance of products that can deliver sustained growth through volume gains rather than annual price increases. Prolia is a great example of this. Now more than 10 years after launch it once again posted double-digit volume growth this quarter and its long-term prospects remain bright as there are still millions of women at high risk of fracture, who are not yet on a preventative therapy like Prolia. The recent launch of EVENITY will enable us to extend our industry leadership in bone health, and bring more options to positions seeking to address the global epidemic of osteoporosis. More generally, Prolia points the way for other products in our portfolio like Repatha, Aimovig and potentially tezepelumab. Let me touch briefly on Repatha. I think all of us know that cardiovascular disease is a leading health problem globally. The numbers are so large that some seem to have been numbed or lulled into a sense of complacency about them, but that's changing partly because after decades of decreasing morbidity and mortality, the trends have worsened and the death rate from heart attack and stroke is now actually increasing in the U.S. and internationally. We know one of the reasons for this is that LDL levels are too high in too many people. We believe Repatha offers a solution to that problem for many people. And given demographics, health systems cannot continue to ignore the meaningful uptick in cardiovascular events and deaths. It will only get worse without more widespread use of innovative medicines that address atherosclerotic disease. We see increasing recognition of this here and abroad, and of course we're seeking to do our part including taking actions as we did last year in a competitive context to lower the out-of-pocket costs for patients to use this therapy. We will continue to advocate for high-risk patients and those who recognize the urgency of getting in front of the growing problem of heart disease in our society. With Aimovig, our first-in-class CGRP medicine we're transforming the treatment of migraine. Like Prolia and Repatha, it addresses a chronic debilitating disease afflicting millions of people worldwide. We recently presented important new data at the American Headache Society meeting demonstrating that Aimovig's efficacy improves over time. We expect this medicine to be of increasing importance to migraine sufferers and a key growth driver for years to come. Turning to our growing hematology and oncology products, we posted 10% growth for KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Nplate Vectibix, IMLYGIC and BLINCYTO which together are annualizing at more than $5 billion revenues. We see more growth ahead from these medicines. Our confidence in BLINCYTO was bolstered by the compelling five-year survival data we reported in MRD-positive ALL patients. Based on this and other data emerging from our BiTE platform our confidence in that therapy is high. The demand for innovative medicines is growing rapidly outside the U.S. and the larger European markets. Looking at demographic trends, we expect this to continue for some time. That's why we've made international expansion an important part of our strategy. We're beginning to see measurable returns from our efforts. Internationally our volumes were up 18% in the second quarter. And if you look at markets where we were historically absent like Japan and China, you can also see the benefits of our strategy coming to light. Japan was the first country to approve EVENITY globally and was our first market launch. We're very pleased with the uptake there. Similarly, BLINCYTO is performing well in Japan. And overall, we're encouraged by the performance of our Amgen-Astellas biopharma partnership. China, though it is still early days for Amgen, represents another attractive long-term growth opportunity for us and we're encouraged by the progress in advancing our medicines for that market with the early launches of Repatha and XGEVA. At Amgen, whenever we talk about delivering in the long-term, we're always clear that you only get to deliver in the long-term, if you succeed in the short and medium-term. Our results in Q2 show that we're doing that. With pressure following patent expirations across a number of our products, we maintained strong operating margins, attractive returns on our capital and ongoing steady return of cash to our shareholders in dividends and buybacks. And our stewardship of the business is also reflected in our competitive market share performance across our mature and recently launched portfolio of products. We'll be staying closely focused on execution and productivity, as we seek to invest in the long-term opportunities that will enable us to reestablish our long-term track record and growth. Our long-term opportunities include many novel first-in-class therapies across all phases of our pipeline. One of these of course is AMG 510 our KRAS G12C inhibitor, which has generated significant interest and continues to move very rapidly through the clinic. We anticipate many important data readouts across the portfolio over the next 12 months as we advance therapies against cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and other inflammatory disorders. Additionally, I'd like to note in Q2 we bolstered our industry-leading human genetics capability with our collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare and we added a new important research platform through our acquisition of Nuevolution. Dave Reese will share more information about our pipeline as well as these collaborations when he talks about research and development in a moment. Now let me share a couple of thoughts with you on the drug pricing debate here in the United States noting first that the environment remains fluid. The administration and Congress as you know are considering various proposals, but it's too early to speculate on whether there will be any changes and if there are any what the impact of them might be given that the process is still playing out. I know the Senate Finance Committee bill in particular has attracted attention and is an important example of this focus, but many provisions in the bill remain controversial and will likely be modified before advancing. Amgen's particularly focused on ensuring that patients benefit more directly from any savings that are generated by legislation that's advancing and we think that in general more can be done to help patients who bear in present anyway a disproportionate share of drug costs through out-of-pocket expenses. And we'll continue to engage in a thoughtful dialogue with the administration and Congress on drug pricing issues and we're committed to find ways to drive change that still promotes innovation and respects our market-based initiatives that will help address financial and societal burden of some of the world's most serious diseases. One solution to alleviate some of the financial and societal burden is through the introduction of biosimilars. Last year, we launched our first biosimilars in Europe, KANJINTI, our biosimilar to Herceptin, and AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to Humira. A couple of weeks ago we launched KANJINTI and MVASI, our biosimilar to Avastin in the U.S. We believe biosimilars will play an increasingly important role in helping to address issues of access and affordability in the U.S. and around the world, and we're excited to be a leader in this emerging space. I'll end by highlighting that we continue to generate strong cash flow, continue to invest in R&D aggressively and to prudently return excess capital to shareholders. We're in a strong position to grow our business organically and externally, but we'll remain disciplined in business development opportunities. As I stated earlier, Amgen is executing well and we remain excited about our long-term outlook. I'll turn the call over now to David Meline, who will review our financial performance. David? David Meline : Okay. Thanks Bob. Overall, we are pleased with our strong performance in the second quarter, as investments in support of our newer products delivered volume-driven growth and year-over-year EPS growth in the second quarter. Turning to the financial results on page 6 of the slide deck. Worldwide revenues at $5.9 billion in the second quarter declined 3% year-over-year. Worldwide product sales at $5.6 billion in the second quarter declined 2% year-over-year, as growth for our newer products was slightly outpaced by declines in our mature brands impacted by increasing competition due to patent expirations. Other revenues at $297 million declined $83 million year-over-year, due to a prior year milestone payment. We continue to expect full year other revenues of about $1.1 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $3 billion and declined 5% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 53% for the second quarter. As in prior years, our operating margin is expected to be lower in the second half of the year, driven by the timing of expenses. Consistent with our plans, second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 1% year-over-year as we continued to make incremental investments to drive growth and maximize shareholder value while benefiting from our permanent productivity capability. As communicated earlier this year, we continue to expect full year 2019 operating expense on an absolute basis to be flat versus 2018. On a non-GAAP basis cost of sales as a percent of product sales was relatively flat year-over-year at 13.2%. We anticipate 2019 full year cost of sales on an absolute basis to be flat to slightly up depending on volume and continuing to reflect our industry leading performance. Second quarter research and development expenses of $906 million were 7% higher year-over-year due to increased investments in support of our early and late-stage oncology programs. Research and development expense, as a percent of product sales, was 16.3%. For the full year we continue to expect R&D spend trajectory on an absolute basis to increase in single-digit percentage terms as our pipeline advances. SG&A expenses decreased 6% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by reduced discretionary general and administrative expenses and cost management discipline. We expect that for the full year SG&A expense on an absolute basis will decline year-over-year. Other income and expenses were a net $114 million expense in Q2. This is favorable by $71 million on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by prior year investment portfolio liquidation losses as well as continued good performance for our Amgen ventures portfolio. The non-GAAP tax rate was 15.3% for the quarter, a 1.1 point increase versus the second quarter of 2018, primarily due to a prior year tax benefit associated with inter-company sales under U.S. corporate tax reform. Non-GAAP net income decreased 4% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 4% year-over-year for the second quarter to $3.97 per share. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 7. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2019 was $1.3 billion. This was lower than second quarter last year as this year's result was negatively impacted by an advanced tax deposit payment. Consistent with our principles, we continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders. In Q2, we deployed $2.3 billion to repurchase 13.1 million shares at an average price of $180 per shares. We plan to repurchase an incremental 1 billion to 2 billion of our shares in Q3. Additionally, our second quarter dividend increased to $1.45 per share, an increase of 10% over last year. Cash and investments totaled $21.8 billion, a decrease of approximately $7.6 billion from the second quarter of last year, primarily due to share repurchases and debt repayments. Our debt balance stands at $30.6 billion as of June 30, a reduction of approximately $3.9 billion from a year ago as we continue to pay down our debt as it matures. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2019 on page 8. We remain on track with our plans to continue to advance our pipeline, including our oncology programs, build out our global presence and drive long-term volume growth while delivering solid business performance. Today, we are revising our 2019 guidance, which reflects our solid Q2 performance and the outlook for the second half of the year. Our revised revenue guidance is $22.4 billion to $22.9 billion versus previous guidance of $22.0 billion to $22.9 billion. This continues to reflect the range of evolving competitive dynamics associated with Neulasta and other legacy products. With regard to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we are revising the outlook to $13.75 to $14.30 a share versus previous guidance of $13.25 to $14.30. Further, we are maintaining our non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 14% to 15%. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year. This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Murdo. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. You'll find product sales information starting on Slide 10. In the second quarter of 2019, we continued to grow volumes across our newer portfolio, while competing effectively with our more mature brands. Moving to second quarter results, let me start with Repatha on Slide 12. Q2 sales grew by 3% year-over-year as we continue to hold leading share of the PCSK9 class in this competitive market. Worldwide unit growth was 59% year-over-year with 66% unit growth in the United States. In the first half of the year, over 50,000 new patients were prescribed Repatha in the U.S. which was close to a 55% increase versus the same period last year. The PCSK9 class has shown steady quarter-over-quarter growth which we expect to continue throughout the second half of 2019 as we continue to make it our priority to improve access and affordability for patients. For Medicare patients, our 60% list price reduction materially improves affordability and key to that patient affordability is access to Repatha at a low fixed co-pay tier. And while the lower list price version is now available to approximately 70% of seniors, we continue to be disappointed that payers have restricted low fixed co-pay coverage to 7% of Medicare patients. So, as we go through the bidding cycle for 2020, we're very focused on improving this number. Further on the commercial access front, we've recently obtained coverage at ESI which will help to expand access to close to 22 million patients. Recently a study published in circulation demonstrated that high-risk individuals had a 16% increased risk of a cardiovascular event during the 11.5-month study period when their PCSK9 treatment was rejected by their insurance plan. The findings reinforce the need for continued engagement from all stakeholders from health care professionals to payers to plans and to government agencies to improve access and patient affordability so that patients who need Repatha can get Repatha. With regard to pricing, the blended net price for Repatha in the U.S. declined in Q2 2019 versus the previous year due to contracts that took effect last July and the introduction of the lower list price SKU last October. Sequentially, net selling price was roughly flat. We're committed to driving adoption of the lower list price SKU and our current plan is to discontinue the original list price SKU in the beginning of 2020. With these actions and our efforts to open up access for Medicare patients at a low fixed co-pay, we expect that we will see a positive impact on volume and reported net sales growth over the long-term. Next on to Prolia on Slide 13. Prolia continued its strong performance with sales increasing 14% year-over-year, driven by 15% volume growth. Given the seasonality, quarters two and four delivered higher sales versus quarters one and three. We continued to increase our investments in Prolia to drive penetration in this undertreated population and have seen double-digit year-over-year new patient growth in the U.S. Along with EVENITY, our innovative bone-building therapy, we're focused on addressing this global epidemic and increasing diagnosis and treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis patients. EVENITY has convenient once-monthly physician-administered dosing for 12 months and strengthens Amgen's leading position in bone health. Through our joint venture with Astellas, we launched in Japan and in March sold $25 million in Q2. The U.S. launch in partnership with UCB commenced in April and early feedback has been positive. Now on to Aimovig on Slide 15. Versus Q1 sales increased 41%. We hold the leading share of the CGRP market and continue to see improvement in our conversion of free-to-paid patients exiting Q2 at 74% paid. That increase in the percentage of paid volume was a significant driver of quarter-over-quarter sales growth. Penetration in the overall market is currently low considering 4 million migraine patients in the U.S. are eligible for CGRP treatment. However, we remain optimistic as 7,000 patients a week start a CGRP therapy and to-date, 225,000 patients have been prescribed Aimovig with 1 million prescriptions filled. Additionally the number of prescribers is consistently increasing as 27,000 physicians have now prescribed Aimovig since launch with close to 10,000 primary care prescribers among them. We expect net price to remain relatively stable going forward as most patients have converted from free-to-paid and an increasing percentage of patients are covered under discounted contracts versus paying full list price. We launched a single convenient monthly Aimovig a 140-milligram autoinjector replacing the two by 70-milligram presentation. Coupled with a further expansion into retail we believe there's a small one-time increase in the amount of product in the channel in the quarter to prepare for this demand. We're confident that Aimovig will continue to grow and contribute to the strength of Amgen's innovative portfolio. Moving to our hematology and oncology business the portfolio of XGEVA, Kyprolis, Nplate, Vectibix, BLINCYTO, and IMLYGIC collectively totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter growing 10% year-over-year. For more detail on the larger brands, let's start with XGEVA on slide 17. In Q2, XGEVA grew 10% year-over-year, primarily from volume. In the U.S. share is approximately 60%. And we're seeing rapid growth in multiple myeloma patients, while also growing the number of treated solid tumor patients. Kyprolis grew 2%, year-on-year driven primarily by 13% volume growth in the U.S. Recall, that in the second quarter of last year, our international business recognized $27 million in clinical trial purchases. And when normalizing for clinical trial purchases across periods, the underlying worldwide business grew 8%. Moving to Enbrel, sales increased 5%, year-over-year driven primarily by net selling price benefits. Overall, we expect volume trends to continue. And anticipate a slight benefit from net selling price on a full year basis. Next to Neulasta on slide 20, overall, the competitive dynamic is playing out as we expected on a global basis. In Q2, Neulasta sales declined 25% year-over-year, with a 24% decline in the U.S. Exit share of Neulasta in the U.S. was just under 80% in the long-acting segment with absolute units of Onpro, stable on a quarter-over-quarter basis, as many providers and their patients continued to appreciate the benefits of Onpro. This performance reflects the confidence that our customers have, in the reliability and quality of our supply. The decline in U.S. Neulasta units continues to come primarily from our prefilled syringe, reflecting a competitive biosimilar market. Regarding our international business, Neulasta declined 31%, due to increasing competition. Switching to nephrology starting on slide 21, Q2 Epogen sales declined 11% due to lower net selling price. This quarter also benefited from approximately $15 million of large one-time, end-customer purchases. And $13 million in favorable changes to accounting estimates. Given our contractual pricing commitments with DaVita, net price will continue to decline for EPOGEN in 2019. Aranesp declined 8% year-over-year in Q2, driven by lower volume due to increased competition. We expect Aranesp sales to continue to decline at a faster rate in 2019 versus 2018, with both long-acting and short-acting competition in the U.S. Parsabiv continues to experience solid growth, more than doubling sales on a year-over-year basis. Independent and midsize dialysis providers utilize Parsabiv for a majority of their calcium emetic patients, while FMC and DaVita are increasing their adoption. Turning to Sensipar, as a result of some at-risk small-molecule generic launches you can see on slide 24, that Q2 sales declined by approximately $300 million year-over-year. We believe that inventory of generic Sensipar remains in the market. Given ongoing legal proceedings, there remains uncertainty about the magnitude of future U.S. Sensipar sales. I'd like to highlight the strong performance of our biosimilar products. Our launches of Kanjinti, our biosimilar to Herceptin, and Amgevita our biosimilar to Humira outside the U.S. are progressing in line with our expectations, annualizing at greater than $300 million. We also recently launched our first-ever biosimilars in the U.S. with Kanjinti and Mvasi our biosimilar to Avastin. We are encouraged that our experience in the dynamics of both innovator and biosimilar molecules and our expertise in world-class biologic manufacturing will benefit us greatly in shaping and advancing this important market for patients and payers. In summary, I'm pleased to see, that our careful planning for the evolution of our product portfolio is progressing nicely. I continue to believe we are well positioned to deliver volume growth in the future, as we launch and grow new products, deliver value with biosimilar products and defend our mature brands. We're prepared for the challenges that face us. And continue to drive toward providing patients with high-quality, innovative and biosimilar products in markets across the globe. Now let me turn it over to Dave Reese. David Reese : Thanks, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been a year since I assumed leadership of the R&D organization. And I wanted to take a moment to reflect on our progress. Two of the core challenges facing any R&D group, are improving success rates and decreasing the drug development cycle time. To address these challenges, we've created a research organization that has tightly integrated triple-threat capabilities, namely, one, human genetics as a foundation, two core strength in biology, and 3 world-class molecular engineering. We have made tangible progress on all fronts. And I would like to highlight some recent announcements that build on this. The acquisition of deCODE Genetics, gave us the industry-leading human genetics platform. And we have expanded that capability. Today there are about 1.6 million participants in the deCODE database. Last month, we announced the collaboration with Intermountain Health, a leading integrated delivery network here in the U.S. which will increase our sample size by up to 0.5 million, over the next five years. This unique collaboration will give participants access to important genetic information as appropriate, allow the leaders of Intermountain to use genetics to improve population health. And enhance our target discovery and development efforts. The platform we have put in place will solidify our lead in the use of human genetics for years to come. Another investment in our innovation engine was the acquisition of Nuevolution now completed. We'd like to welcome our new colleagues in Copenhagen and look forward to integrating their world-class expertise in DNA-encoded library and other technologies into our research platform. These technologies enhance our small molecule capabilities and our ability to engineer molecules that induce targeted protein degradation, on which we will place a major emphasis going forward. Turning to our therapeutic areas. In cardiovascular disease, we have completed enrollment in our Omecamtiv mecarbil Phase 3 outcome study. At over 8,000 patients, GALACTIC-HF is one of the largest heart failure clinical studies ever conducted and speaks to the emphasis we have placed on building a clinical trials platform that can deliver rapid and efficient study execution. This is an event-driven study and we will provide updates on expected timing as events accumulate. With AMG 890 our LP(a) small interfering RNA program, we are now enrolling patients with known elevated LP(a) based on the data on the healthy human volunteers and anticipate launching the next phase of development in the first half of next year. In inflammation, enrollment in our tezepelumab Phase 3 asthma study continues on schedule with data expected next year. We are also advancing AMG 570, a bispecific antibody peptide conjugate that targets ICOS ligand and BAFF into Phase 2 for the treatment of systematic lupus erythematosus. I will have more to say on AMG 570 as the program progresses. In our migraine portfolio, we recently presented additional long-term Aimovig data at the American Academy of Neurology and American Headache Society meetings that demonstrate sustained reductions in monthly migraine days. Aimovig is the only CGRP inhibitor with four-year clinical data in migraine with 77% of Aimovig patients achieving at least a 50% response more than half achieving at least a 75% response and one-third achieving a 100% response in monthly migraine day reduction. No new safety signals were detected over the extended treatment period. In bone health, EVENITY is now approved in Japan and the U.S. as Murdo discussed and we also recently received approval in other countries including Canada, Australia and South Korea. We were disappointed by the negative opinion for EVENITY in Europe by the CHMP. UCB has submitted a written notice to the European Medicines Agency requesting reexamination of the CHMP opinion and we will support UCB in this endeavor. We strongly believe that EVENITY is an important treatment option in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis who are at high risk of fracture. Turning to oncology. I'll begin with AMG 510, our KRAS G12C inhibitor. After nearly four decades of research in the pursuit of a KRAS inhibitor, the response from the medical community to our first-in-human data at ASCO was simply overwhelming. We reported a 50% response rate in non-small cell lung cancer and very encouraging stable disease data in colorectal cancer with a tolerable adverse event profile. Today I am pleased to report that we now have formal tumor responses in colorectal and appendiceal cancer patients and the program is moving forward rapidly. We have completed enrollment in our monotherapy expansion cohort and are also now enrolling non-small cell lung cancer patients in the PD-1 combination arm. We will also begin enrollment of lung cancer patients in the coming days in the potential registration enabling Phase 2 monotherapy portion of the program and we'll provide an update of our progress in lung cancer at the 2019 World Conference on Lung Cancer in early September. I would highlight that we are coming up on just one year since initially entering the clinic in August of 2018. We remain extraordinarily enthusiastic about the promise of AMG 510 and continue to aggressively prosecute the development program. Turning to our BiTE platform. We presented the first solid tumor data from a BiTE molecule at ASCO with AMG 212, our prostate-specific membrane antigen BiTE molecule for castrate resistant prostate cancer. The initial data were very encouraging and we are currently in dose escalation with an extended half life BiTE molecule AMG 160. At ASCO we also provided an update on our BCMA program with our canonical BiTE molecule AMG 420, showing durability out beyond a year in some multiple myeloma patients. AMG 701 our half-life extended BCMA BiTE molecule continues to advance nicely through dose escalation and we expect to present the initial first-in-human data at a medical meeting next spring depending on data availability. Before I leave oncology, I would note that we have paused our DLL3 and FLT3 CAR T programs in the Kite collaboration. We continue to have a keen interest in cellular therapies. However, in light of our growing confidence in the BiTE platform, we will maintain our immediate strategic focus on the BiTE molecules and direct our efforts and cellular therapy towards developing new-generation technologies likely through collaborations. Briefly in biosimilars. We received FDA approval for KANJINTI for all approved indications of Herceptin. The non-Hodgkin's lymphoma study of ABP 798, our biosimilar Rituxan has completed dosing and we expect to have the data in-house by the end of Q3. And finally, the FDA review of ABP 710, our biosimilar REMICADE continues to progress toward the BsUFA target action date in December. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay. Thanks, David. Ian now let's turn to questions. And out of respect for the fact that we started an hour later than usual, we'll try to move briskly through this, so if you could please remind our callers of the procedure for questions we can get started. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Ronny. Ronny Gal : Good morning. Good afternoon, very congratulations on a nice quarter. Biosimilars, I'd like to ask one on attacking and defending side. First, congratulations on the launch of the two biosimilars in the United States. For KANJINTI you have only the 420 mg and not the 150 mg yet. Can you give us a time line for when do you think you're going to get the lower dose then and do you think it will have an impact on the initial uptake? And on the defending side looking at Neulasta. Would you be able to share with us kind of like the trends in the clinic non-340B hospitals and 340B hospitals? Where is the adoption of biosimilars right now? Bob Bradway : Okay. Ronny. Thanks for the question. We'll take it in two parts. Murdo, do you have the answer to the first question on the 150? Murdo Gordon : Yes. So I don't have the exact timing for you Ronny but we're not seeing a whole lot of resistance in the market initially to the conversations we're having with payers, hospitals and providers. We're seeing good response to KANJINTI and MVASI and we feel good about our ability to compete with the presentations we have in the market right now. And then on Neulasta, we continue to see the effects of biosimilar competition as we had anticipated. We are seeing an uptick of biosimilars in the 340B channel. We're also seeing a stronger performance of biosimilars in business that we have not contracted. So again that is as we would have expected. But we're also seeing strong performance of Onpro on a unit basis quarter-over-quarter holding in a majority of accounts. And that's something that we had hoped to see by now and we're feeling good that that continues to happen. And overall, I think it's recognized in the market that the ability for Amgen to supply high-quality reliability on our overall long-acting filgrastim business is being appreciated and continuing to support that franchise. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray. Chris? Chris Raymond : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just on AMG 510. So kind of keen on your commentary on the tumor responses in CRC. So I wonder if you could maybe give some clarity here. Are these new patients that were enrolled and got maybe the 960-milligram dose, or were these -- I know you have had an option for patients to have intrapatient up-dosing. So any color there in terms of who responded would be great. And then maybe a second part of that question also on the registration trial starting this year. I know you said it's in lung, but just kind of wondering if you could give some color on the design in the setting and what constitutes maybe a control in third-line lung would be great. Thanks. Bob Bradway : Yes. Sure. With regard to colorectal, the majority of patients that we're reporting going forward will have been treated at 960 milligrams. As you may recall at ASCO, we only had I think one patient at that point who was on that dose level. And so we'll provide updates in that particular indication as we accumulate data towards the end of the year and the first part of next year when we have enough patients at the target dose to get a real sense of the clinical activity. In terms of potential registration plans, we would assume that lung cancer will be the lead indication going forward. As I mentioned in the coming days, we will be enrolling in the Phase II portion of that program. We're moving very, very rapidly and we'll provide updates on that particular pathway as we go forward. But I would say, we've had productive discussions with regulatory authorities and have a good sense of the pathways moving forward. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew. Matthew Harrison : Great. Thank for taking the question. I guess another pipeline question for me. Can you just clarify on the half-life extended BiTEs, what your view on the data that we may see in the fall and what that data needs to look like versus the canonical BiTEs that you've reported so far in terms of efficacy and safety to move those programs ahead? Thanks. Bob Bradway : Yes. I think Matt as we've said in the past in general, we will prefer the half-life extended program all things being equal meaning seeing efficacy and safety profiles that are comparable to what one would expect with a short half-life or a first-generation BiTE. Based on emerging data I think we're getting increasing confidence in the half-life extended program and we'll look forward to sharing those data across both hematologic, malignancies and solid tumors as we go forward. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse. Evan? Evan Seigerman : Hi, all. Thanks for taking the questions. So on your recent biosimilar launches in the United States, how do you really compete with the innovator of molecules? And I guess what structural changes do you need to see in the U.S. health care system to encourage more use of biosimilars? And what's your view on the broad use of rebates to protect branded biologics in light of biosimilar competition? So there's a few in there. Bob Bradway : Yeah. There's a few questions in there. I'll take these in parts. Go ahead Evan -- or sorry go ahead. Go ahead Murdo. Murdo Gordon : Thank you. Yeah. Evan, thank you. I mean the gist of your question seemed to surround the viability of the biosimilar market in the U.S. and I think in two parts, we are seeing a very healthy competitive biosimilar market evolve. We're experiencing competition on Neulasta and we anticipate being able to compete effectively with our new biosimilar launches with both MVASI and KANJINTI. I think competitively where Amgen differentiates is in the fact that we have four decades of high-quality reliable supply in the market. We are able to offer physician and patient educational services and reimbursement support. And we're also able to cover many of these customers, who will be making treatment decisions using our biosimilars given our strong history and experience in the oncology sector. I also think that the dynamics on pricing and competition while fluid are less of a barrier than they once were. And I think that we'll continue to see deeper and deeper penetration of biosimilars against originator products in the U.S. in the future. And I will just remind you that we have many years of experience now outside of the U.S. in Europe in biosimilars and I think the market in Europe started slow and has since become a very mature, very attractive market for biosimilars manufacturers. Bob Bradway : And I'll just add there Evan from a policy perspective there. Some in the industry who are advocating for changes that would favor biosimilars over the innovator molecules, we are not among them. We think that what the country needs is a long-term vibrant competitive marketplace for biosimilars, and our fear would be anything that tilts the playing field. Two biosimilars might perversely have the long-term effect of diminishing the competitive opportunity in the U.S. And we want to avoid what has happened for example in the small-molecule generic industry in the U.S., where there are unfortunate market abuses relating to the fact that there are single companies left with the license to manufacture individual generic products. So we think that for the long run what the country needs is a vibrant competitive market for biosimilars produced safely and reliably by competitors that can run a fair return for their effort. And we think we'll be able to do that without having to have policies that tilt the playing field in favor of those biosimilar molecules. Murdo Gordon : Thanks. And if I can just jump in to close Ronny Gal's earlier question. The FDA action date on KANJINTI 150 milligrams SKU is October 28, 2019. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Yaron Werber from Cowen. Yaron? Yaron Werber : Great. Thank you. And David I have a follow-up there also on 510 a little bit in two parts. Maybe the first one the -- what can you share with us on solubility or formulation of the compound? We understand that solubility is better and the gastric acidity a little bit lower than the intestinal. So what you see there on your journey especially on the formulation? And then on the CLC side, as you contemplate combo as the next stage now that you're seeing single-agent activity are you thinking a PD-1 combo or is that going to be a TKI combo next? Thank you. David Reese : Sure. So let me take both of those questions in turn Yaron. In terms of solubility, I would say broadly we've been very happy with the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of the drug. And again to remind everyone with a covalent inhibitor, the key is really to maintain exposures above a target level for a period of time that is adequate to poison the target through a dosing interval. And based on what we've seen in the clinic to date now across several dozen patients gives us the confidence that we've got a very attractive pharmacokinetic profile. In terms of colorectal cancer, obviously, combinations will be of great interest going forward, I would say potentially both with immunotherapeutic agents and additional targeted therapies. And as that program moves forward, we'll provide additional guidance a little later in the year and early into next year. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners. Geoffrey? Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much. I appreciate for taking my question. And I'll try and confine myself to three subparts. I guess, the main question that we have been still asked is about the Sandoz litigation. And I think we all expected that we would get a result from the district court by now. And I'm sure you can't really comment, but could you talk hypothetically perhaps about what your fallbacks might be if unexpectedly your issued patent was overturned? Should we be anticipating that there is a risk of rapid erosion of Enbrel, sort of, along in your last trajectory, or could you kind of give us some thoughts Bob on how the outlook is for that? Bob Bradway : Sure. Geoff, I understand that you're anxious for an answer from the courts and of course, so are we. We are as you know confident in the intellectual property surrounding Enbrel. So we don't know any more than you do about when we will expect that -- when we should expect that decision. But if for whatever reason that decision were to surprise us and go against us as you can imagine we would appeal that because again we feel that we have robust intellectual property for the molecule and we intend for that intellectual property be respected. So I think as to the hypothetical question about competition for Enbrel, we'll defer discussing that Geoff at this time. Thanks. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer? Umer Raffat : Hi. Thanks so much taking my questions. I had one question with three parts. It's all just a clarification. So thank you for that update on KRAS and you've mentioned formal tumor responses. I wanted to ask just to clarify; a, are these Reese's responses? Number one. Number two, can you confirm if it's more than one response in colorectal or you can only have one colorectal and one appendiceal? And finally also at what dose level? Thank you very much. Bob Bradway : Yes. So taking those three parts in turn. Yes these are resist responses, which is what I alluded to by saying formal tumor responses. It is a patient niche in colorectal cancer and appendiceal cancer. These many of the patients dosed have yet to have repeat scans done so we expect in the coming few months to have a large amount of additional data at the target dose. Recall that we just opened the expansion cohort not long ago and have had a flood of patients enrolling on that. We are continuing to see very good tolerability. I've been involved in Phase I drug development for a long time now, and I can say I'm only very impressed with the emerging safety profile that we are seeing with AMG 510. David Meline : Dose levels? Bob Bradway : Dose levels. Going forward it's all at the 960 milligrams. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Mohit Bansal from Citigroup. Mohit? Mohit Bansal : Great. Thanks for taking my question, and thanks Arvind for the shout out. A quick one on your Lp(a) candidate. Could you please compare and contrast your siRNA approach versus the oligonucleotide approach mechanistically? And should we expect some favorable results when you see the data later this year or early next year? Thank you. Bob Bradway : Yes. I'll be happy to address that question. So the question is around Lp(a). We've seen, I would say very encouraging data in the healthy volunteer portion of the first-in-human study. We are now dosing patients with elevated Lp(a) levels and expect to move into the next phase of that development program -- based on the promising clinical data that we've seen to-date in the early part of next year. Like the siRNA approach, I can't comment specifically on other's molecules and antisense oligonucleotides. In the long-term safety will be a critical component of any of these development programs. In addition, I would point out that something like siRNA will probably be required to tackle Lp(a) because of the nature of the molecule and the types of modalities that will be necessary to actually lower levels. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence? Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe Bob a big picture one. We've obviously seen a lot of M&A in the space recently. Just as you think about your capital allocation strategy how does the Enbrel litigation, I guess, fit into that? And again as you think big picture at what's going on in the industry how are you thinking about where Amgen can maybe play a role or a part? Thanks. Bob Bradway : I think, Terence as I said in my remarks, we have a strong cash flow, a strong balance sheet. We think the company is performing well. And we think we can grow the business organically and we're also looking at ways to grow through business development. So we're -- I'd expect that we will continue to be disciplined looking at opportunities and our stated areas of therapeutic interest in the geographic regions where we have stated our desire to expand. But again we have a world-class business development effort and we continue to look at opportunities large and small. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets. Kennen? Kennen MacKay : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Murdo on Neulasta. I guess, I was just thinking about your guidance on the majority of the erosion coming from the prefilled syringe. Should we think that this is basically gone now given that Onpro still commands, sort of, mid-60% of this market and sales are down, sort of, 30% since biosimilar competition, or have we basically seen the impact of the biosimilars or is there is still more erosion to come? Thank you. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks, Kennen. The trends that we're seeing are a function of obviously having now two competition -- two competitors in the market. And since the advent of the second competitor we've seen -- clearly seen more volume erosion and more price erosion. We are assuming that we could still see an additional competitor this year. And I would say that the current trends on the prefilled syringe will continue and we may see some price pressure on Onpro. What we are seeing with Onpro is stable unit evolution quarter-on-quarter and that makes us feel good about the differentiation that Onpro provides both physicians and patients and the convenience and persistency that it offers. I think looking forward we continue to think that this is going to be a competitive biosimilar place \u2013 space. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Jay? Jay Olson : Well, hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Thank you for taking the question. There was a recent German court ruling in favor of Amgen confirming that Praluent infringes on your PCSK9 patents. And I was wondering, if you could please share any thoughts you had on how market dynamics may evolve in Germany or other markets, if there are any where Praluent may no longer be available. Bob Bradway : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Jay. First, the European Patent Office upheld our intellectual property for Repatha and upheld the innovative contribution that we've made to the field with that product. The German courts found that they infringed obviously that IP and instructed them to \u2013 will be removed from the market. Sanofi filed an appeal and that matter is under review. Our focus of course will be on making sure that, whichever patients need a therapy are able to receive it and we think we're in position to be able to satisfy the needs of that market. But I think you're right that Germany is another market now where our IP has been upheld. As I said, the European Patent Office upheld our IP more broadly in that region. That follows Japan, which has also found in our favor. And of course, as you know, we've had two trials in court in the U.S. on the matter both of which where jury trials had found in our favor. So the IP process continues to move forward in Europe, Asia and the United States. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael? Michael Yee : Hey, great. Thanks for the question. David Reese on KRAS you talked about responses in colorectal et cetera. Maybe just going back to lung, can you comment on confidence around longer-term durability in monotherapy? And then to the comments around enrollment with the combination PD-1 talk about what you would expect to see there and when we could get first data as I \u2013 obviously, I would assume that's an exciting opportunity? Thanks. David Reese : Yeah, thanks Mike. Yeah, in terms of durability as I mentioned, we will be presenting a clinical update at the World Lung Conference in September. But I would say that to-date we've been favorably impressed with potential durability. We have to all recall that it's early days and many of these patients have been recently enrolled on trials, so we'll gain further insight into durability as time goes on. But at least, to-date we are not seeing for example the rapid emergence of resistance. In the PD-1 combinations, we have what I think are very strong preclinical data suggesting potential synergistic interactions between KRAS inhibition and checkpoint inhibition, probably due to enhanced immune infiltration and up-regulation of Class I MHC on tumor cells. And our goal with that kind of combination would of course be very long-lasting durable remissions. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Alethia? Alethia Young : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. One question and maybe one clarification. Just can you talk a little bit about in the Repatha situation with the co-pays like kind of where are the moving pieces there to kind of get the ball rolling? Is it just mostly negotiations? And maybe why is it occurring? And then on KRAS, are you planning on dosing beyond 960 in colorectal? Thanks. Murdo Gordon : Okay. So Alethia maybe I can start with the Repatha question, and then I'll turn it over to Dave. As you know, the PCSK9 market is a competitive one. And given that competition last year, there were payer negotiations and contracts that occurred, and since then some commercial access improvements have been realized. I would say that, our reduction of the \u2013 our introduction of the low list price Repatha in October of last year was to try to improve the Medicare Part D reimbursement, and we recognized at the time that we were off-cycle or mid-cycle in the normal process by which PBMs and other payers produce their Part D benefit designs. And so while we had hoped that some payers and PBMs would move quickly to add low list price Repatha to Medicare Part D formularies at a fixed co-pay that has not transpired. So we are optimistic that we will be able to make a significant improvement in Medicare Part D fixed co-pay listings for Repatha as we enter the 2020 Medicare Part D formulary benefit year, and we will know that in the fourth quarter. David Reese : Great. And in terms of dosing in colorectal cancer beyond 960 milligrams, as I mentioned we've enrolled right now a fair number of patients at that target dose. I think we'll look for insights from that cohort. It remains early in this development program. And with these drugs of course, there is often tweaking of dosing and scheduling as you go along. But I would say that at this point 960 is our target dose. We will assess emerging data to see if we want to explore some other doses and schedules going forward. Why don\u2019t we take two last questions, Ian, and then we\u2019ll wrap-up. Operator : Very well. Our next question is from the line of Do Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Do? Do Kim : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just on the acquisition of Nuevolution, I was hoping you could provide some context on the decision to acquire and bring the platform in-house versus just licensing additional programs or buying another company with assets in the clinical stage? And what is the plan for their existing collaboration and the potential for new ones? Bob Bradway : Yeah, sure. I'll be happy to address that. So, the Nuevolution acquisition actually grew out of a partnership that we had with them on programs that was quite successful. And when we looked at the breadth of expansion of that potential partnership, we thought that simply bringing them onboard made sense. In terms of their existing obligations, obviously those are things that we will fulfill as we move forward. I would point out that we plan on and have established them as Amgen Research Copenhagen, and they will remain a stand-alone Amgen research site going forward. And we're incredibly enthusiastic about what we think is world-leading technology. Arvind Sood : Okay. Ian, let's take one last question if there is one. After which, Bob will make a few closing comments, and then I'll close the call. Operator : Very well. Our final question is from the line of Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities. Salim? Salim Syed : Hey, guys. Thanks for the taking the question. Hey, Bob, I appreciate the commentary on M&A. I just had a follow-up on it. And I totally understand you're looking at how to grow the top line both internally and externally. But, I guess what would you say to what are the gating factors have been? Why haven't you done more M&A this year? Is it the science that you're not seeing something that you won or is it valuation? Is it FTC, or do you truly believe that the highest ROI you can get right now is just buying back your own stock? Thank you. Bob Bradway : I think Salim, we look at a range of opportunities. I think valuations have been stretched. It's been hard for us in some of the things that we liked to find transactions at prices that we think can earn a return for our shareholders. It's easy to earn a return for the target shareholders, where we're keen and focused on trying to earn the return for our shareholders. So, that's clearly been a consideration for us more than anything else I think. But again, we continue to look for opportunities and fully expect that by being disciplined we'll find ones that enable us to win for our shareholders and to invest in programs that can help us grow the company. So, we're optimistic. We're pleased that we have the resources to be able to move forward, and money is not burning a hole in our pocket. Arvind Sood : Okay. So, with that, Bob, do you want to make some closing comments? Bob Bradway : Sure. Let me just end where I started, which is to say that we're pleased with our performance through the first half of the year, and excited about our long-term prospects, which we think are driven in large part by what we think will be unit volume gains across a number of our important products, and excited as well about our innovative pipeline and the prospect of branded biosimilars adding to our top line. And let me just finally thank our Amgen staff around the world, who continue to help us deliver on our mission to serve patients while remaining focused on driving value for our shareholders. Arvind Sood : Excellent. Thanks Bob, and thanks to all of you for your participation. If you have any follow-on comments, questions, if you would like to continue the discussion, feel free to call us. The IR team will be standing by for several hours. Thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you greatly for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, this conference call will be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Slattery of Burns McClellan. Mr. Slattery, please go ahead. Bill Slattery : Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to the ChemoCentryx Third Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. Earlier this afternoon, the company issued a press release providing an overview of its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019. This press release, along with a few slides that you may find helpful while you listen to this call, are available on the Investor Relations section of the company's website at www.chemocentryx.com.  Joining me on the call today is Dr. Thomas Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer of ChemoCentryx, who will review the company's recent business and clinical progress. Following his comments, Susan Kanaya, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer at ChemoCentryx, will provide an overview of the company's financial highlights for the third quarter 2019 before turning the call back over to Tom for closing remarks.  During today's call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, which those of you following the slides can see, if you look at Slide 2. These forward-looking statements are based on current information, assumptions and expectations that are subject to change and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These risks are described in the company's filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 11, 2019.  You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and ChemoCentryx disclaims any obligation to update such statements. In addition, this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of this live broadcast, November 4, 2019. ChemoCentryx undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this live conference call. At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Tom Schall. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone listening. Thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2019 conference call. In the third quarter, I adopted a new mantra that I then called 4, 5, 6, which of those of you who are following can see on Slide 3, that is, we at ChemoCentryx had 4 clinical programs, yielding 5 data readouts over the then next 6 quarters. One quarter later, we are on track with this goal. Today, I will concentrate on the first top line data events for each of our first 2 drug candidates, the release of results from our pivotal Phase III ADVOCATE trial of Avacopan in the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis in mid- to late Q4, that is, this quarter and then I'll touch upon 2 studies of CCX140 for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS, in the LUMINA I trial, which is expected to have top line data in the first half of 2020, followed by the LUMINA II trial also next year.  Rounding out the last quarter's mantra of 4, 5, 6 will be data that we project in 2020 from 2 more trials of avacopan : the AURORA trial of avacopan in hidradenitis suppurativa, or HS; and the ACCOLADE study of avacopan in C3 glomerulopathy, or C3G. So as you can see, top line data will come fast and frequent as we enter the most exciting period yet in our rich and storied history here at ChemoCentryx.  As most of you are aware, on October 1, we were joined in New York by 2 of the world's leading nephrologists, Dr. David Jayne of Cambridge University in England; and Dr. John Niles of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. We hosted an R&D Day, went into great depth on ANCA vasculitis and FSGS and the unique mode of action of our targeting systems of the novel medicines : avacopan and CCX140, respectively. This meeting also featured a fascinating and powerful session in which Dr. Jayne interviewed an ANCA vasculitis patient. Ms. Dianne Shaw spoke movingly about the difficulties of living with this rare but ravaging disease, including how she and other patients attempt to cope with the devastating impact of the high doses of chronic steroids that are used in the current so-called standard of care.  We know ANCA vasculitis to be a neutrophil-driven disease where complement fragment C5a binds to the C5a receptor, or C5aR, which then drives neutrophils to inflame and ultimately destroy the body's blood vessels. Avacopan intervenes to make the C5a receptor pharmacologically inert or inactive even at trough levels of the drug in the body. Avacopan does so with exquisite selectivity. It does not inhibit the second and beneficial receptor for C5a, another receptor called C5L2, as Dr. Jayne pointed out at our R&D Day and as you can see from Slide 4.  This is important because the literature shows that C5L2 has a beneficial impact on inflammatory health. Indeed, evidence required us to design avacopan, and this was with considerable scientific effort to stifle the roles of the bad actors, C5a receptor binding the C5a, while allowing free reign for the good interactions of C5L2 with C5a.  So maybe it was no surprise when our Phase II CLEAR, randomized, controlled clinical trial of avacopan demonstrated that avacopan rapidly brought neutrophils to normal levels in ANCA patients while swiftly bringing active vasculitis under control, also while showing benefits across the total burden of disease in ANCA vasculitis, that is, with evidence of improving and stabilizing kidney function and even improving patient-reported outcomes and validated quality-of-life assessments.  Avacopan did all of this without the high doses of steroids that are currently used in the traditionally established standard of care for ANCA vasculitis. The Phase II CLEAR and the Phase II classic trials provided the logical building blocks in laying the foundation for the pivotal ADVOCATE Phase III double-blind, double dummied, randomized, controlled clinical trial. We expect to have top line data from the ADVOCATE trial between the middle to the end of this current quarter.  So what should you look for in these results? To help us follow this, please look at Slide 5. First, to the 2 primary end points. In the ADVOCATE trial, the first primary end point occurs at week 26 and answers the question can you effectively bring patients with an active vasculitis flare into a state of BVAS remission as measured by the traditional, but limited, Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score. BVAS remission is defined as having a BVAS score of 0 and being off steroids for the preceding 4 weeks. There is much to say about BVAS, and I'll briefly explain the limitations of BVAS in a moment. As we've discussed many times, the statistical null hypothesis is one of statistical noninferiority of avacopan therapy compared to chronic steroid-containing standard of care in achieving this BVAS remission.  Why is noninferiority the null hypothesis that is employed? Mostly, the answer is a pragmatic and arithmetic one. It is simply not feasible to power a study for statistical superiority in an orphan disease such as ANCA. The sample size, or N, would be too large for an orphan disease trial. Regulatory agencies understand this. So noninferiority with respect to the BVAS end point is the only pragmatic option available to us. In addition, BVAS only measures the ability to get through the active vasculitis crisis.  The steroid containing standard of care can get people through the initial crisis, but it does so at a great cost. And these other costs are not captured in the BVAS primary end point by its traditional design. So patients with ANCA vasculitis can still get into a so-called BVAS remission and still be quite unwell from the ongoing ANCA disease and from, and maybe especially from, the illnesses that are caused by the steroid therapy itself, these steroid induced problems being largely not scored in the BVAS assessment.  The second primary end point is a similar comparison of statistical noninferiority of BVAS remission at 52 weeks and is intended to answer the question can you keep a patient in BVAS remission following the acute crisis. I will note for all of us that avacopan has the same primary end point null hypothesis, that is, statistical noninferiority for BVAS remission, as was used in the preceding RAVE study, which, in fact, was the sole basis for the approval of rituximab being offered as an alternative to cyclophosphamide, both, of course, in combination still with noxious steroids. RAVE, in fact, was the only other Phase III pivotal trial that has led to an approval for a therapeutic entity in ANCA vasculitis. We plan to report both the 26- and 52-week primary BVAS end points in our top line data readout this quarter. Make no mistake, we believe that achievement of the noninferiority null hypothesis for BVAS remission constitutes a victory. But I'll admit, I don't like the term noninferiority because it sounds lackluster, a word that is completely at odds with our aim, which is nothing less than to revolutionize the standard of care with a 21st century medicine that meets the desperate needs of ANCA patients.  The second element that we plan to touch upon, therefore, in the top line data release features the total burden of disease, as we aim to establish avacopan as a superior profile of therapy in ANCA vasculitis. As I mentioned, the BVAS score itself is limited because it only measures active and acute vasculitis signs and symptoms. It is not a true reflection of whether a patient is well, and that is why our ADVOCATE trial aims to fill this gap by measuring a number of important secondary end points, as shown on Slide 5.  We hope that these will show that avacopan contributes to a meaningful benefit in other dimensions that are vital to patients and, indeed, to the health care system, including diminishing or arresting ongoing organ damage, particularly in the kidney, damage that accumulates with the use of steroids; also eliminating therapy-induced illness and improving the patient's quality of life and the ability to function normally. As you can see from Slide 6, the current standard of care is simply not safe, it's not fast and it's not durable. And it's not even inexpensive as some individuals who are not particularly well versed in this area have suggested because the relatively low-cost of purchasing steroids is illusory.  As to chronic high-steroid therapy, there's a more prevailing and informed view. That is the buying cost of steroids is dwarfed by the using cost of steroids, that is, the economic burden of steroid therapy. Consider here the vast economic burdens of the system of treating the profound side effects, illnesses and dealing with the deaths caused by the use of steroids. And I would submit that these economic burdens of steroid use, vast as they are, pale in the raw light of the human cost to patients, their families and their daily lives.  So now turning to Slide 7, we know from our many discussions with patient advocacy groups, with clinicians and with regulators that there's great interest beyond BVAS in alleviating the total burden of disease in ANCA vasculitis. Our previous results from our controlled Phase II trials make us hopeful that we can do exactly that. We are hopeful that the top-line data from ADVOCATE will demonstrate, as they did in the Phase II trials, with objective measures that avacopan improves organ function and quality of life with a favorable safety profile. Before turning to our second drug candidate, let me say a quick word about avacopan's potential to become a pipeline and a drug, shown on Slide 8. Before the end of next year, 2020, we expect to release top-line data of avacopan Phase II trials in 2 additional indications. First, in our ACCOLADE trial of avacopan for the rare kidney disease C3 glomerulopathy, or C3G, a life-threatening disease that typically strikes the young. There's no approved therapy for C3G. I'm very pleased to tell you that we recently received a $1 million grant from the FDA to support the advancements of our ACCOLADE trial.  We will present a post-run avacopan in C3G at the upcoming annual meeting of the American Society of Nephrology, or ASN, meeting this week. Second, our AURORA trial of avacopan in hidradenitis suppurativa, a disfiguring skin disease that's thought to implicate the C5a receptor. Again, the unmet need here is very high, and the commensurate commercial opportunity is significant. Beyond that, there could be many other indications for this versatile, small molecule with its unique mode of action, but for now we're clearly focused on delivering our prime objective of top-line data results. Let me turn now to CCX140, our orally administered inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR2. Please see Slide 9 where we describe two clinical trials : LUMINA-1 and LUMINA-2, which are underway for CCX140 in the treatment of another rare kidney disorder, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS. As Dr. John Niles from Mass General discussed during our R&D Day last month, there is no approved treatment for FSGS. However, steroids with their attended toxicities are frequently used. Our objective in the LUMINA trial studies is defined in terms of reduction of protein in the urine, or proteinuria, as the FDA has indicated that proteinuria lowering in FSGS could potentially be a registration end point.  And some of you may recall that proteinuria lowering was the metric we studied successfully in an earlier Phase II trial of CCX140. In that trial of several hundred patients with diabetic chronic kidney disease, CCX140 met its end point of rapid and sustained reduction in proteinuria while demonstrating a good safety profile. That successful study provided the basis of our work now in the orphan disease of FSGS because of its significant unmet need and owing to the facts that in FSGS cost, size and timeline for these kind of studies are wholly tractable for a company of the scope and stage of ChemoCentryx.  As you will see in Slide 10, we've completed enrollment in our LUMINA-1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial of FSGS patients with high levels of protein in the urine. The primary end point is reduction in proteinuria at 12 weeks. We expect to report our top line results during the first half of 2020. Our LUMINA-2 trial is a single-arm, open-label study of patients with nephrotic levels of proteinuria and primary FSGS, which is a rarer condition. We expect top line results of this trial during 2020. Again, at this month's ASN meeting, there will be a scientific poster represented on the LUMINA-1 trial and 2 posters on the novel role that CCR2 inhibition place in renal diseases such as FSGS. In summary, we stand on the threshold of a remarkable period. This gives us the potential for multibillion-dollar commercial opportunities in the U.S. alone, as you can see from Slide 11. When the ADVOCATE top-line data are released, we and the experts will be looking at whether ADVOCATE achieves statistical noninferiority in BVAS-based remission compared to the standard of care at week 26 and whether avacopan sustains BVAS-based remission at 52 weeks and also whether there are indicators that avacopan reduces the total burden of disease in ANCA vasculitis.  Following ADVOCATE, we look forward to reporting out top-line data of avacopan in C3G and HS during the course of the coming year. Excitingly, this may just be the beginning of the avacopan franchise. And then we'll look forward to releasing top-line data from both our LUMINA-1 and LUMINA-2 trials during 2020 as part of our other major program with CCX140 and FSGS where the lack of approved or effective treatment shows an urgent unmet need. And so we move forward from last quarter's mantra of 4, 5, 6 to now what I call program 2020-4 sights, that is, after this quarter's top line readout from ADVOCATE where I personally believe that we are well positioned for a positive readout propelling us to an NDA and other regulatory filings, we look beyond as well, 4 major data readouts in 2020 or 2020-4 sights. As we like to say in ChemoCentryx, the future has never been closer or more exciting and what a compelling time it is for clinicians, patients and shareholders alike.  Now let me turn the call over to Susan Kanaya, who will describe our strong financial position. Susan? Susan Kanaya : Thank you, Tom. Our third quarter 2019 financial results were included in our press release today and are summarized on Slide 12. Revenue was $10.6 million for the third quarter compared to $9 million for the same period in 2018. Revenue is recognized based on the proportion of cost incurred as a percentage of the total budgeted cost to fulfill the performance obligations under our avacopan and CCX140 commercialization agreements with Vifor Pharma.  Research and development expenses were $18.1 million for the third quarter compared to $15.1 million in the same period in 2018. Phase II clinical expenses increased in 2019 primarily due to patient enrollment in the avacopan AURORA trial in patients with HS and the 2 CCX140 LUMINA trials in patients with FSGS. These increases were partially offset by lower expenses for the avacopan ADVOCATE Phase III pivotal trial as the study was fully enrolled in the second half of 2018.  General and administrative expenses were $6.1 million for the third quarter compared to $5.4 million in the same period in 2018. The increase from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to higher employee-related expenses including those associated with our launch readiness efforts and higher professional fees. We recorded a net loss for the third quarter of 2019 of $12.9 million compared to $10.9 million for the same period in 2018. Total shares outstanding at September 30, 2019, were approximately 58.3 million shares. Lastly, we ended the third quarter with $205.8 million in reported cash, cash equivalents and investments, and we expect to close the calendar year with more than $185 million in cash and investments. Tom? Thomas Schall : Thank you, Susan. My final slide is Slide 13. As you can tell, we are well placed to deliver on our plan and our promise with 6 top-line data readouts expected between now and the end of this coming year. Consider this, we have an excellent track record of program execution over many years. We have a plan for bringing our new medicines to market, with ChemoCentryx owning the U.S. market entirely and our capable partner Vifor Pharma preparing an ex U.S. international launch with excellent economics for ChemoCentryx. We have a strong financial position so that we can run these multiple trials, get the data readouts and submit our regulatory filings to the FDA and EMA including those for positive data after ADVOCATE. And after ADVOCATE, we look forward to the next year with 2020-4 sights. For all these reasons and more, I believe ChemoCentryx represents an enterprise of value like few others in the industry.  I'll now turn the call back over to the operator and we look forward to your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Steve Seedhouse from Raymond James. Steven Seedhouse : Looking forward to data later this quarter. My first question is can you share the split or the rough split or qualify in some way how many patients would have received Rituxan or cyclophosphamide in ADVOCATE even if it's on a blinded basis? Or if not, was there anything in the protocol to ensure a minimum number of patients on either of those regimens? Thomas Schall : Steve more details to come, of course. I don't have the exact details to give to you today. I will say this that we modeled the rituximab cyclophosphamide usage pretty much how the geography where the trial was going to be mapped out. So approximately about 1.25 or 1.3 rituximab to every 0.6-or-so cyclophosphamide just given the global distribution. And so I have no reason to believe that we'll be too variant from that, but I just don't have the details at this moment. Steven Seedhouse : Okay. That's still helpful. And could you maybe also, on the secondary end points, speak to which of those on the entire list, or whichever ones you might highlight, are adequately powered to hit a nominal p-.05 and which may not be powered for that type of nominal p-value, even if the result favors avacopan numerically? Or are they all theoretically well powered? Thomas Schall : I think the short answer is they're all theoretically well powered rather and, of course, the details are -- for example, when you have quality of life, you actually have several categories within quality of life. And so the question is, is there a way to talk about those in aggregate or do you talk about categories individually. In Phase II, we talked about categories more or less individually, but it was very clear, 6 of 8 of those categories in the SF-36, by way of example, was statistically p less than 0.05 in advantage to avacopan relative to the baseline readings and relative to the standard of care. So we're fairly optimistic that with the larger N in the ADVOCATE trial, we'll be able to show reasonable p-values across a number of very important secondary end points and in short we tried to power the numbers appropriately to at least show folks where we thought we were seeing meaningful benefit in some of those areas. Steven Seedhouse : Okay. Are there any milestones from your partner associated with Phase III either hitting the primary end point or subsequently filing for approval or subsequently approval that we should be aware of? Thomas Schall : Susan, I'll let you take that question. Susan Kanaya : Sure, Steve. The milestones are not tied to clinical but are indeed tied to regulatory events. Steven Seedhouse : Okay. And are you able to disclose ranges or what those amounts would be? Susan Kanaya : No. We haven't done so. But I think the CMA gave you a guide at least for one piece. But tied to approval would be the likely next one and then think about other territories that may trigger additional regulatory milestones. Operator : The next question is from Michelle Gilson from Canaccord. Michelle Gilson : Can you just talk about given the baseline characteristics and severity of the population you hold in ADVOCATE and kind of the lower dose GC regimen that landed within the control arm? Could you just talk about what expectation should be in the first 26 weeks around safety, maybe infections and also other GC-related tox? Are there any toxicities that we should be keeping our eye on that should expect to be more predictively observed within the GTI and within the control arm that we should expect avacopan to improve on substantially? And then just one more. Which of those toxicities within the glucocorticoid toxicity index contribute the most to the overall QC economic burden in ANCA? Thomas Schall : Wonderful questions, Michelle. Thank you so much. When we think about glucocorticoid toxicities in these trials, I think we have a couple of different things that inform our ideas and informed how we set up ADVOCATE. So number one, we're using more or less the same steroid regimen that we used in CLEAR. So we certainly have some experience with what I call the more modern practice of the GC regimens over 6 months, which is a little bit lower than what was used historically and incrementally lower than what was used in RAVE but not -- again, not too much lower but a more modern practice I would say.  When we took in aggregate the normal serious adverse event categories related to GC use, things like incipient diabetes, bone fractures, weight gains, psychiatric disorders and infections and maybe a couple of others as well, we and others have used that as a sort of basket of common glucocorticoid-related SAEs and safety events over the history of this and other indications. As we knew from CLEAR, overall, we had a significantly -- a significant fewer number of those events in aggregate with avacopan therapy versus the standard of care. Certain categories were very interesting. And again, we'll just have to see what happens with the greater end.  So we'll use that same bucket of categories that's been traditionally used. And again, I'm optimistic that we ought to be able to show in aggregate significantly fewer events with avacopan than with the standard of care. We're also using this fairly newly developed glucocorticoid toxicity index, which is very data rich indeed, there's lots of stuff that goes into it, and it was developed by John Stone and colleagues of Mass General. We are probably the first trial, blinded trial of scale, to really look at how that will read out.  So I won't make too many comments on it yet, but I'm very keen to look at how that might be a service to us and others as we truly look in detail and in depth at the effects of glucocorticoids. It is notable too in clinical trials that infections -- we're all interested in infections. RAVE was interesting because, as you probably know, the average rate of serious infections in RAVE was about 11%. Across that study of 200 patients in two arms, both arms were getting the glucocorticoid regimen. In the real world, people believe that serious infections are maybe double or even more than double that rate. So I always like to remind people that in clinical trials, patients are superbly well looked after.  Moreover, they are taking a lot of note about their own health. And so symptomatology, that might go to a serious infection, in real-world practice, will get caught earlier in clinical practice and a clinical trial and people will get therapy for those events a lot earlier. So it's not unusual to see diminished rates of infection in a clinical trial setting over what is known from real-world evidence. Nevertheless, we are very optimistic, again, that we'll be able to show -- we hope we'll be able to show as we look to those events that there should be significance in difference in aggregate and maybe trends in some of the individual categories with glucocorticoids.  Clearly, economically, to get I think to the final aspect of your question, it's interesting. Obviously, hospitalizations are a huge burden on the health care system. Infections drive a lot of that. Infections and rehospitalization for infections is a big driver. But it's by no means the only driver and, in aggregate, may not even be the main driver when one also considers certain things that are not often talked about like fairly severe significant psychiatric issues that require care, usually quite urgent in acute care, very expensive care. And then there's the other what I call the sleeper of glucocorticoid use, and this shows up in mostly quality-of-life metrics, but it's been shown in looking at just GCs a little bit in a more focused way, and that is a diminished sense of vitality.  So if you look at SF-36, there's a category for vitality. Now that sounds like a very vague term, but the largest part of the vitality score comes from chronic fatigue. And that's important in a very broad economic way because that's what keeps people out of the workforce. So I get asked a lot about the vitality component of quality-of-life assessments, which, in the CLEAR trial, we had a significant improvement over 12 weeks in vitality in the SF-36 from that trial. And I'll remind everyone it was a blinded trial, so we didn't know that result until the unblinding, and it was really quite remarkable to folks that follow that sort of stuff, so that is also a big economic feature and one that will factor into discussions around this and other programs going forward. Michelle Gilson : Okay. [Technical Difficulty]. Thomas Schall : Michelle, with apologies, you're cutting out. So I am not -- I only caught maybe every third word of your question. Michelle Gilson : I'm sorry, [Technical Difficulty]. Thomas Schall : Not really, no. Michelle Gilson : [Technical Difficulty]. I'll follow-up with you later. Thomas Schall : Okay. Thank you. I do apologize, but we and others couldn't hear what you were asking. Operator : The next question is from Anupam Rama from JPMorgan. Tessa Romero : This is Tessa filling in for Anupam tonight. We had 2 questions today centered on ADVOCATE. The first one being will ADVOCATE potentially have more renally involved patients? And what impact might that have on the results here coming this quarter? Thomas Schall : I think the -- as we look at the big population of all ANCA pop people, it's pretty well known that ultimately, over time, about 75% of folks will manifest renal dysfunction and ultimately, over time, fairly severe renal dysfunction. So again, I would expect that what we'll see will not be out of line with what we saw in the Phase II programs. And I wouldn't expect a big variance from that. And again, I won't quote a number since we'll be releasing data this quarter. But let's put it this way, frankly, I don't think it matters much whether it's a renal dysfunction, a pulmonary dysfunction, an ENT disorder.  Our mechanism of action really speaks to the damage that is caused at the end of the process and arresting that damage and putting the system back in a situation where we don't have chronic inflammation and eventually vascular necrosis. I think David Jayne actually brought this up very astutely at the R&D Day where Professor Jayne pointed out that, in a strange way, the 2 major forms of ANCA disease, and for those that are not totally initiated yet, they are something called GPA or MPA, and they more or less relate to the kind -- one or 2 antibodies, autoantibodies, that shows up : anti-proteinase 3 or anti-myeloperoxidase. And in a strange way at a genetic level, they're different diseases because those antibody -- the production of those autoantibodies is caused by 2 different lesions. But the point is once the antibodies are present, the neutrophils get primed, and these autoantibodies also act as a kind of stimulator of chronic complement activation leading ultimately to C5a production, which then binds the C5a receptor on these prime neutrophils, and that's really what causes the damage. So the beauty of our approach is, because our mode of action is very targeted and targeted at what actually causes the disease and the destruction, I really don't care if it's MPO or PR3. And I think that when we looked at our generally, the features across the patient population from the Phase II development program, I think that, that was borne out. Admittedly, numbers are fairly small from Phase II, but it certainly supported the idea that our mode of action should be reasonably effective irrespective of whether the primary pathology seems renal or otherwise.  And so I'm very optimistic that we're going to get a good effect. I welcome kidney patients because I think there's a profound economic driver to the opportunity with renal involvement as, ultimately, renal involvement and its care in ANCA vasculitis is staggeringly expensive. So if we can help those folks, and we showed in Phase II that the evidence suggested that we could, at least in the context of that development program, I think that's a very powerful feature. Operator : The next question is from Dae Gon Ha from SVB Leerink. Dae Gon Ha : Congrats on all the progress, look very much forward to the ADVOCATE data this quarter. So I guess, just one question on the ADVOCATE. Tom, can you just remind us, are patients stratified for their baseline steroid use coming into the study? And perhaps as you're -- like you said in your prepared remarks, you're engaging in a lot of commercialization effort, so perhaps if you can speak to what you have found in terms of the major disconnect in the physician community or even in payer community. And then the second question is on AURORA. It looks like the enrollment pace is picking up pace, you now have 80% of sites activated, 55% of patients enrolled. So in light of the SHINE data last year, I was just wondering can you perhaps talk about quantity over quality as you get these underway. What efforts are put in place to avoid the unusually high placebo rates that those InflaRx folks saw? Thomas Schall : Sure. Sure. Sure. So let me take the HS stuff first. Yes, we're probably, as of today, even way beyond the 55% that you quoted. So you're right, enrollment has picked up considerably. And we've taken great pains to make sure the quality stays high in this trial. We want a definitive result. We don't want a nonresult. So among other things, we'd taken great care in site selection. And in fact, I will just say and it's probably a matter of record in our filings, we're actually a U.S. trial with the AURORA trial at this point. And so we believe that some of the placebo response seen in other parts of the world at least will have some greater control up here.  More to the point and more important however, we've done extensive training and we've tried to centralize a lot of the discussion around the primary end point, the HiSCR. Everyone must get past the ability -- or they're trained before they are validated for the trial or the sites are activated for the trial. We have monthly training in HiSCR. We have very active outreach. We have people in the sites all the time, reminding them of what we need to do in HiSCR. And then if things come through in the blinded data on the scoring through successive assessments, there are actually alerts that our team go out and say, let's make sure we're using consistent criteria. Let's make sure you're using the checklist and the notes, et cetera. So we believe that we'll be able to standardize that a lot more fundamentally.  Moreover, we have not created the expectation, I believe, based on randomization ratios that patients -- the majority of patients will get active drug or at least the dose of active drug that people -- most people think will be clinically active. So other trials probably predispose themselves to the expectation, again leading to a higher placebo response. I think some of the randomizations were -- I'm not remembering entirely, but maybe 4 :1 or 5 :1. So the vast majority of folks were thinking they were going to get an active substance. We've got a very strict 1 :1:1 randomization. And in fact, one of the doses is a, what we believe, to be, while clinically interesting, probably a suboptimal dose. So that's another feature.  Suffice it to say that these and other features -- really, we've been obsessive about making sure that, to the extent possible, we will reduce the ability for the placebo response to confound us. Being an orally active drug as well, we don't have the active infusion process. That we know from other indications historically has contributed to placebo response. So I think the variety of factors lead us to make sure that we won't be in the same situation, we should get a very definitive answer. Last thing I'll mention is that our N is bigger so that even if placebo response is higher than, say, the PIONEER studies and should allow us to capture authentic deltas. So we put a lot of time, thought, energy and training into this. I'm pretty convinced that we won't have confounding features there.  Let me go back to the idea about GC use disconnects, et cetera. It's highly protocolized what happens with GC exposure prior to randomization in ADVOCATE. And the exclusion criteria are pretty severe. Most folks basically have to come into the trial in flare. So in our position we don't have -- if they're on chronic GC, they are not eligible for the trial. The only way they can come into the trial with a new flare, either new diagnosis or a relapse. Yes, it is true that many people, not a majority interestingly, but many people may see GCs during workup prior to randomization, we allowed for that in CLEAR, and we allow for it with exactly the same rules in ADVOCATE and again, that's highly protocolized and rules driven, and it will not confound our results. We knew that from the CLEAR trial.  So yes, they have to get steroids that are in the kit. So they don't have discretion about whether they're getting steroids that are nonkitted, nonprotocol. Any other steroids that are supplied are recorded rigorously and essentially will determine whether those people are still in the protocol or not. So I think we've got a very good setup. It's consistent with what we did in Phase II. It's consistent with all of the best guidance from current KOLs about what best practice is now. So that's why I think the ADVOCATE trial is again very tightly designed and designed to give us, I think, an important and clear result.  Oh yes, I will come back -- you said -- you asked a question about disconnect. So interestingly, the disconnects are more with the casual observer. I probably get more of the question about aren't steroids cheap and effective from the investment world than certainly the clinician world. With the clinician world, I never get that kind of question from real experts. Sometimes people on the periphery might mention it, increasingly less frequently. I have never ever in 6 years in working in ANCA vasculitis, never ever once heard that from a patient. So I think the disconnect is one of perception. And as you get more and more to the center of this disorder, you don't hear it. Interestingly too, payers are much more sophisticated on this question than I think the average person or industry give them some credit for. Payers appreciate the economics of steroid use. And in fact, I really borrowed the statement of the use of buying pales in comparison to the use of actually using the steroids in the clinic, the cost of therapeutic burden. So I think that paradox is now being resolved and the people that matter : patients, clinicians and payers, really aren't disconnected as much as maybe laypeople or people that are not close to this field. Operator : The next question is from Ted Tenthoff from Piper Jaffray. Edward Tenthoff : I really appreciate the detail you provided about differentiation between other studies and the labor you put in to really trying to design ADVOCATE. My question is sort of [indiscernible] since we've had so many on the clinical program kind of roll forward a little bit. And assuming positive data, you mentioned that FDA and EMA filings could come next year. What has to be done to sort of get those going beyond clinical data submissions? And then even looking a little bit further, what should we be starting to anticipate for early commercial preparation? Thomas Schall : Great. Yes, Ted, obviously, that's the key question on our mind as well, or key set of questions. We, of course, assume success. I think we believe in success based on the data from the previous trials and all the blinded data and the preponderance of all the information we have. So naturally, we must plan for success in ADVOCATE. An NDA filing in the United States is quite a profound undertaking. We understand that deeply. We have assembled a regulatory team here at ChemoCentryx now over the past couple of years, which is I believe one of the best in the industry.  They have multiple, in fact, among the team, many dozens of NDA filings and launches under their belt. We have a raft of recent FDA personnel on the consultant role. And so I think we're moving along beautifully and putting together all of the necessary components of the future NDA filing. And we're really well on track to do that. Once we have our top line data, again, we believe we'll be well within industry standards in terms of time from top line to the ability to file the NDA. And of course, the NDA requires obviously, a finalized clinical study report, all your CMC has to be in shape, et cetera, et cetera.  We, I must say, for a small company, I'm really proud to say that we anticipated a lot of these questions, and I must say we've had the benefit under the previous so-called prime designation in Europe of understanding what we needed to do to get in shape for a licensing application. And so we had some -- a little bit early heads-up with that, and that was great. So we got ahead a lot of the critical questions. I won't go in any -- to the details today. Suffice it to say, we're very cognizant of CMC, we're very cognizant of drug supply, we're very cognizant of all those things beyond just clinical data that need to go in these applications. And these have all gone really, really well, and we've had many discussions with a variety of regulators. So in the U.S., we're in great shape, and we are building our commercial infrastructure as we speak. So a big part of our growth plan, Ted, and already our people on staff doing all of the stuff that will go into how we market avacopan in the United States where, as you know, we own it 100%.  We have a great partner, a very capable partner in Vifor Pharma and their partners, Fresenius Medical Care and, in fact, avacopan will be marketed, I believe, through their joint company Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma in their strong spots throughout the world, and then they sublicense commercial rights to Kisei [ph], and this is all public information in Japan, so all the same to us. They've got a great commercial infrastructure. They've been doing lots of work to sort of plug-and-play both avacopan and eventually 140 into their commercial field force ex U.S. I'm very impressed with what they've done. And it's great for us because the economics are really quite good.  We will take down off top line aggregate cumulative sales in all of their territories, royalties from the top line ranging from the teens to the mid-20s based on very shallow sales tiers. So I'm a big believer in Vifor Fresenius and Kisei getting every last dollar of sales because it all goes to the top line and potentially gets me to another tier. That works out great, and we have approval -- filing and approval milestones as well in those other territories.  So economically perfect for me and ChemoCentryx and our shareholders. So I think that this is going to be something that you'll all be impressed with as we start talking about more of these details getting into the coming year 2020, so that we can anticipate a great launch right after PDUFA. So more to come on the details but I assure you this takes up a huge amount of our time and effort here. Edward Tenthoff : Excellent. Well, I agree with your sentiments that it took some exciting time at the company, wishing you well in the first data readout. Operator : Your final question is from Ed White from H.C. Wainwright. Edward White : I think all of my ADVOCATE questions were asked except for one. You were talking previously about pharmacoeconomic data. Will you have an actual study or a publication around the ADVOCATE -- end-of-day ADVOCATE trial or will you have at least pharmacoeconomic data in hand once the drug is launched? Thomas Schall : Absolutely, Ed. I hope the answer is yes to both of your questions and, in fact, already is in process. We are doing a lot of work on the pharmacoeconomic prospects for the drug. There'll be more data coming out from others as well as some of our own data coming out over the next year about the health economics surrounding avacopan and its opportunity. Naturally, we plan on putting out not just one but a series of papers in the referee journals talking about the data in some detail. So that plan is really well established here. And again, once we get through the top line readout, I think you'll see lots of information coming out in what I call a fast and frequent way, one hopes, that will help you address all these questions. Edward White : And then the other question I had was just on C3G with the ACCOLADE study. So it's now 60% enrolled. I think the last time we had talked about it you had said the first stratum was almost 100% enrolled. Is that fully enrolled now? And we can just assume that all the other patients are from the second stratum of patients? Thomas Schall : Ed, I would say it's nearly fully enrolled in the first stratum. And you're right, disproportionately, we're getting more of that second stratum. So we'll -- I'll have more to say about the details of how we're going -- the trial conduct and what we plan to do in the coming quarter. Operator : There are no further questions at this time, sir. Thomas Schall : Well, with that, I want to thank everyone for joining our call today and all the excellent questions. For those of you who will be at the American Society of Nephrology meeting, we look forward to seeing you and then subsequently updating you further in the near future as we make progress this quarter and beyond. So you may now disconnect, thank you again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Okay. Thank you, Ian. Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for joining us today. So 2019 was the year and that we made significant progress on our strategy and took steps that position us well for what will surely be a special year in 2020 as we celebrate our 40 anniversary. What better gift to celebrate this important milestone than to get back to revenue growth. So, our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will lead the discussion today. We are also joined today by our new CFO, Peter Griffith, who will provide a financial update on our results for Q4 and full year 2019 and provide guidance for 2020. Our Head of Global Commercial Operations, Murdo Gordon, will then review our product performance followed by our Head of R&D, Dave Reese, who will provide a pipeline update. We will use slides to guide our discussion today and you should have received the link separately. We will also use non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our results, actual results, to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Arvind and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining our call . Heading into 2020, we feel ready for the challenges of a new year and we're feeling encouraged by the progress we made in 2019. Once again, this past year, we met and exceeded our financial targets. We advanced key elements of our long-term growth strategy and we serve more patients around the world with our growing portfolio of medicines. 2019 was the transition year, we had long been preparing for as many of our off-patent legacy products faced new competition. I believe we managed this transition well, as evidenced by the fact that we delivered earnings growth in 2019 and will return to top line growth in 2020. In 2019, drug prices in the U.S. actually fell overall for the first time since 1974. In anticipation of this challenge, we re-positioned the company's expense base and embedded productivity initiatives over the past several years that are serving us well. In addition, we reshaped our product portfolio committing to medicines that can deliver growth for us primarily through volume increases rather than price increases. Products like Repatha, Aimovig, Prolia, Evenity, and most recently Otezla. In 2019, we delivered 3% volume growth globally and 19% volume growth outside the United States. We're seeing especially strong performance in our Asia-Pacific region, albeit from a small base. Over the next decade, we expect this region to account for as much as 25% of Amgen's growth. For the full year in 2019, volume in the region grew 62%. Over two-thirds of that growth came from our joint venture with Astellas in Japan, the world's third-largest pharmaceutical market. Just a reminder that this collaboration reverts fully to Amgen on April 1st, enabling us to do business in Japan, through a wholly-owned subsidiary for the first time. Our strategic collaboration in China with BeiGene closed a few weeks ago and we're excited by what our two companies can achieve together in the world's second largest pharmaceutical market. 2019 was also a watershed year for us, for our biosimilars business. We've delivered our first several biosimilars to market on time and on budget and we believe we are in the early innings of what can be an important growth opportunity for us over time. Through the end of Q4, the business was already annualizing at over $1 billion and we will add to our portfolio later this year with the launch of Avsola, our biosimilar to Remicade. We also expect that Amgevita, our biosimilar to Humira in Europe and other parts of the world will benefit from our recent acquisition of Otezla. A key pillar of our growth strategy continues to be bringing to market first-in-class or best-in-class medicines that deliver a large effect size for patients suffering from serious illnesses. The world is growing older, wealthier, and more urban and these mega trends mean that the world will need more biopharmaceutical innovation, not less. We intend to be a leader and delivering that innovation. We expect several important data readouts from our pipeline in 2020. We expect data for AMG 510 or KRAS G12C inhibitor for tezepelumab in allergic and non-allergic asthma for omecamtiv and heart failure and look for Otezla in mild-to-moderate psoriasis. In addition, we'd expect to generate some important data across our BiTE portfolio in 2020 as well and Dave Reese will provide details on all of this shortly. Last year, we also expanded our commitment to discovery research, strengthening our world-leading human genetics capabilities through a number of collaborations while adding large scale proteomic data as well. We remain excited about how our approach is enabling us to identify and pursue new targets and the patients who stand to benefit most from them. Everything we see in our company and across the industry continues to make us feel that we're living in an incredible age of biotechnology innovation. Across diseases, we're seeing more and more reason to be optimistic about the next breakthrough for patients. At the same time, we know that governments and individuals who are struggling with how to pay for these breakthroughs. We accept responsibility to be part of the solution, both in advancing innovation that really matters and in providing innovative ways for patients to get access to it. In an election year, there is bound to be much discussion about health care and we look forward to engaging with other stakeholders to promote market-based solutions that promotes innovative medicines and affordable access to them. Just as we recognize that we need to be a constructive stakeholder to help sustain the robust ecosystem that exists for biotechnology innovation in the U.S., so to do we recognize and accept the need to be part of the process of addressing other environmental, social, and governance matters that are of concern in our communities today. To that end, several years ago, we set targets for reducing our carbon emissions and water consumption by the year 2020. Having hit those targets in 2019, a year earlier than planned, we are now developing a next set of goals that we will share later this year. These goals will include a further commitment to our next generation manufacturing technologies, which have a much smaller environmental footprint than traditional biologics manufacturing and enable us to operate at a lower cost too. Now, let me turn over the call to our new CFO, Peter Griffith. You'll recall that Peter joined us in October, and he will take you through the details of our performance in 2019 and our outlook for 2020. Peter, over to you. Peter Griffith : Thanks Bob. Let me begin by saying how happy I am to join Amgen at such an exciting time in the company's 40-year history. I also want to take a moment to thank, David Meline, the Amgen team, as well as many of you on the call who have helped me transition into the role. Over the last several months, I've enjoyed meeting many of our investors as well as members of the analyst community and I look forward to the continued dialog and engagement. Now, let's turn to the fourth quarter financial results on Page 6 of the slide deck. Revenues at $6.2 billion decreased 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, we saw worldwide product sales declined 2% to $5.9 billion as our portfolio transition with declines in our mature products substantially offset by our growth and launch products. We are particularly encouraged by the strong 21% volume driven growth from our ex-U.S. markets, which gives us confidence as we continue our global expansion including into China, which will also benefit from our collaboration with BeiGene, which closed earlier this month. Foreign exchange had a 1% negative impact to fourth quarter worldwide sales on a year-over-year basis. Other revenues at $316 million were up $87 million versus Q4 2018. Our Q4 non-GAAP operating income at $2.6 billion decreased 4% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 44.6% for the quarter, compared to 45.3% in Q4 of 2018. As previously indicated, our operating expenses reflected the typical underlining - underlying fourth quarter pattern, increased investment in our rapidly evolving oncology pipeline portfolio and additional operating expenses associated with the Otezla acquisition, which closed in Q4. These increases were partially offset by continued favorable expense impacts from our productivity initiatives across all operating expense categories. Other income and expenses were a net $65 million expense in Q4, representing $132 million of year-over-year favorability. This favorability was driven by gains generated from liquidating bond investments to fund the Otezla and BeiGene transaction and favorable market value fluctuations of publicly traded securities held in our venture's portfolio, partially offset by lower interest income due to reduced cash balances. The non-GAAP tax rate was 14.9% for the quarter, a 1.6 point increase versus Q4 2018, primarily due to a one-time prior-year tax benefit associated with intercompany sales under U.S. corporate tax reform. Non-GAAP net income was $2.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 6% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, supported by a 7% reduction in share count versus Q4 2018. Next, I will review our 2019, full-year results on Page 7 of the presentation. Our 2019, full-year revenues decreased 2% to $23.4 billion, while our non-GAAP earnings per share grew 3% to $14.82 per share. For the full year, we saw a 1% decline in worldwide product sales to $22.2 billion. Volume growth in markets outside the U.S. was 19% year-over-year. Other revenues at $1.2 billion were down $56 million year-over-year. For the full year, non-GAAP operating income at $11.2 billion decreased 6% from the prior year and our non-GAAP operating margin was 50.2% for the year, down from 52.6% in 2018. In total, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% year-over-year to $12.2 billion. This growth was driven by Research and Development investments, launch product support, and the addition of Otezla to our business, partially offset by our productivity program. Other income and expenses were favorable by $250 million on a year-over-year basis due primarily to gains in 2019 from liquidating bonds to fund the Otezla and BeiGene transactions, partially offset by lower interest income resulting from reduced cash balances. The non-GAAP tax rate was 15% for the full year, up 1.5 points versus 2018. Again, primarily due to a one-time prior-year tax benefit associated with intercompany sales under U.S. corporate tax reforms. Turning next to cash flow in the balance sheet on Page 8. For the full year 2019, Amgen continued to generate strong cash flow, reflecting a diversified portfolio of products coupled with an industry-leading cost structure. Free cash flow was $8.5 billion in 2019 versus $10.6 billion in 2018. The decline driven by lower net income, timing of working capital, and an advance tax deposit. In 2019, we returned a total of $11.1 billion to shareholders through dividend payments totaling $3.5 billion and $7.6 billion used to repurchase $40.2 million shares at an average of $190 per share. And this followed the $21.4 billion return of capital to shareholders in 2018. Cash and investments totaled $8.9 billion at the end of 2019, a decrease of $20.4 billion from the end of 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by the Otezla transaction, cash return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases as well as debt repayment. All partially offset by free cash flow generated during the period. Debt outstanding at year-end totaled $29.9 billion and carries a weighted average interest rate of 3.7% with an average maturity of 12 years. Now turning to the outlook for the business for 2020 on page 9. 2020 and will be another important year for Amgen, as we continue to invest in the pipeline to generate innovative and differentiated molecules build out the global business and support the growth of our new products. As previously discussed in anticipation of this opportunity and continued downward pressure on net prices, we developed a productivity capability to enable us to fully invest from a position of strength. Our 2020 revenue guidance is $25.0 billion to $25.6 billion and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $14.85 per share to $15.60 per share. GAAP earnings per share guidance is $10.85 per share to $11.65 per share, which divergence from non-GAAP EPS, primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to our Otezla acquisition. Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance is 13.5% to 14.5% and once again, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year, including our industry leading environmentally friendly next generation manufacturing facility in Rhode Island. Let me mention several key assumptions embedded in our guidance. First, our revenue guidance range reflects continued strong worldwide growth from products including Prolia, Evenity, Repatha, Aimovig, Otezla and our biosimilar portfolio. At the same time, we expect increasing competition against our filgrastim and ESA franchises, as well as Sensipar. Next, with regard to net selling prices, we experienced a 5% decline globally in 2019. For 2020, we expect to again experienced low to middle single digit declines globally. We expect our volume growth to more than offset the net price declines. Overall, as previously stated, excluding Otezla, we expect our base business to be stable in 2020 on a year-over-year basis. As you model revenue in 2020, note that historically the first quarter represents the lowest product sales quarter of the year. As a percent of the full year, product sales for the first quarter should look similar to the percentage we saw in Q1 of 2019. Murdo will explain further in his remarks. With respect to other revenue, we expect about $1.1 billion for the full year 2020, as we anticipate increased competition against our royalty product portfolio. From an operating expense perspective, overall we expect 2020 total non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the low double-digit percentage range year-over-year on an absolute basis. As previously communicated, we reiterate the following three assumptions. Non-GAAP R&D investment to increase as we invest in our advancing innovative pipeline programs and new Otezla indications partially offset by R&D recoveries received from our BeiGene collaboration. Second, non-GAAP SG&A expense to increase due to the acquisition of Otezla as well as modest incremental investment in support of our base business, as we continue to expand globally, including China and Japan. Grow our biosimilars business and begin product launch preparation for our late-stage pipeline. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be generally consistent with 2019. We expect all expense categories to continue to benefit from our productivity program. We anticipate non-GAAP other income and expense to be a net expense in a range between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. This is primarily driven by lower interest income as a result of cash used to fund the Otezla and BeiGene transactions as well as our 20.5% share of BeiGene's results based on current publicly available consensus estimates. I know that our 20.5% share of BeiGene's results will be booked one quarter in arrears in accordance with the equity method of accounting and therefore begins in Q2, 2020. As you know, on April 1, 2020, Amgen will purchase the 49% of shares in Amgen Astellas BioPharma that are held by Astellas for a nominal fee, making the company a wholly-owned Amgen subsidiary. First, let me say how excited we are about this transition as it marks the achievement of a long-term strategic objectives. We look forward to further leveraging this platform as we seek to bring Amgen's new medicines to patients in the third largest pharmaceutical market. From a financial perspective, we anticipate limited near-term financial impact resulting from this transition. Now, with regard to capital deployment, our actions will continue to reflect the following principles. First, we will invest in our business to expand our pipeline of innovative medicines and to seek to drive long-term volume growth globally. We will also invest in prudent external business development opportunities. Second, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders in the form of growing dividends, including the 10% increase in the first quarter of 2020 or $1.60 per share, as well as continued share repurchases. We will continue to take an opportunistic view towards the timing of share repurchases within '20. We expect share repurchases within a range of $3 billion to $5 billion and have an authorization outstanding in the amount of $6.5 billion. And third, we remain committed to maintaining an optimal capital structure in order to minimize our weighted average cost to capital and retain our investment grade rating. Consistent with our usual practice, our guidance today does not include the impact of potential external business development activities. So in summary, we delivered another year of strong financial results in 2019 and we remain confident in the outlook for Amgen's success in 2020 and beyond. This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call over to Murdo. Murdo Gordon : Thanks Peter, and good afternoon everyone. I'll take a few minutes to reflect on 2019 and then review Q4 in greater detail. In the 40 years since incorporation, Amgen's product portfolio and geographical footprint has changed dramatically. On our 40th anniversary, we reflect on the pioneering innovative spirit of our early Amgen employees that transformed the treatment of disease. Our mission to serve patients remains unchanged and it motivates us every single day. Our accomplishments on behalf of patients in 2019 give us further confidence about our future as we enter 2020. To summarize 2019, for the full year, we grew volume by 3%. The growing proportion of our portfolio posted 35% year-over-year volume increases. This portfolio is diverse and includes products such as Prolia, Evenity, Repatha, Aimovig, Otezla, Amgevita, our six hematology and oncology brands as well as MVASI and KANJINTI. Finally, our international business contributed 19% volume growth in 2019. Notably, year-over-year revenues for our businesses in China and Japan grew nearly 8 fold. These markets are long-term growth engines for Amgen and our collaboration with BeiGene along with our acquisition of Otezla will accelerate our expansions in the second and third largest pharmaceutical markets. Now moving to fourth quarter results. Volumes grew by 3% year-over-year. In Q4, net selling prices declined 4% year-over-year, resulting in reported net sales declining by 2%. As Peter mentioned, we have a stable outlook for our base business for 2020 and with the addition of Otezla, we expect revenue growth this year despite projecting continued declines in net selling price on a portfolio basis. Now getting into product details, Prolia delivered 15% growth year-over-year, driven by higher volume from increasing rates of new patient growth and strong repeat injection rates. Recall that given twice a year dosing, Prolia experiences consistent seasonal trends. Evenity posted $85 million in the fourth quarter, driven by strong uptake in both Japan and the U.S. Every year, worldwide 8.9 million fractures occur due to osteoporosis. That's one fracture every three seconds and only 20% of women who experienced a fracture are treated with a bone-building medicine. Given the under-penetrated nature of this market, we continue to focus on ensuring postmenopausal women receive appropriate screening, diagnosis, and treatment. With Prolia and Evenity, we have excellent treatment options to offer these patients. On to Repatha, Q4 sales grew by 26% year-over-year, as we continue to be the leader in the PCSK9 class worldwide unit growth was 67% year-over-year and new to brand U.S. prescriptions are steadily improving growing at 61% year-over-year, we've taken significant steps and have made major progress in improving access and affordability for Repatha. We removed the original list price offering. We simplified and improved prescription approval rates and commercial plans and we have increased the percentage of Medicare patients up to 70% that can access Repatha at a more affordable co-pay. Although the blended net price of Repatha in the U.S. declined in Q4 versus the previous year, net selling price was relatively stable sequentially. For 2020, we expect a step down in Repatha's net selling price in Q1 based on our contracting to obtain broader access with stabilization thereafter. Now onto Aimovig on Slide 16. On a year-over-year basis, volume grew 27% while net sales grew 3%. As a reminder, Q4 2018 benefited from $20 million of favorable changes in accounting estimates impacting the year-over-year comparison on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Unit volume grew 9%. To date, almost 300,000 patients have been prescribed Aimovig by more than 33,000 prescribers. Considering that there are 4 million migraine patients in the U.S. who are eligible for CGRP treatment, Aimovig has significant potential remaining to penetrate this market and we expect to drive volume growth over the course of 2020. Aimovig leads in both new to CGRP prescriptions and total prescriptions, which exited Q4 with a 48% TRx share. Aimovig has exceptional access with over 80% of prescriptions paid and over 92% of the lives covered. As a result of this broader access, we expect net price to decline slightly on a full year basis for 2020, when compared to the full year 2019. Additionally, Q1 has lower sales in subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance re-verifications, and greater co-pay expenses as patients, work through their deductibles. We'll move to Parsabiv on Slide 17, which grew by 49% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Independent and midsize dialysis providers already utilize Parsabiv for a majority of their calcimimetic patients while FMC and DaVita continue to increase adoption. Next onto Otezla. With the help of the dedicated professionals that have joined our team from Celgene, we will continue to drive strong sales growth and launch potential new indications for Otezla. During the period since acquisition closed, prescription momentum continued with 13% year-over-year growth. Our seamless integration efforts, combined with planned label and geographic expansion gives us confidence in our ability to grow Otezla at low double-digit compound annual growth rate over the next five years. For the approximately five weeks post closing in 2019, Otezla sales were $178 million. We expect first quarter sales to be proportionally lower than in the remaining quarters of the year. The quarterly pattern for Otezla in 2020 should approximate the historical pattern over the last number of years. Moving on to Enbrel sales increased 2% year-over-year driven by a $66 million favorable change in accounting estimates and increases in net selling prices, partially offset by unit volume declines. Volume trends in 2020 are expected to be similar to those in 2019. As for net selling price, we project limited benefit in 2020 versus 2019 due to less favorable contract terms. With two highly complementary products, targeting psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, we see an opportunity to strengthen their positions in the market; more broadly, we're increasing our focus in inflammation through our broad portfolio, which includes our biosimilars, Amgevita, and Avsola. Our late-stage asset tezepelumab and a number of other earlier assets in the R&D pipeline. Now to our hematology and oncology business, which is highly integrated with our oncology biosimilars that I'll discuss later. Our innovative portfolio of six brands XGEVA, KYPROLIS, Nplate, Vectibix, BLINCYTO, and IMLYGIC collectively totaled $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 10% year-over-year. As for some of the larger brands within this portfolio, XGEVA grew 7% in Q4 year-over-year driven by 4% volume growth. KYPROLIS grew 6% year-over-year driven by volume led by a 12% increase in the U.S. - in U.S. sales. Nplate grew 15% year-over-year driven by volume. Our investments in R&D for Nplate have resulted in two innovations. First, we recently launched a smaller presentation at 125 mcg in support of in Nplate's pediatric indication, as the product is administered with weight-based dosing. This new presentation will also help to minimize general product wastage for ITP patients across all indications. Second, Nplate received approval in October for the treatment of early ITP, which gives us the chance to serve patients earlier in the course of their disease and provides the opportunity for treatment free remission. Now onto our more mature brands, in Q4 Neulasta sales declined 43% year-over-year with a 42% decline in the U.S. Recall that Q4 of 2018 benefited from a $55 million BARDA order, which did not repeat in Q4 of 2019. Coinciding with the emergence of U.S. biosimilar competition, the most recent CMS published ASP for Neulasta reflects a 10% reduction. Bear in mind that ASP is calculated two quarters in arrears. On a volume basis in Q4, U.S. Neulasta retained an exit share of 74% of the long-acting segment with Onpro holding an exit share of 55%. We are encouraged by Onpro's durability demonstrating confidence that our customers have in the reliability and quality of our supply, along with our broader customer services. We now face a third biosimilar competitor in the U.S. and other potential competitors remain and development. As you model, Neulasta sales for the first quarter, recall that Q1, 2019 benefited from a $98 million BARDA order that we do not project to recur in 2020. Finally, outside the U.S., sales declined 48% in Q4 and we expect those trends to continue. Switching to Nephrology, starting on slide 25, Q4 EPOGEN sales declined 20% primarily due to lower net selling price from our contractual commitments with DaVita, which calls for a further price reduction in 2020. Meanwhile, Aranesp declined 10% year-over-year driven by lower volume due to increased competition. Regarding Sensipar, recall that in the U.S., there were several at risk generic launches in 2019 that resulted in year-over-year sales declining 76% to $107 million in the quarter. In 2020, supplemental patent protection certificates for cinacalcet expire in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, which will likely result in a significant decline in ex-U.S. sales in 2020. I'll close the product section with our biosimilar portfolio, which is highly integrated with our innovative business throughout the company. As examples, a majority of these products were made with the same manufacturing network as our innovative brands. We also leverage the same supply chain for distribution. And on the commercial side, we continue to identify synergies in commercializing our biosimilars alongside our innovative products, making it a highly efficient selling model and allowing us to rapidly apply learnings across our portfolio. We also offer the same provider and patient services as with our innovative portfolio. These advantages are increasingly important as we now face additional biosimilar competition to KANJINTI and MVASI and expect other competitors to enter during 2020. Our Q4 biosimilar portfolio comprised of KANJINTI and MVASI in the U.S. and Amgevita, KANJINTI and MVASI outside of the U.S. recorded sales of $258 million. In the U.S., KANJINTI and MVASI each recorded $79 million of sales and we've seen very encouraging adoption rates in the clinic segment and hospital adoption is accelerating. Given the early stage of launch, there is also some inventory stocking during the quarter. Ex-U.S. sales from our biosimilars where $100 million led by Amgevita. We continue to see important differences between products and markets in terms of uptake and price erosion with some markets experiencing strong uptake at more discounted pricing levels, while other larger markets including Germany and France exhibit a more balanced and sustainable opportunity. Here again, we're able to leverage our expertise and footprint in oncology, while Amgevita efforts synergized nicely with Otezla. In summary, 2019 was a solid year given the evolution of our product portfolio. In 2020, we plan to drive volume uptake of our growth portfolio of products, now including Otezla while defending our mature brands. Let me now turn it over to Dave Reese. Dave Reese : Thanks Murdo and good afternoon everyone. As we enter 2020, we are looking forward to important clinical data from programs across our three therapeutic areas, inflammation, oncology, and cardiovascular disease. I'll say more about oncology in a moment, but I'd like to take the opportunity upfront to express our enthusiasm for the BeiGene collaboration. We're off to a good start and look forward to working together to advance the global development of our pipeline of innovative oncology molecules. I'll now begin my quarterly review in inflammation. We expect Otezla data this year from a Phase 3 study in over 500 patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis that have failed topical therapy. This patient population has no approved oral therapy available and we are confident that Otezla may provide a much needed treatment option. We're working with the CHMP toward a Behcet's indication in Europe and with the FDA on inclusion of the scalp psoriasis data in the U.S. label this year. There are also ongoing studies for new indications, including pediatric psoriasis and we're evaluating additional studies to expand the opportunity for Otezla. I'll also remind you that later this year, we expect Phase 3 data from our TSLP antibody, tezepelumab in development with AstraZeneca and severe uncontrolled asthma. In bone health, along with UCB, we were pleased to receive European approval for Evenity for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture. Evenity is the first new osteoporosis medicine approved in Europe in the last decade, a testament to the need for a new therapy that can rapidly build bone. Turning to oncology and hematology, we continue to rapidly advance the development program for AMG 510, our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor. We enrolled the potentially pivotal Phase 2 monotherapy study in advanced non-small cell lung cancer in approximately three months and look forward to sharing data later this year when we have at least six months follow-up on all patients. I previously mentioned that we had enrolled a cohort of advanced colorectal cancer patients in our Phase 2 monotherapy study. Based on the data we have generated to-date, we have opened the study to further enrollment and we'll assess our potential development path in colorectal cancer as additional data become available. We also expect to present additional data later this year from our first-in-human monotherapy study in solid tumors, where we will have more information on duration of therapy as well as data and tumor types other than lung and colon cancer. We also expect initial data from our Phase 1 combination study with KEYTRUDA in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. We are enrolling advanced colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer patients in our MEK inhibitor combination study as well as treatment-naive non-small cell lung cancer patients in our ongoing Phase 1 monotherapy study. We continue to plan additional studies primarily combination trials and we'll provide updates as the program progresses. We remain enthusiastic about our BiTE platform in 2020 will be an important year. Based on emerging evidence of anti-tumor activity in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, we are growing increasingly confident in the half-life extended format. As we advance our BiTE clinical programs in different tumor settings, we are gaining important insights into dose and schedule and management of adverse events such as cytokine-release syndrome. These insights will guide customized development approaches, depending on the target and underlying disease biology. Over the course of the year, we anticipate sharing data from some of these programs and I'll provide further guidance on expected data presentations as these molecules advance. We are now pursuing two half-life extended BiTE programs for gastric cancer and recently initiated a first-in-human study for AMG 199, which is directed against MUC17, a target widely expressed in gastric cancer. Gastric cancer, as you know is highly prevalent in East Asia, where we have a growing presence through our impending Japan subsidiary and collaboration with BeiGene. As I previously discussed, we intend to present the data for AMG 701, or half-life extended BCMA BiTE when we have a meaningful dataset, most likely in the second half of this year. We've also made several regulatory submissions in oncology, including the KYPROLIS CANDOR study in the U.S., KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone in China for relapse and refractory multiple myeloma and BLINCYTO in China for relapsed-refractory AOL. We look forward to working with BeiGene to advance these important medicines. In cardiovascular disease, along the Cytokinetics, we look forward to the data from the omecamtiv mecarbil Phase 3 outcome study in the fourth quarter of this year. While the heart failure treatment landscape is expected to change based on recent data from other drug classes, we believe significant residual unmet medical need remains in this global epidemic. Also in cardiovascular disease, our LP(a) siRNA, AMG 890 continues to advance and we expect to initiate Phase 2 development in the first half of the year. Finally, on biosimilars, we're pleased to receive U.S. approval for Avsola, our biosimilar Remicade and to make our U.S. regulatory submission for ABP 798, our biosimilar Rituxan. I'm also pleased to announce that we are initiating a Phase 3 study with our 7th biosimilar ABP 938, our biosimilar aflibercept or EYLEA. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay. Thanks, Dave. Ian, why don't we open the lines up for questions now and please remind our callers of the process. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from line of Jay Olson from Oppenheimer & Co. Jay? Jay Olson : You talked a little bit about net pricing dynamics for Aimovig. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on how you expect the competitive dynamic to shape up in the CGRP space and any long-term data, you could potentially leverage there? Thank you. Murdo Gordon : Thanks for the question Jay, it's Murdo here. We're very pleased with Aimovig's market access position now with over 92% of covered lives, having access to Aimovig at a very affordable co-pay. We're also pleased with the addition this year of CVS, last year we did not have CVS as a benefit - with Aimovig as a benefit. And we do as of the beginning of this year and we've already seen and acceleration in our new patient uptake. We are happy that the percentage of patients that are receiving paid prescriptions now of Aimovig is above 80%. And that bodes well for the future growth of this category because we've got highly effective medicines that have an impact, a significant impact on the reduction of migraine days on migraine sufferers. And we have a lot of them, there is 4 million eligible patients out there in the U.S. and they're able to access Aimovig at a very affordable co-pay. So that's good for the future outlook of the category. Obviously because we did contract to secure that additional access, there will be a reduction in our net selling price that you'll see in Q1 and then we expect it to be relatively stable over time. Now, because this is a retail benefit product, you do see some fluctuations, as you make true-ups in the mix of your product that comes through Medicaid commercial or to some extent Medicare Part B. But overall, we would expect post Q1 stability in net selling price. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael? Michael Yee : I had an R&D question for David. Of course there is a lot of attention on AMG 510, you made a lot of great comments about how you quickly enrolled the study and we're going to get data later this year. One of the things I picked up on was your comments about first-line lung? Can you just maybe make a comment about how that advances or how that progresses or how you go about a first-line strategy that's obviously a huge opportunity, so maybe just comment about where that monotherapy study goes and where you can go with first-line? Thank you. Dave Reese : Yes thanks, Michael. That is intended to provide a potential treatment option for patients who are not eligible for other first-line lung therapies or unwilling to take such therapies. I think it will provide incredibly valuable clinical information on response to the drug in a previously untreated population. We've just started enrolling that, so over the course of the year as we generate data, we'll provide guidance as to when we may have some things to share. Operator : And our next question is from line of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Chris? Chris Raymond : Just on M&A priorities so Bob I was kind of struck a couple of weeks ago in San Francisco. You guys talked about renal as maybe an area of interest in terms of building out the pipeline and you're offering and obviously augmenting what is a pretty formidable business now. But I think the wording that I heard you say, Bob was that any asset you bring in, would have to be game changing. So maybe two parts can you talk about the reasoning for this sort of focus on renal or at least articulating that to us. And then what are you really looking for in terms of the game-changing therapy? Thanks. Bob Bradway : Yes so, Chris just to remind you we have six commercial franchise areas, of which nephrology is one obviously that was our first. We've been a leader in that area now for several decades. We have a number of important products for nephrologists today and we intend to continue to serve the needs of patients and physicians and providers et cetera in that community. We have not found in our own discovery research efforts that we've been able to find the kinds of game changing innovation that we want to invest in from a discovery standpoint. So we're not investing in discovery research in nephrology right now, but we are going to look for business development opportunities there and in general our strategy when it comes to the business development is to look for medicines that make a big difference for patients suffering from these diseases. So we'll look for innovation and large effect size. I don't know that I use the word game changer. But if I did, that's what I was intending to reflect the notion of large effect size innovative medicines. So to the extent, there are some in the industry or otherwise medicines, where again we think because of the historical investment we've had it with this community patients\u2019 that we can add real value, we'll look. Operator : And our next question is from line of Brian Skorney from Robert W. Baird & Co. Brian? Brian Skorney : One quick one - actually two quick ones on housekeeping, just it looks like compared to last quarter, you saw a 6% decline in Neulasta market share. Could you just breakout how much of that was Onpro loss and can you also talk about how Onpro price has been impacted by the biosimilars have been able to maintain price so far or have you taken greater discounts to maintain that share? Thanks. Bob Bradway : Okay, those are good questions for Murdo. Why don't you go ahead Murdo. Murdo Gordon : Yes thanks, Brian. The majority of the share decline is from the prefilled syringe. Onpro exited at a 55% share of long-acting filgrastim and continues to hold up well in terms of share. We have had a contract out there that provides some discount to Onpro, but it's a more modest discount, then you would see on the prefilled syringe. Operator : And our next question is from line of Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse. Evan? Evan Seigerman : One on biosimilars so what are some gating factors to achieve, I think it's multi-billion or you had at one point said greater than $3 billion in sales across the franchise. And if there were to be implementation of an international pricing index for most favored nation clause for Medicare Part B. How would this potentially impact your biosimilars business? Thank you, guys. Bob Bradway : I can take a stab at the first part of your question and Murdo, I invite you to jump in. But since we made those undertakings before you were part of the team Murdo. The notion that we articulated was that we were going to advance the portfolio of up to 10 biosimilars that we expected that these could be an attractive growth opportunity for the company and we're off to a good start, as you heard me say earlier. At the end of the fourth quarter, we are annualizing in excess of $1 billion. So we're off to a good start. We're on time. We're on budget with these programs and the gating item is simply product approvals and product launches. So we remain enthusiastic about our chance to earn a return from these products and it adds to the specifics of IPI, just to say in general. We obviously would be concerned we think quite a few other stakeholder groups would as well about the disruption that IPI would represent to the innovative biopharmaceutical industry. And we think there are better ways to evolve our system in a way that ensures patients have access to medicines at affordable prices, but Murdo feel free if you want to add anything specific about IPI in biosimilar landscape. Murdo Gordon : Nothing on IPI, Bob I think you summarized it well and on the biosimilars, the only thing I would say is I'm thankful to have inherited this portfolio and for the decisions that were made prior to my arrival. I think this is a strong business opportunity. It's been one, we've been able to realize very good competitive share in Europe and we're off to a very good start in our early launch in the U.S. And I look forward to being able to launch more products. Operator : And our next question is from line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets. Kennen? Kennen MacKay : I totally agree it was transformative. Maybe for Murdo, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the synergies you're seeing or expecting between selling of both Otezla and Enbrel and whether there were any tailwinds there to year end formulary rebating or contracting negotiations. We should think about in pricing or access in the year ahead? Murdo Gordon : Thanks for the question, Kennen. Yeah we're excited about potential synergies between Otezla and Enbrel, and quite frankly by extension our biosimilars business coming into the inflammation category. Too early to comment on specifics, but we continue to work through our contracting strategy, promotional strategy even things as simple as possibly expanding into primary care promotion because we have a fairly large primary care footprint. And then clearly, our international geographic expansion is augmented by having Otezla joining our portfolio with potential new markets where perhaps Otezla was slated to be launched by distributors when we have a full blown affiliate in some of those markets. And then the last pieces of course synergies as we go into some of the new indication areas. So I'm excited about building those. Our teams are working hard to realize those synergies, and I feel optimistic that we'll be able to be more specific in upcoming quarters. Operator : And our next question is from line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer. Umer Raffat : I am just extraordinarily confused today on the guidance, but I'll limit my question two specific things perhaps. First, Peter on the OINE line, if you can bear with me for a second, you mentioned $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion and I was trying to think it through and I thought to myself $30 billion debt at just above 3% rate, so that's $1 billion as an interest expense, minus about $100 million of the interest income. So that's $900 million, so when you guide to $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, that's effectively implying $300 million to $500 million for BeiGene. But my understanding was you're only booking 20% and I'm just trying to understand is BeiGene's implied net income $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion or am I thinking about that wrong, because that sounds so much higher than what BeiGene does. That's number one. And secondly on revenues. I noticed - I know the business is being implied flat year-over-year outside Otezla, so I just want to understand better what the pushes and that pulls are there and perhaps also I think it mentioned biosimilars doing $1 billion in 2020 annual 4Q '19 alone was north of $1 billion run rate, so just trying to understand all this. Thank you very much. Bob Bradway : Okay Umer. Let's try and go through that, I think there were three questions there. So Murdo, you want to take the first two on the revenue, just clarify what we said and then Pete, you can help clarify the other interest and expense line. Murdo Gordon : Sure. So yes, we have guided that our base business will be stable year-over-year, obviously there are a range of outcomes on that portfolio and we continue to work hard across a number of opportunities to do as we've done historically and that is to outperform. I would say that Otezla has come in and we have seen very good seamless integration of that team and that performance of that product and the growth trajectory continues with - without any interruption through the fourth quarter and we're seeing strong weeks early in the New Year. On biosimilars, it's very early in the launch of those two products, where we are annualizing as you pointed out at over $1 billion based on fourth quarter and we expect to be able to continue to accelerate that business. Peter Griffith : Umer, Peter here. Thanks for your question. I would take you to the fact that our total debt at the interest rate I talked about in my remarks at 3.7% average maturity 12 years, by the way, I mentioned that too. That plus the 20.5% of BeiGene's results for 2020, the publicly available consensus estimates are what we're guiding to. So when you work through those two, you should get pretty close to our $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for 2020. Operator : And our next question is from line of Robyn Karnauskas from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Robin. Robyn Karnauskas : I don't want to beat a dead horse, but I guess I'm confused too just by this lack of growth given that your slides have outlined, Neulasta, you've lost like half Onpro's holding, you're growing like a bunch of different products. So what is the one thing you think that is going to prevent you from growing more this year and not just having a stable business year-over-year, like that's sort of what I'm struggling with the most, just help me understand that because the way you describe, it looks like more growth of the top line. Thank you. Bob Bradway : Sorry Robyn, repeat the last piece - last piece of your question. Robyn Karnauskas : Sure. The way you're describing our your business is in your slide performance basically is that you're growing many parts of the business and the part that is declining is Neulasta, it seems to be potentially stabilizing with Onpro. So what is preventing you from growing beyond what you're guiding, is there one particular thing, I think most of us sitting there saying why can't you grow more than what you've outlined given the picture that you painted of the business being actually quite strong. Peter Griffith : So I would agree with your last comment, the picture of the business does look quite strong. We're pleased with what we've been able to achieve, particularly in the back half of last year. As I mentioned earlier, some of the Neulasta stability with Onpro has been at the expense of contracted terms, which lowered the net price of that total portfolio inclusive of Onpro and we would expect with additional competitors against Neulasta in the biosimilar space that there will be further net price erosion in the long-acting filgrastim category and of course, overall in our total portfolio worldwide, we would expect single digit net price declines for the year. Now, that goes up against what I talked about throughout the call is we have a number of really strong growth drivers in a young portfolio, very diverse products, and we have guided a wide range on revenue and it's my hope that the strong execution we saw in the back half of last year continues into this year and we can achieve a good growth profile, not just in Otezla but in the base business. Operator : And our next question is from line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence. Terence Flynn : Omecamtiv is a product you guys haven't talked a lot about recently obviously some Phase 3 data coming later this year, Dave, you mentioned it in your, in your remarks as well in terms of kind of the change in treatment landscape, but just curious if you could remind us of the puts and takes for the program, as we think about the probability of success here and what would really get you guys excited that type of data? Thank you. Dave Reese : Sure Terence. This is Dave. I'm happy to address that. I mean, as I mentioned in my remarks, heart failure is a global epidemic, what makes us continue to have excitement in omecamtiv, it's a first-in-class mechanism of action, it's the only drug ever introduced that actually acts directly on the heart cell to improve contractility or the heart's pumping function and we're conducting what'll will be a definitive 8200-patient or give or take trial in patients with advanced heart failure, it's a fairly sick population, where we're going to be looking for mortality benefit and a variety of other clinical outcome measures that improve. So I think there is a large amount of residual unmet medical need and obviously where this fits in a train changing treatment landscape will depend on the profile that emerges from that Phase 3 trial. Operator : And our next question is from line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein Research. Ronny. Ronny Gal : Good afternoon and congratulations on the nice 2019 and got one housekeeping and one question. The quick one is, I was wondering if you could give us your comment on the Medicaid block grant that just was announced today. Does that has any relevance to you and then generally, where do you expect it will impact the drug industry. And second, David, I was wondering if you could give me your - your view on the modest lung catering paper suggesting in the targeting the active GDP bound form of KRAS is better than trapping the GDP KRAS in the inactive form in terms of preventing tumors and tumor resistance to those agents. Bob Bradway : Good. Well let me - I'll knock off the Medicaid piece first Ronny, for those who are on the call who aren't aware, CMS released some guidance earlier today, so we and others are still chewing through it. I think you'll have very limited impact at first read of it for us, but it's likely to be relevant for those states that didn't opt into the ACA in the first instance and we'll go through it as well, I'm sure others in our industry, more closely to see whether there are any specific issues, for our business, but it didn't seem to me Ronny that that was going to be a concern for us in 2020. Dave, you want to tackle the one please. Dave Reese : Yes. I'm sure you don't want to address that one, Bob. So, we look - for those who aren't familiar, Ronny's referring to paper that came out within the last month or so that suggests that also targeting the GDP bound form of KRAS G12C would be required for signaling inhibition. We read the paper with interest, of course, I'll make a couple of observations. First, I would say our own data with AMG 510 suggest that at the appropriate doses and doses that we can achieve clinically, we can completely suppressed signaling throughout a dosing interval. It is also my understanding or belief that the G12C inhibitor used in that paper may have been a little less potent and one thing that we've learned over 40 years in oncology is that if you in completely inhibitor target, you very quickly breed resistance. So I would say, I feel very confident based on the preclinical data that we've generated with AMG 510 and we're of course profiling tumors across our clinical program to try to generate signatures of response and resistance. This is the sort of thing that we'll look at. But I don't see anything in the literature as of yet that dissuades me from the approach we're currently taking. Operator : And our next question is one of Mohit Bansal from Citi. Mohit. Mohit Bansal : And a quick question on Otezla in mild-to-moderate psoriasis, it seems like you will have data later this year, but given that net of tax rate is kind of a standard of care in that particular market and is a generic, what sort of challenge do you anticipate placing baseline in that market and how do you think about navigating those challenges there? Thank you. Dave Reese : Yes. Well, let me start Mohit and then I'll ask Murdo to jump in. So in mild-to-moderate psoriasis, there are currently no approved oral therapies. The only thing really available to patients right now is topical therapy, many of them will not ultimately experience disease control with those topical therapies and so we think there is a real opportunity for Otezla in that area. There are up to nearly 6 million patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis in the United States alone. So that gives you a sense of the size of this opportunity and actually the prevalence of the disease. Murdo. Murdo Gordon : Yes and Mohit, the only thing I would add is, yes, there is some methotrexate use there, but it's largely a topical business as Dave described and it's largely a patient population that gets very little relief. And this is really a patient population that is in the sweet spot for Otezla. The other thing I have to say is that our new colleagues when building out their positioning strategy for Otezla and their payor strategy have done a very, very nice job of positioning the access and reimbursement for Otezla as a post topical pre-biologic option. So I think for the mild-to-moderate population if we're successful in securing that indication that same payor strategy will be continued. So, I feel confident that we're in good shape there for another source of growth for Otezla going forward. Bob Bradway : So Ian, I know we've got several calls or several questions still queued up, so we will try to get through those apologies that were beyond the top of the hour here, but let's go onto the next question. Operator : Certainly. Our next question is from line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew. Matthew Harrison : I just wanted to follow up on a comment that Dave made earlier in the call, suggesting I think that - that maybe you're seeing some activity in HLE-BiTE in both solid tumors and liquid tumors. Maybe you could just characterize for us what - what data you have internally that gave you the confidence to make that statement? Thanks. Dave Reese : Yes. Thanks, Matt. And I assume that someone would pick up on that statement. So what I would say is, I'm not ready to declare victory in any indication yet, but we're seeing the sort of pharmacodynamic activity and early suggestions of anti-tumor activity that are reminiscent of the early days of BLINCYTO and that give us encouragement that we're on the right track. I'd also point out that we undoubtedly have the largest experience in the world in development of bispecific T-cell engagers, as I noted in my remarks, we've learned an enormous amount about dosing and scheduling appropriate management of adverse events and I think all of that is starting to come to bear right now and we're starting to see some of these hints in that in the HLE or half-life extended format. So again, I'm not ready to declare a victory, but we're seeing signs of encouragement and we'll be ready to share some of those data as the year goes on. Operator : And our next question is from line of Do Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Do. Do Kim : Just one on Aimovig, you've talked previously about expanding the primary care prescribing base. How would you go about doing that and could you do it with your current sales force? Dave Reese : Yes. Thanks, Do. We - we are doing it with our current sales force. I think I talked about the 33,000 prescribing base and I think we're seeing some encouraging results, right now in the CGRP class, you see about 7,000 new patients coming into the class and into the category that are receiving a CGRP therapy and it's our goal to broaden that given that there are so many patients, who are persisting on oral therapies and older therapies that are just not as effective and in fact we see very high drop off and very low persistency on these older oral meds like topiramate and we are trying to change that care continue on that pathway in the way physicians treat chronic migraine sufferers and I think we're having some success. So the 7,000-patient per week number that we're seeing is one that we're looking to grow and we are applying all the right efforts, both in our digital campaigns as well as our personal selling teams in the primary care community right now. So yes, the answer is, we have all the resources required to do that. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Yaron Werber from Cowen & Company. Yaron? Yaron Werber : If you don't mind, Dave, just have a quick housekeeping and then a question for Murdo. On the housekeeping side, Omecamtiv, can you just let us know is there one more final DSMB look before you look at the event rate, and then for Murdo just curious about Repatha, it looks like it's beginning to grow now. But now, what's your expectation given that 70% of patients that have access to the new price - the new formulation. Thank you. Dave Reese : Yes Yaron, so I'll take the Omecamtiv question. There is an -- as we've previously discussed, there is an interim analysis for efficacy that will occur, that has a very, very high bar, a very high bar in terms of the statistical stopping rule. So our expectation is that the trial will continue through to the primary analysis towards the end of the year. Murdo Gordon : Yes. And Yaron, on Repatha just a reminder, a 100% of patients are accessing the low-list price because we pulled the original list price off the market in December. And we've been able to throughout the course of 2019, open up the commercial access where the majority of patients receive Repatha by their physicians prescribing it without the need for paperwork and utilization management criteria, so physician attestation only in commercial is the majority condition for how they can prescribed Repatha. And then in Medicare Part D space, obviously that's a new event for us, because we were mid-cycle when we lowered the price with the introduction of the low list price. So it's really something we're excited about as an accelerating potential for Repatha, as was mentioned roughly 70% of Medicare Part D lives now have access to Repatha at an affordable co-pay. So we're looking forward to seeing sustained growth going forward. Our teams are ready and I was just with our sales forces in Dallas and everybody is pretty excited about being able to treat more patients quite frankly the way they should have been treated all along. Operator : And our next question is from line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Geoffrey. Geoffrey Porges : A quick housekeeping and then one for Murdo. First, could you just give us an update Dave on where the C5 biosimilar program is, is that still active and then for Murdo - Murdo, I'm impressed with the Evenity number, you're annualizing it sort of $350 million already, which I think is better than most of us anticipated. Could you talk a little bit about the reception you're receiving and whether you really think this can become Forteo's obviously losing its exclusivity, can it become a Forteo-like brand given what you're seeing already? Thanks. Dave Reese : Yes. Jeff, so I'll take the first part of that question relating to ABP 959 or Soliris biosimilar, the Phase 3 is actively enrolling and we'll provide guidance as we come to the conclusion of that trial when you can expect to see data. Murdo Gordon : Yes. And Geoffrey, thanks for the question on of Evenity. We are pleased with the launch trajectory on Evenity, it's reflective really of two markets, Japan and U.S. primarily. The Japanese launch has been nothing short of a resounding success out there with our partners, Astellas and UCB, I think physician reception has been excellent. We positioned the product for post-fracture high-risk patients and I think that that's gone really well and it's where the risk benefit equation seems to be one that most physicians are accepting off and we've done the same thing in the U.S., our launch is a little younger in the U.S., but nonetheless the trajectory has exceeded our own expectations as well. We just recently got our permanent J code in the U.S. and that's opening up the prescriber base as well. So I do think that we will have a very successful franchise on our hands and of course UCB will be commercializing with some help from us across Europe, thanks to the approval with the EMA there. So overall, whether - will it be as big as a Forteo that remains to be seen. We are - I will remind you slightly less expensive 30% on the low-end as much as 70% on the high end than our competitors in the category, it's a 12-month duration so it's not a product that you take for multiple years, it's for of 12-month duration, but the new patient acquisition is clearly exciting. Operator : And our next question is from line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Alethia? Alethia Young : I guess part of that has been another drug that's been doing quite well in spite of Sensipar. So maybe can you talk about should we expect continued kind of unit demand growth. I know you probably had some contracting obviously over the prior 12 months. But just maybe help us frame how to think about the next 12 months for parts of it. Thanks. Dave Reese : Yes, thanks, Alethia. The Parsabiv performance last year was fantastic. There are a number of patients, who are benefiting from it. There is a change in reimbursement for Parsabiv going into coming into 2020 that may slow the rate of growth a little, but the range of Parsabiv outcomes is broad and it's really too early to call. A \u2013 Bob Bradway : Okay, Ian, I think we've got two more calls we try to get them and then we'll wrap up. Operator : Very well. Our next question is from line of Salim Syed from Mizuho Securities. Salim? Salim Syed : Just one for me on Omecamtiv, David, you mentioned that the landscape will be changing believe on and some of the recent data. And I guess what I was looking for some clarity on when I presume you're talking about the SGLT2 space specifically flows in and then from the commentary you provide, are you envisioning this to be on the Omecamtiv to be on top of SGLT2s or competing at the head and if there is any patients actually getting enrolled in the trial. Thank you. Dave Reese : Yes, thanks Salim. Yes, so I was making reference to the SGLT2s in particular, our sense is that the patients treated in those studies were probably a somewhat less sick population. So that may be a point of differentiation and then as we have intended all along with our Omecamtiv given the lack of drug-drug interactions that we've seen now in the mechanism of action. It is intended to be an add-on to other therapies. Of course, in the Phase 3 trial, we will look at number of patients, who are receiving things such as SGLT2s in the study. Bob Bradway : Okay, let's get the last question. Operator : And our final question is from line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory? Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Gavin on for Cory. Thanks for fitting us in. I apologize if you answered this, but we are wondering what your assumptions are going into the double-digit growth for Otezla. Does this imply a label expansion or is this just with the existing label and or any comment on competitive concerns. A \u2013 Bob Bradway : And I think we've addressed that. But we just reiterate for you Gavin, what we think is behind that. A \u2013 Dave Reese : Yes. So we are assuming that we would secure additional indications in our assumption for double-digit going forward. We're also using historical growth rate and where we're sourcing a new patients right now. So I think that's pretty clear. Bob Bradway : Okay, everyone. Thanks for your patience. Sorry. We went a little bit past the allotted hour, but let me just conclude by saying that we feel good about where we ended in 2019 managing through what was always going to be a transition year for us, and we think we're on the cusp now of a period of new product revenue growth. So we look forward to that. And we look forward as well to important clinical data that is expected particularly towards the second half of this year. So I'd be remiss if I didn't just take a moment to thank as well the Amgen staff around the world, who continue to work so hard every day to deliver on our mission to serve patients. So thank you to them. And we look forward to let me chance to talk to all of you in April after the first quarter. Peter Griffith : Thanks Bob. Thanks everybody for your participation. If you have any other questions you would like to cover, of course myself, and the rest of the IR team will be around for several hours. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Amgen's fourth quarter 2019 financial results conference call. We thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : My name is Ian and I\u2019ll be you conference facilitator today for Amgen's First Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker\u2019s prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce, Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Okay. Thanks, Ian. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our Q1 call. I hope you and your families are staying safe. We are -- positioned with the COVID-19 pandemic. I know, I speak on behalf of all my colleagues at Amgen when I say that it's a source of great pride that we work in an industry that can be a part of the solution. Before we start, I would like to recognize those who are new in their coverage of Amgen, including Tim Anderson of Wolfe Research; Carter Gould of Barclays; and Michael Schmidt of Guggenheim. Welcome. Over the past few weeks I've talked with many of you and you have expressed concerns and pose questions about how this COVID pandemic will impact our business, including supply chain, clinical trials, commercial operations and growth outlook. As our growth outlook will be defined by how these variables unfold in the future, we have modified the order of presenters today, so you can get a good sense of how we are dealing with the uncertainties and remedial actions we are taking to run our business effectively. Our CEO, Bob Bradway will commence the call with some opening comments; followed by our Head of R&D, Dave Reese who will provide a pipeline update; our Head of Commercial Operations, Murdo Gordon will give you a state of the business; and then our CFO, Peter Griffith will bring it all together by helping you understand what all this means in terms of our growth outlook. By the way consistent with the recommendations for social distancing, we are all in different locations today. So please bear with us as we are doing the best we can. Just a quick reminder that we'll use non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. I would direct you to our 10-K and subsequent filings, which identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to acknowledge upfront that this has been an extraordinary quarter for all of us. Global pandemic, economic disruption like none of us have seen before, and of course financial volatility that has been dizzying at times. But I hope you're keeping well and we're certainly grateful to you for joining the call -- results we're managing through the COVID disruption quite well and feel we're operating from a position of strength with a healthy balance sheet, a strong portfolio of products and an organization that has proven itself time and again to be innovative, resilient and able to adapt quickly to changing circumstances. I want to take a few moments to share how we've been responding to COVID-19 and then we can dive into the details of the first quarter and what we see for the remainder of the year. We've mobilized our company around four priorities. First, taking care of our staff, our 23,000 staff around the world; second, continuing to serve patients with an uninterrupted supply of our commercial and clinical medicines; third, leveraging our core genetics immunology and antibody expertise in the fight against COVID-19; and finally, supporting the communities where we live and work. Our first priority from the beginning of the pandemic has been to ensure the safety of our people and their families. To encourage social distancing, Amgen staff worldwide are mostly working from home now. We're encouraged that in a few markets, conditions have improved to the point where we've begun returning our people to the workplace and we hope to expand our back to the workplace activities in the coming -- I would also note that about a quarter of our staff are engaged in essential manufacturing and R&D activities that have required them to continue coming to the workplace every day. We're taking every possible measure to keep these employees safe and we're grateful to them for their commitments to patients into our business. All our staff are performing really well as you can see from our results. At a time when health care systems around the world are being stretched to their limits, we're committed to working collaboratively with our partners in the health care ecosystem. We need to make sure that we're both responding to COVID-19 and meeting the ongoing needs of other seriously ill patients -- health care crisis that we as a society never intended. From a supply chain perspective, we've not experienced any significant disruptions and we don't currently anticipate any shortages of our medicines due to COVID-19. With respect to clinical trials, our pivotal studies including for AMG 510, Otezla, tezepelumab and omecamtiv mecarbil are fully enrolled and expected to read out this year as previously announced. Other programs such as our BiTEs in oncology have also continued to progress and we're encouraged by the accumulating data there. Where programs have been interrupted by the COVID pandemic, we're busy making plans to get them restarted as soon as appropriate from a patient safety and regulatory perspective. By now, it's clear that overcoming this pandemic will require innovative science. While the virus may have gotten the jump on us at the outset, the good news is that the community of innovative biopharmaceutical companies is moving at a speed and scale never seen before and we're gaining ground on the virus with each passing day. While our research does not include antivirals, we have a role to play in this battle leveraging our genetics, immunology and antibody expertise to do so. As previously announced, we're harnessing the molecular epidemiology work done by our deCODE subsidiary and working with our partners at Adaptive Biotechnologies to develop an antibody to prevent or treat COVID-19. If we're successful, our industry-leading manufacturing capabilities will play an important role in helping us meet the needs of patients. In addition, based on its mechanism of action, Otezla might help prevent the respiratory distress seen in late-stage COVID patients. As Dave Reese will explain in a moment, we'll be exploring this question in clinical trials imminently. And we've long prioritized being a good citizen within the health care ecosystem and within the communities where we live and work -- by COVID-19 has been devastating for many. While we certainly have been impacted by the pandemic at Amgen, we recognize that we're in a fortunate position and we're committed to doing our part to help during this time of need. Toward that end, the Amgen Foundation is supporting COVID-19 in a variety of ways with a focus on communities where we have a significant presence. To give you just one example, we donated testing equipment in Ventura County, our home county that effectively has doubled the testing capacity for COVID-19 here. Looking forward, we're confident in the future. We were in a strong position heading into the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect to stay strong as we come through the other side of this. We remain focused on delivering sustained long-term growth and we're confident in our outlook for that. As I've already noted, we have a number of important innovative medicines advancing our pipeline and the key programs remain on track from a timing perspective. Our integration of Otezla has been seamless. In Japan, we have now successfully completed the integration of our Astellas partnership. And we're already well advanced and collaborating effectively with our colleagues at Beijing and China. All this gives me confidence that we're executing effectively around the world despite the challenges of COVID-19. Finally, -- a fact that will enable us to continue our capital allocation principles, which to remind you are to invest in innovation internally and externally while returning significant capital to our shareholders. Though the pandemic is still very fluid and to be sure the first few weeks of April have clearly shown some signs of disruption, the combination of our results from the first quarter and our expectation of an improving outlook for global health care activity give us confidence that the guidance we provided earlier in the year still incorporates the likely range of outcomes for our business in 2020. Peter will give you more color on this shortly. Amgen's strength has always come from its people. Like me they believe in the power of science to make a difference in the world. We often talk about this being the biocentury, the golden age of innovation for biology. We may have met our challenge of the century in SARS-COVID-2, but I hope however bleak this pandemic may seem at times, that all of you share our optimism, this virus will ultimately yield to the relentless efforts of the biopharmaceutical industry, we're rustle it to ground. I'm proud of the team at Amgen for coming together to support each other and all those we serve during such a challenging time. I'm proud also of the work we are doing with our industry colleagues to tackle the COVID-19 challenge. With that, let me turn over to Dave Reese, who will provide a pipeline update. Dave? Dave Reese : Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. In light of the evolving COVID-19 epidemic, the structure of today's R&D update will differ from my usual approach. Some of the first quarter highlights can be found within our press release and accompanying presentation and, of course, I'll be happy to address questions on any other aspects of our pipeline following our general comments. I don't have to tell you that we're in the midst of the biggest public health crisis of our lifetimes, which presents unprecedented challenges in patient care and clinical development. Therefore, today my comments will focus primarily on our R&D operations and clinical trial execution in the current environment, where our first principle is to ensure the safety and well-being of patients and health care providers taking part in our clinical trials. With respect to key late-stage trials that are scheduled to read out this year, we have been working closely with our collaborators at AstraZeneca and Cytokinetics on the execution of our pivotal studies for tezepelumab and omecamtiv mecarbil respectively, both of which have completed enrollment. We currently do not expect any significant delays and continue to expect completion of these studies this year. We believe we will have high-quality data from both of these trials. This is also the case with our potentially pivotal Phase II monotherapy study for AMG 510, now known as sotorasib in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, which is also fully enrolled. As I mentioned last quarter, we will be collecting at least six months of response data in these patients and continue to expect these results later this year. I would note that the Phase III trial of Otezla in mild to moderate psoriasis also remains on track and we expect data from that study in the coming weeks. As previously disclosed, we have temporarily paused enrollment in clinical trials, where there is uncertainty around the ability of sites to ensure subject safety or data integrity. Patients already enrolled in our studies continue to receive study drug and we remain focused on supporting our clinical investigators to ensure appropriate care of these patients in a safe manner consistent with clinical site and agency guidelines. We're actively working with regulators and implemented study procedures as appropriate that are consistent with the recent FDA guidelines, including remote monitoring, virtual follow-up, alternative locations for assessment and home delivery of investigational product. We continue to make decisions study-by-study and site-by-site to minimize risk to the patients and facilities and to maintain trial integrity. For example, enrollment continues in certain studies where there is the potential for a significant benefit in a serious life-threatening conditions and where site resources allow new patients to be safely enrolled and closely monitored. Such trials include, but certainly not limited to our HL -- half-life extended BiTE programs targeting BCMA and to L3 and PSMA and we look forward to sharing data from these studies later this year. In other studies such as our sotorasib Phase I combination study with Keytruda and the Phase III confirmatory study where we have paused enrollment to ensure patient safety, time lines may be impacted and I'll provide updates as the situation develops and we gain more clarity. There is ongoing interest from investigators to provide their patients' access to investigational therapies, with potential for significant benefit and we are working to continue to study start-up activities for sotorasib and across our entire portfolio to allow rapid site activation. We look forward to resuming enrollment in pod studies and initiating subject to enrollment in new studies over the coming weeks and months, as soon as it is safe and feasible to do so. As we look forward to this year's clinical study readouts, we will be working with representatives of medical conferences and journals to ensure continued dissemination of important data to the medical community in a peer-reviewed environment, as we anticipate that many congresses will be virtual through the end of 2020. In any case, we have provided -- we are committed to providing data updates in a timely manner. We're also continuing to prioritize programs across our preclinical and clinical portfolios as you might expect. For instance based on the progress of our half-life extended BiTE molecules, we have stopped development of the first generation continuous infusion PSMA and BCMA BiTE programs. In research essential work has continued and we are begging to ramp laboratory activities across the organization as the situation facedly permit in various geographies. I\u2019m also please to report that our BeiGene collaboration is on track, and this quarter we began to transition certain functional activities to BeiGene including non-promotional activities through in-line products and some local regulatory responsibilities in China. I\u2019d like to close by saying the few words about how we\u2019re leveraging our expertise and therapeutic antibody development and immunology in the fight against COVID-19. Our recently announced collaboration with Adaptive Biotechnologies to identifying neutralizing antibodies to the coronavirus from the public COVID-19 patient is now actively under way. We view Adaptive as a world-class expertise in the mean profiling, combined with Amgen expertise in immunology and antibody engineering and manufacturing as a unique opportunity to contribute to what an unprecedented industry response to this pandemic. We are working intently to identify the highest quality therapeutic candidates as fast as we can and we'll take advantage of frequent interactions offered by regulatory authorities. In our view, there will likely be more than one generation of antibody therapeutics and our aim is to develop the highest possible quality candidates. In addition to our efforts to develop a therapeutic antibody, we have also been engaged in discussions with multiple groups conducting platform trials in COVID-19 and anticipate that Otezla will enter the clinic in the coming weeks to be investigated as a potential immunomodulatory treatment in adult patients with the disease. Finally, we are contributing actively to collaborative efforts to advance therapeutics for COVID-19, including ACTIV, the public-private partnership with the NIH. I want to close by acknowledging our staff, are working tirelessly and selflessly under these challenging circumstances to deliver for our patients. Their commitment and execution have been exemplary and I can't thank them enough. I'd now like to turn things over to Murdo Gordon. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. We started the year with strong volume-driven growth of 15% on a global basis with 10% in the U.S. and 32% ex-U.S. Growth was generated broadly across our portfolio of newer products more than offsetting declines in our mature brands. Given the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, I want to start by sharing our views on how disruptions in the global health care system may impact our business, and then I'll walk through what we're seeing at the product level and what actions we are taking. Like others in our sector, we're seeing varying degrees of impact from COVID-19 across our portfolio as physician-patient interactions are interrupted. These reduced interactions have led to some delays in diagnosis and treatment, which in turn reduces new patient starts. Data from IQVIA suggests that patient office visits have declined by over 50%, although some of this is being offset by telemedicine and telehealth services. Data also show that some patients refilled prescriptions early and that there was a modest benefit of approximately $100 million from inventory in the quarter. Finally, increased utilization of patient affordability programs and changes in segment mix due to increased U.S. unemployment could negatively impact U.S. net prices. Treatments like Prolia that require in office administration by a health care provider have been negatively impacted. On the other hand, the product like Otezla may benefit given that it provides a convenient oral option for patients compared with injectable or IV biologics, some of which require monitoring. Despite this disruption, our teams are responding to customer needs via remote interactions. We're identifying innovative solutions to help patients and we're supplying products reliably and consistently. Now let me review some product details beginning with Prolia on Slide 12. Prolia grew 10% year-over-year from higher volume. Strong demand growth in January and February was consistent with prior years. In March, we began to see a negative impact on Prolia in office injections and have since observed a substantial step down in utilization versus prior years. In more recent weeks, we're beginning to see signs of stabilization and we'll be able to provide more clarity on this when we report our Q2 results in July. The importance of treating osteoporosis in patients who are at high-risk of fractures is critical. Our teams are working to address continuity of care issues and exploring novel solutions such as alternate sites of care, mobile nurse-administered injections, prescription fills at specialty and retail pharmacies. We're also working with policymakers and advocacy organizations to address treatment challenges in this environment. Moving to Evenity, which launched in Japan and the U.S. in the first half of 2019. Evenity posted $100 million in sales during the first quarter, driven by continued uptick. In Japan, which represents roughly two-thirds of Evenity sales, we've attained shares similar to those established anabolic therapies. In the U.S., we saw an acceleration in demand trends with improvements in persistence in Q1 as clinics gained more experience. As patients complete their one year cycle of therapy with Evenity, we will work with healthcare providers to help transition these patients to Prolia. Evenity and Prolia are a complementary set of options to address the 9 million fractures that occur worldwide in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients and our teams are focused on ensuring these patients are not compromised during this pandemic. Moving to Repatha. We're off to a strong start in 2020. Our efforts over the past 18 months to improve access and affordability have yielded strong results as Q1 sales grew by 62% year-over-year, driven by 98% volume growth versus the same period last year. New-to-brand prescriptions in the U.S. steadily improved in Q1, growing 51% year-over-year and we held 80% market share exiting the quarter. As we appreciate in our last earnings call, Part D contracting to improve access and affordability resulted in a step down in Repatha's net selling price in Q1. We expect net selling price to be relatively stable for the remainder of the year. On to Aimovig on Slide 15. On a year-over-year basis, net sales grew 20% with underlying volume growth of 46%. Aimovig remains the market leader with 48% total prescription share. To date, almost 330,000 patients have been prescribed Aimovig by more than 33,000 prescribers. With the recent addition to CVS National Preferred Formulary, we now have access to 93% of covered lives, which led to a 19% growth quarter-over-quarter in new-to-brand prescriptions. Net price was sequentially lower due to expanded access with CVS and higher co-pay utilization that occurs each year in the first quarter. These factors were partially offset by the proportion of paid prescriptions increasing to almost 90%, up from 81% in Q4 of 2019. Next to our inflammation portfolio starting with Otezla. Integration has been seamless evidenced by 23% year-over-year growth driven by volume. These results coupled with planned label expansion give us confidence in our ability to realize the full global potential of Otezla, as an affordable option with a very well-defined efficacy and safety profile. In the current COVID environment Otezla provides a convenient oral option for patients. It's conducive to telemedicine and does not require lab monitoring. Moving to Enbrel. Sales were $1.2 billion in Q1 and included a $70 million year-over-year benefit from favorable changes in accounting estimates related to sales deductions. Consistent with prior trends, prescription volumes declined 5% year-over-year. We continue to expect a limited benefit from net selling price in 2020 versus 2019. In this environment, we're supporting Enbrel's strong continuing base of patients in maintaining their course of therapy through disruptions and out-of-pocket cost barriers. As you know, Enbrel has been on the market for over 20 years and does not require routine lab monitoring. Now to slide 18. Another contributor to our inflammation franchise is Amgevita, which for three consecutive quarters as the number one adalimumab Biosimilar in Europe recording $86 million of sales in Q1. Switching to our hematology and oncology business, our innovative portfolio of six brands collectively totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter growing by 11% year-over-year. Certain products like XGEVA may be impacted in the current environment due to disruptions in physician-patient interactions. Although others including Neulasta Onpro and our oncology biosimilars MVASI and KANJINTI provide greater value. Let me highlight some of our larger products. KYPROLIS grew 14% year-over-year led by a 21% increase in U.S. sales, which was driven by expanded use in second and third-line multiple myeloma. Neulasta declined 40% year-over-year recall that Q1 of 2019 benefited from a $98 million BARDA order, which did not repeat this quarter. OnPro continues to be the preferred choice and has held quarter-over-quarter share at 54% despite facing an additional competitor. The revised NCCN guidelines recommend increased use of G-CSFs to minimize the risk of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients. Onpro provides a unique value proposition, particularly, now as patients can receive their G-CSF treatment without having to return to their site of care. Our two oncology biosimilars MVASI and KANJINTI generated $234 million in sales globally in the first quarter. In the U.S., they sold $108 million and $96 million respectively with market shares exiting Q1 at or above 27%. We continue to see encouraging adoption rates in clinics with hospital adoption accelerating. These biosimilars are increasingly valuable given the cost savings that they provide. Switching to nephrology, starting on slide 24. Given the serious nature of end-stage renal disease patients require dialysis treatments three days per week. Therefore, we're not seeing a meaningful impact on the use of Amgen medications in these patients that would attribute to COVID-19. In Q1 EPOGEN sales declined 29% primarily due to lower net selling price from our contractual commitment with DaVita and approximately $20 million of unfavorable changes in accounting estimates. Sensipar sales declined 42% year-over-year due to the impact of generic competition. As a reminder, supplemental patent protection certificates for cinacalcet have now expired in major EU markets, which could result in a significant decline in ex-U.S. sales in 2020. Parsabiv grew by 39% year-over-year in the first quarter. Independent and midsize dialysis providers already utilize Parsabiv for a majority of their calcimimetic patients. While FMC and DaVita continue to increase adoption. In summary, I'm truly inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit of our employees who are helping patients and health care providers in this unprecedented time. And with that I'd like to turn over to Peter. Peter Griffith : Thank you, Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing our results and guidance, I would like to take a moment to build on Bob's comments regarding the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and provide additional insights into how we are responding to and navigating through the associated macroeconomic challenges. First, we confront these challenges from a position of strength. Our fundamentals are strong with over $8 billion of cash and investments and a business that generated $2 billion of free cash flow in the first quarter we are in a strong financial -- remain committed to our capital allocation principles shown on slide 28, which start with investing in internal innovation. We will patiently evaluate external business development opportunities that clear our hurdle rate and are consistent with our areas of therapeutic focus. Our capital expenditures remain a high priority including our industry-leading environmentally friendly next-generation biomanufacturing facility in Rhode Island. We will continue to return capital to our shareholders. Our capital allocation principles will continue to build on our efficient capital structure which results in an optimal weighted average cost of capital. Now I will briefly walk through our first quarter financial results before discussing our 2020 guidance. The financial results are shown on Slide 29 of the slide deck. The first quarter marked another period of solid performance as we grew volumes 15% increased investments in the business and delivered 17% year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth. Q1 revenues at $6.2 billion increased 11% year-over-year. In the quarter we saw worldwide product sales increased 12% to $5.9 billion as our portfolio transitioned with strong growth from our newer products outpacing declines in our mature products. Now on to the rest of the P&L. Total operating expense for the quarter increased 7% year-over-year. For the full year, we now expect total operating expenses to grow in the high single-digit percentage range year-over-year on an absolute basis. On a non-GAAP basis cost of sales as a percent of product sales decreased by 1.6 percentage points to 13.1%, driven primarily by lower manufacturing costs partially offset by an increase in milestone expense. For the full year we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be generally consistent with 2019. Research and development expenses of $927 million were 8% higher due to higher spending on Otezla and AMG 510, partially offset by cost recoveries from our collaboration with BeiGene. For the full year we also expect R&D spend on an absolute basis to increase as we invest in our innovative pipeline and new Otezla indications. With these increases partially offset by R&D recoveries received from our BeiGene collaboration. SG&A expenses increased 12% -- Otezla. And for the full year we continue to expect SG&A spend to increase primarily due to Otezla spend. Our Q1 non-GAAP operating income at $3.2 billion increased 15% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 53.9% for the quarter compared to 52.4% in Q1 of 2019. Other income and expenses were a net $335 million expense in Q1. This is unfavorable by $177 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year change was due to lower interest income on cash balances, as well as market fluctuations of publicly traded securities held in our venture portfolio. We anticipate non-GAAP other income and expense to be a net expense toward the upper end of the $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion range, we previously provided. Recall that we will begin recording under the equity method of accounting our share of BeiGene's profit or loss beginning in Q2. The non-GAAP tax rate decreased 1.8 percentage points versus Q1, 2019 to 12.8%. Non-GAAP net income was $2.5 million -- a 17% year-over-year for the first quarter supported by a 5% reduction in share count versus Q1 2019. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 30, during Q1 2020, we generated strong cash flow reflecting a diversified portfolio of products coupled with an industry-leading cost structure. Free cash flow was $2.0 billion in Q1, 2020 versus $1.7 billion in Q1 2019. In Q1 2020, we returned a total of $1.9 billion to shareholders through dividend payments totaling over $900 million and over $900 million to repurchase 4.3 million shares at an average price of $219 per share. For the remainder of the year, we plan to maintain our quarterly dividend of $1.60 per share, and we'll execute opportunistic share repurchases that will result in an amount at the lower end of our previous guidance of $3 billion to $5 billion for 2020. Cash and investments totaled $8 billion at the end of Q1 2020, a decrease of $18.3 billion from the end of Q1 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by the Otezla and BeiGene transactions, cash returned to shareholders in the form of share repurchases -- as well as net debt repayments, partially offset by free cash flow generated during the period. Additionally, I note in Q2 2020, we plan to make $1.75 billion payment in debt payment, debt maturity payments. We issued $5 billion of long-term debt in February in order to take advantage of market conditions for refinancing our long-term debt maturities in 2020 and partially those in 2021. We will continue to be opportunistic with strong access to capital markets. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter totaled $31.8 billion, and carries a weighted average interest rate of 3.7 -- years. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2020 starting on slide 31. Our guidance provided in January contemplated a broad range of outcomes. Due to the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 impact, we expect some degree of uncertainty in quarterly revenue and earnings over the year. We currently expect that we will see the greatest impact later in Q2 with stabilization and then partial recovery occurring during the second half of the year. And now turning to slide 32, we are reaffirming our guidance with a revenue range of $25.0 billion to $25.6 billion and a non-GAAP EPS range of $14.85 to $15.6. We will be monitoring the business as the dynamics underlying these assumptions evolve across Q2 and we'll review our latest perspectives with you at our next earnings call. We are now guiding to capital expenditures of $600 million versus our prior guidance of $700 million, reflecting a change in the timing of spend, rather than a change to our investment plans. Additionally, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 13.5% to 14.5% for the full year. This concludes the financial update. I've been with Amgen, a little over six months, and it's the privilege to serve patients every day here by supporting and enabling the Amgen difference. And each day during this COVID-19 disruption, I'm reminded that innovation is the miracle drug. With that, I'll turn it back over to Bob for some closing remarks. Bob Bradway : Well, before my closing remarks, we'll go to Q&A. So let's have Ian, let's open it up for Q&A, remind our callers of the process that we'll follow. Thanks. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Jay, your line is open. Jay Olson : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. And thank you for the work that you're doing to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. I wanted to ask about the non-GAAP operating margin. It ticked up nicely in the first quarter. And I noticed that, you lowered the OpEx expected growth rate slightly. So, I was wondering, how do you expect the operating margin to evolve over the course of 2020? And do you expect that higher operating margin to be sustainable in a post COVID-19 world? Thank you. Peter Griffith : Jay, thank you for the question, it\u2019s a good. As I indicated, we do project that for the full year, our total OpEx will grow in the high single-digit percentage range. We are confident in our cost structure and our productivity work here at Amgen. So I think our operating margin speaks for itself and we expect it to be an industry-leading cost margin going forward in 2020. And of course, we don't give any guidance beyond 2020 on the margin. Bob Bradway : Just to state the obvious Jay we would have liked to have spent more in Q1 but we were getting a little bit disrupted there as you know at the end of the quarter. So we'll see what it's like for the remaining three quarters of the year. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is open. Tim Anderson : Thank you very much. My question is something that's probably a thorn in your side which is the ongoing Enbrel patent challenge and that's one of the bigger events for the company in 2020 the appeals court ruling. And I'm sure you're confident in your positioning on how that will play out. But these things are never certain. So, I'm wondering if you can just help us describe what Plan B would be in the event that Sandoz actually prevails as your largest product I'm guessing you had some sort of contingency plan in place. I know it's a low probability event, but any perspective would be helpful? Dave Reese : Tim, we're not going to go into details on that. Obviously, we continue to feel confident in the intellectual property around Enbrel. So, let's leave it at that for now. Thanks. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Chris, your line is open. Chris Raymond : Hey thanks. So, I know you guys have talked about the collaboration with Adaptive in your antibody program. But just -- there are a lot of folks I think that are working on similar sort of purpose-built products Regeneron and peer and others. I wonder if you could give a little bit more color on what differentiates what you guys are doing. And maybe also a little more color on time lines in terms of being in the clinic et cetera? Thanks. Dave Reese : Thanks Chris, Dave Reese here. I'll take that question. Yes. So, as you know there are a number of efforts going forward to develop therapeutic antibodies. And what we're trying to do I think that is potentially unique here is number one combine Adaptive's capabilities in immuno-profiling with our immunology and particularly our genetics work based out of deCODE. Our goal also is to really identify a very high-quality therapeutic candidate and it's my belief that there may well be more than one generation of antibody therapeutics entering the clinic. So, as we think about this we want to balance speed of development which of course is important with generating the highest quality candidate. And as work progresses we are up and running in the laboratory but we will provide guidance as -- in terms of clinical timelines as that work unfolds. But that collaboration is actively proceeding right now. Bob Bradway : Chris maybe I could just add a comment about manufacturing. Obviously, -- a lot of protein. We have great expertise in manufacturing at scale. And we think one of the things we can bring to the party here is our ability to supply a vast number of patients with our antibody. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff your line is open. Geoff Meacham : Afternoon guys. Thanks for the question. I guess one for Bob. When you had the first full quarter of Otezla in the mix and now it looks like you have a pretty competitive growth profile in the industry from a top and bottom-line perspective? So, I know that's obviously fully expected but does either the growth acceleration or the volatility from COVID effect, your attitude towards BD, I'm just thinking about maybe a step-up in the number of deals or maybe increasing appetite for larger ones in this environment? Thank you. Dave Reese : I think the environment is pretty fluid still Geoff. So, I wouldn't try to -- I'm not sure I'd like to declare an answer to your question at the moment. But other than to reiterate that -- and we think we're in a strong position. We've talked about our balance sheet we talked about our desire to allocate capital to our internal innovation as well as the external innovation. And as you know we're pretty focused on our strategy and we'll look to see whether there are things externally that can help us strengthen our chosen areas. But maybe the other thing I would add just as a way to reiterate my appreciation of my Amgen colleagues is we had three very significant and successful integrations in the first quarter. So, it was a priority for us as a company to get off to a good start with Otezla and with BeiGene and with our Japan transaction and we really feel we've done that over the first four months of the year. So, I feel good about that. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael, your line is open. Michael Yee : Thank you for the question. And congrats on all the progress and appreciate the color during this tough time. My question was for David. On AMG 510 of course you didn't mention you have an updated at ASCO. Can you just remind us how to think about colorectal cancer as a monotherapy? I guess what was new there? And then excluding lung and colorectal there's an update there. Can you just remind us what would be the relevance there? And then the timing on the combos which is -- which are not at ASCO what to think about there and timing? I appreciate the update. Dave Reese : Thanks, Michael. Yes. A series of questions regarding AMG 510, we're continuing to enroll monotherapy patients with colorectal cancer. And as I've indicated before, we're going to look at those data, I would say, over the coming few months to determine whether we feel there's an appropriate monotherapy path forward in colorectal cancer or whether combination therapy is most appropriate. With respect to other non-lung cancer, non-colorectal cancer indications, we are -- there are other malignancies such as a small percentage of pancreatic cancer, appendiceal cancer and endometrial cancer and we will be able to provide updates on ASCO on some of those tumors and response data. And then finally in terms of the combination therapy trial these are some of the trials that we -- some of them we paused because they were either just initiating or had just initiated. We're getting ready to ramp back up. So I would expect first data with the earliest later this year perhaps the very first part of next year on those. But we're confident that we're not experiencing significant disruptions across the program in totality and we're happy -- we're quite happy actually with its progress. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence, your line is open. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a follow-up for me on AMG 510. I know you guys have guided to the Phase 2 lung cancer data in the middle part of this year. Just wondering now as we're closer to the data if you could share any perspective on what you view as kind of the efficacy bar here? Is Cyramza the right bar? Or should we think about higher efficacy here given it's a targeted drug? Thank you. Dave Reese : Thanks Terence. This is Dave. Yes. In terms of the timing of the date, I'd point out that what we've indicated is that we want at least six months of response data on all patients. And given that the last patients were enrolled towards the end of the last year that it takes a month or two typically for responses to develop. You can see that that pushes it into the second half of the year in terms of when we expect the data readout. We're absolutely on track and we're not experiencing any I would say substantial hiccups in the Phase 2 monotherapy study. We do want robust duration of response and progression-free survival data as part of that package. And I think those endpoints along with response rate to address the second part of your question will be an important part of the package in this Phase 2 monotherapy study. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Yaron Werber with Cowen. Yaron, your line is open. Yaron Werber : Great. Thanks for taking my question as well. I have an AMG 510 question as well. The Phase 3, David the study obviously is fairly sizable. It's 650 patients head-to-head against docetaxel. And I think it kind of drew some questions as to why was that docetaxel really used as the control and not Cyramza in combo? And maybe give us a little bit of sense why is this study so sizable? Is it -- should we read into your expectation on OR? Or is it really about trying to powered for survival? Thank you. Dave Reese : Yes. Thanks Yaron for the question. In terms of the comparator arm this was -- this choice was based on what remains -- one of the standards of care docetaxel around the world the discussions with regulatory authorities and investigators and we feel that that's an appropriate comparator here. The sample size calculations were driven by the desire to be able to robustly test for overall survival. And so the second part of your statement there is correct. If this was powered on overall survival. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew, your line is open. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask a question around stocking dynamics for the quarter. I know you called out a couple of one-time items and what you thought was the benefit from COVID. Could you maybe just put that in context? Obviously, normally in the first quarter you see a lot of destocking across the product lines, did you not see that typical destocking? And so could that be also a potential benefit that's going to come out through the year? Maybe you could just comment on that? Thanks. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Hi, Matthew, it's Murdo. Yes, as I mentioned, we saw about $100 million of stocking inventory build I should say in the first quarter which happened across markets. The only other element that I would maybe compare in contrast to some other companies that are reporting, our business given that it's predominantly specialty biologics, I know a fair amount of physician administration products didn't necessarily have the same extent of early prescription fills and patient 90-day fills, that would have been an additional pull forward for some other companies. As they reported they blended that dynamic with end customer and wholesale inventory build. So the $100 million refers to end customer and wholesaler inventory, specifically. On products like Otezla, we may have had some pull forward from some early fills and maybe 90-day scripts. And we'll just have to wait and see how that works through in Q2. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with SunTrust Robinson. Robyn, your line is open. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi, guys. Thank you so much and great work on running the business in this time. So can I take a broader step back question? I know we've been focused on a lot of specific questions. You guys have had a lot of experience then this financial crisis and people switching from a commercial payer to a Medicare or government payer. Help us think about how you managed that? How you get people quickly to switch? And how you manage the impact of that? And then secondly for telemedicine, how comfortable are prescribers writing to Evenity? And how do you think that telemedicine really impacts your business? I know that's a new one for you? Thank you. Bob Bradway : Robyn before Murdo answers, let me make sure we heard that you said how comfortable are we writing or are doctors writing? Did you say Evenity prescriptions in telemedicine? Robyn Karnauskas : Yes. Yes. Like telemedicine aspect is new for all of us. We're trying to understand how that will impact businesses. And obviously you have many products that could be prescribed of telemedicine. So those are two aspects it would be great. Murdo Gordon : Right. Yes Robyn, if I could just clarify further on the first part of your question, is your question related to opening up government access like we've done over the last little while? Or is it the transition of people potentially from commercial to a government benefit because of COVID-19? Robyn Karnauskas : It's really transition. So what a lot of people are asking is what -- if we transition given a potential a lot of people at work they're going to transition to a government-based plan, you've been through this before. So you're one of the few companies that can probably tell us how you manage that? And how you'll run the business and you think the impact might be? Murdo Gordon : Okay. No that's helpful. Thanks for the clarification. So let's start with that topic. On the -- first off, our overall Medicaid portion of our business right now is quite low. It's less than 10% of our total revenue. And the majority of our products beyond that are reimbursed through Medicare Part B and D with or about 50% of our total business being reimbursed through commercial. So it's that commercial piece as you rightly point out that is likely or a portion of that is likely to transition to a government channel. Now the thing that's harder to predict is at what rate? So as people who become unemployed and an important distinction is furloughed, they retain benefits for a period of time if they opt into Cobra and furloughed employees are often still on their self-insured company employee plan sponsored plan. So there's a time lag that's going to occur before people transition to either a state exchange or a Medicaid benefit. So I think the impact could be a delayed one, more like towards the end of this year and into 2021. And of course, trying to pin down the actual numbers of Americans that are going to end up in an unemployment benefits is hard to peg right now. So those are the two things. It's the total bolus and the rate of change. I've heard some commentary and read some things that would appear to indicate people expect it earlier. Our perspective is that some of these patients and people will transition over time and it will more likely be a delay to an effect into 2021. On telemedicine, I would just say that there's a variety of maturity of high telemedicine is used by therapeutic area. If you think about mental health and I would argue even in neurology, telemedicine is already used quite extensively even pre-COVID. And I would say that the uptake for telemedicine and evaluating someone like a migraine patient is going to be relatively straightforward as it would be perhaps for a dermatology patient. So in the case of neurology, migraine would be Aimovig and then for dermatology it would be Otezla. You mentioned Evenity, of course Evenity is primarily prescribed post fracture, so patients are likely to be in a clinic or a hospital setting. And so the ability for the physician to evaluate the patient and prescribe Evenity is probably pretty straightforward related to that acute event. But we're watching it closely. We actually -- because of Aimovig and other brands that -- where telemedicine was already being used fairly extensively, we had some experience here that goes back over a year and we've been scaling our experience there now. So I think Amgen will be on the front foot when it comes to building out our capabilities in that area. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny, your line is open. Ronny Gal : Hi. Good evening. And let me add my thanks to Dave and for all the work you're doing on COVID-19. Two, if I may. First for David, the PD-1 and you expanded that work a couple of times you started about 40 patients now you have about 270 patients. What -- given that you're originally a little bit skeptical at Amgen about PD-1, is this just looking for ways to leverage the same protocol to do more? And what does that mean about your ability to bring that product to market and timing? And then to Murdo, you've done fabulously well with about -- as I -- by my count you did about $320 million this quarter. Now, we have Pfizer coming in the United States, they've taken a bit more extra price decreases what is that -- what's your expectation for the rest of the year? And if you can also mention what you guys are doing with your REMICADE biosimilar kind of an interesting product? Dave Reese : Well thanks, Ronnie. This is Dave. I'll start with the PD-1 question for AMG 404. We continue to develop AMG 404 primarily as a combination partner for our pipeline agents. This is a Phase I umbrella study and we added cohorts to study additional indications where the tumors in question have well described PD-1 sensitivity that will limit the need we hope for single-arm data in future trials and ultimately we think we'll probably need on the order of 200 give or take monotherapy patients to support the standard safety package for AMG 404. So all of that put together expansion of the Phase I trial allowed us an efficient way to generate appropriate data. Murdo Gordon : Yes. And when it comes to our biosimilars business, we are pleased with the run rate of over $300 million in the quarter. I would say -- I would attribute our success first and foremost to Amgen's reputation as a high-quality biologics manufacturer. I think that is something that differentiates us and is perceived well by our customers. Our experience in Europe was a very positive one. We applied those lessons learned to our U.S. launches of the two oncology biosimilars. And I think it shows you that the biosimilars market is functioning well in the United States. I would also say that the biosimilar business model for Amgen is very much integrated with our innovative products. So the same people who are defending Neulasta, the same account managers who are defending Neulasta day-in day-out and making sure that the benefit of Onpro is understood by our customers are the same people who are establishing the uptake curve for MVASI and KANJINTI. So those account relationships that we've cultivated over many, many years in oncology have been extremely valuable. And our relationships at the payer-provider level, I think have helped us extend that trajectory nicely. I would also say that our patient services are exemplary and we have the very same patient services that we have for a product like KYPROLIS or XGEVA we apply to our biosimilars business as well. And then you mentioned, I think Avsola, which is our Remicade biosimilar. We do intend to launch that this year. And that product will help strengthen what is already a strong immunotherapy portfolio for us and will help us broaden out that customer perspective. And again that product will be integrated with our innovative autoimmune portfolio. Bob Bradway : Ian, let's take the next question. And it's getting -- and as it's getting late on the East Coast, if I can just ask everybody to please limit yourself to one question. Ian, let's go on with the next one. Operator : Certainly. Our next one is from the line of Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse. Evan, your line is open. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. And, kind of, a follow-up from what you were just talking about Murdo. So how has the pandemic impact of the uptick of biosimilars? Have you seen an acceleration in adoption to save cost? Or if centers really delayed uptake given potentially overwhelmed systems? Thank you. Murdo Gordon : So it's a bit early to tell. So take my comments with a very few weeks of experience here. I would say so far we have not seen a negative effect on our uptake. If anything we're seeing a steepening of our uptake curve. The one thing I will say that we haven't yet assessed that could happen is the total cycles of bevacizumab, or the total cycles of trastuzumab could be impacted. So from a share of molecule perspective, we're very pleased what we're watching is the total number of infusions of each of the molecules going forward. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Dane Leone with Raymond James. Dane? Dane Leone : Hi. Thank you for taking the questions and the update. I just want to ask a business development question and I'll just keep it to one here. When you're thinking about ramping up your efforts of KRAS, obviously, the initial data set is great for how you're thinking about the target oncology space. Thinking about that and then also thinking about the bolt-on with the Otezla that you did to start broadening out how you think about immunology, where do you want to go in those respective areas from a biz dev perspective? I mean, there's a lot of room you guys still have to work with especially in target oncology. Should we be expecting more bolt-on acquisitions within these two areas over the course of 2020? Bob Bradway : I don't know about the course of 2020, Dane. We're -- those are two areas of keen interest for us for sure, oncology and inflammation. And we will continue to look for attractive innovative assets that we think we can add value to. The trick is always to be able to license or acquire molecules at a price that leaves return for our shareholders and we're pretty comprehensive in the way we assess the marketplace and we'll continue to keep an active watch and see whether there are some things that might be a good fit. Dane Leone : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer, your line is open. Umer, you may have us on mute. And moving on to the next question is from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Alethia, your line is open. Alethia Young : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. I guess, I just wanted to know when you think about the Otezla, some of the benefits you are seeing with the orals maybe in the might be COVID, do you think that might be a sustainable turn? Thanks Murdo Gordon : Alethia, I just want to clarify, its Murdo here. You are talking about clinical trial activity with those as well. Alethia Young : No, not that activity. Murdo Gordon : Yes, we\u2019re -- look we continue to watch the weekly trends. We\u2019re listening to what our customer are telling us and we definitely think that we\u2019ve got a little bit of buffer supporting Otezla right now because it is a convenient oral option. It's got great market excess coverage. It's affordable. We\u2019re -- obviously also we mentioned the end of last year that we were putting in additional primary care effort to broaden the promotional effort behind Otezla and I think that\u2019s also helping. So we\u2019re feeling good about it and I think it\u2019s the ideal kind of product or time like this where a lot of patients are concerned about visiting healthcare professional. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Geoffrey, your line is open. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you very much. Follow up for Murdo, another question. You highlighted some of the softness that you\u2019re seeing in March and then continuing to April for some of the office injectables. Could you give us a sense of which product you think are most likely to be most significantly affected. I think you particularly highlighted the Prolia visits that might be down as much as 50% to those relative specialties. Is that what we should be expecting for Prolia in Q2? Murdo Gordon : Yes I think -- thank you, Geoff. I think what I mentioned was the patient visits were down 50%. Prolia were maybe not has impacted yet on Evenity or definitely the products that we\u2019re seeing most impact in our portfolio. If you think about the physician administered products for Amgen and three business, we have our business. We have our nephrology business. We have our oncology business. Bone is by far the business that is being impacted the most. Obviously, it\u2019s partly to do with the age and vulnerability of patients and we\u2019re spending a lot of time working on alternate sites of care and proving continuity of care, setting up mobile programs where nurses can visit patients homes and administer and we\u2019re working with the administration CMS policy, advocates to try and improve the buy-and-bill access to that home injection channel as well. Nephrology is holding up well. Obviously in renal disease these patients have to have their dialysis is life sustaining. So those volumes are holding up well. The providers there have been very good at collaborating and providing safe isolated sites of care for patients. And then oncology, it's down but not nearly as much as the bone. So that gives you a relative order of understanding of how we're seeing it. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory, your line is open. Cory Kasimov : Great. Good evening guys. Thanks for taking my question. Given the importance of this growth portfolio to the overall business, I wanted to better understand the underlying dynamics for Aimovig. We look at it I mean despite the leading share position and an increase in paid prescriptions sales have seemingly fallen short of expectations for the last few quarters. Is this just a function of lower net price with the broader access? Or is there something else going on that we're all missing? Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks Cory. Look, we're very pleased with Aimovig's share performance. And we did have to do quite a bit of work over the course of the year to get to that 90% paid level. And now we have 93% of covered lives. So we're pretty pleased about that basis. I think what we're counting on for growth going forward because we expect price to stabilize throughout the course of the balance of the year is we're coming on unlocking additional patient volume. We've got over four million potential CGRP patient candidates out there. Physicians tend to persist with older oral products and aren't yet adopting CGRP products at the rate that we think that they could and should be to help ease the suffering of chronic migraine sufferer. So that's where we're focused. We're focused on unlocking the future potential volume now that these products and particularly Aimovig has a very affordable access coverage in the market. Operator : And it appears that we have Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI back on. Umer, your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi. I just learned how to unmute myself. So thank you so much. David, one question for you, if I may. I think it will be very helpful for investors to understand if you're optimistic on the durability of response with KRAS monotherapy? And if you're starting to develop a view whether a MEK or a PD-1 as a better combination partner? Thank you so much. Dave Reese : Thank you, Umer, for the question. Yes. I mean, I think duration of response is one of the critical questions and that's why I indicated that -- the Phase II trial I think is going to give us the definitive answer there. That will -- and we wish to have enough follow-up to very robustly address both duration of response and progression-free survival. In terms of the combinations, I think it's perhaps a little too early to pick favorites. We are looking at a number of combinations, which is typical for oncology programs. All of those are based on an underlying biologic rationale. And as I indicated, we'll be generating data in that program in combinations over the course of this year. Operator : And next we have a question from the line of Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim. Michael, your line is open. Michael Schmidt : Hi, guys. Good evening and thanks for taking my question. I had a high-level question on the biosimilar business, which has been going really well for Amgen. I'm just wondering, as we see sort of the biosimilar market mature longer-term and then as we see potentially more product launch within these markets, I guess, what is your view on the long-term price erosion relative to brand? And how should we think about a potential floor relative to the manufacturing and development costs in the biosimilar area? Thank you. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks, Michael. The one thing I mentioned earlier in response to the question of biosimilars was the Amgen experience in knowing how to make biologics at scale in a very efficient way. So we have really good margins on this business. And I think going by our experience in Europe, where I would argue that the price degradation has probably been faster than it will be in the U.S., even with multiple competitors, we've been able to compete effectively for volume and we've been able to retain a very profitable business there. We, obviously, don't have a lot of analogs in the U.S. to understand the rate of change, so I'm going to hold back from speculating on what the future will hold. But there are clear things here that the more competitors you have compressed in the early phase of a biosimilar launch path, the more likely there is to be some precipitous price erosion. We're fortunate that we were early in the U.S. with both MVASI and KANJINTI and able to establish a very strong foothold in the market. I'll also repeat it, I said it earlier, but I do think that the biosimilar market is alive and well in the U.S. and functioning as you would hope free markets would. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter, your line is open. Carter Gould : Thanks for fitting me in. I guess, maybe, just a bigger picture question around sort of the lasting impact of COVID. When you guys think around, either shift to manufacturing strategy, location, bigger picture questions on footprint and, I guess, as well as commercialization models, I guess, it's just a really kind of a bigger picture question when we return to normal, would that look different to sort of your infrastructure and business model, is how you have set it up historically? Thank you. Bob Bradway : Yes. That's a really interesting question, Carter, and one that I think we'll get a lot of attention once things have settled down a little bit. It's still awfully fluid to be trying to predict how the experience of COVID-19 will affect our industry or our business model. But we'd be happy to engage with you on that topic at greater length, again, when the dust has settled a little bit. But fundamentally for us, our supply chain is in great shape. We, unlike some of our peers in the industry predominantly manufacture in the U.S. obviously -- even the people who work for us there are U.S. citizens and so we have the benefit that the vast majority nearly all of our manufacturing is done in the U.S. That supply chain questions a little bit less relevant for us and some of our industry peers. But I do think that this isn't going to be the last viral challenge that we face as a society and I think we'll all be trying to improve our business continuity planning and thinking when we come out of this to make sure that we're in a strong position as possible to avoid interruptions from events like this. But I think there will be a lot of learning across the whole economy, including the biotech economy. So we look forward to talking, you've got the right time. Operator : And next we have a question from the line of Mohit Bansal with Citi. Mohit, your line is open. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress. I have a quick question regarding your IL-2 mutant program. What is your level of excitement around this program? Seems like you have two fully enrolled trial at this point. Should we expect to see any data from this program later this year? Thank you. Dave Reese : Thanks Mohit. Dave here. Yes, we remain keenly interested in AMG 592 IL-2 mutant, we're enrolling trials going forward and we'd expect data over the course of the year or perhaps early next year. Some of those trials we did temporarily pause because of the reluctance of investigators to start patients on new immunomodulatory agents in the course of the epidemic. But we remain quite interested in that program and we'll provide guidance as to when we're going to get data readout as we move forward. Operator : And next we have a question from the line of Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets. Kennen, your line is open. Kennen MacKay : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for Peter or Bob. Actually I'd love to hear Dr. Reese perspective. I was wondering where are you seeing the most opportunity for M&A and really where you're focused there? And Dave I had hoped to include you in that question really just to get your perspective on where some of the most interesting biology and chemistry is taking place now and what Bob have referred to so eloquently as the golden age of biotechnology? Thanks so much. Bob Bradway : Well, Dave, since I have I talked a little bit about M&A business development already on the call, why don't we let you take a crack at this. So, what areas, what mechanisms are most intriguing to you and your R&D colleagues at the moment? Dave Reese : Yes, I think it is a golden age and I would approach it from two perspectives. There are new platforms. And our Head of Research, she has published a very great article in nature a week or two ago. I'd encourage all of you to read about what we call an induced proximity platform. This is a new suite of technologies that we think can open up much of the undependable space, so that sort of business development remains of great interest to us. And then as we've said before, I think there's a ferment of activity across the therapeutic areas of great interest to us and that will continue to be a focus going forward. Operator : And next we have a question from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho. Salim, your line is open. Salim Syed : Great. Thanks so much for that question guys. Bob maybe just one for you just a high level one. Given your discussions with folks in Washington, obviously the rhetoric in biotech and pharma, as well has been pretty negative over the last few years especially around drug pricing etcetera. And I'm wondering with given this COVID-19 has that changed the rhetoric at all in your view? And is there anything sustainably positive that can carry on post-COVID in terms of rhetoric coming out of Washington in your view? Thank you. Bob Bradway : Well I think everybody recognizes that we're going to need science and innovation to lead us out of this challenge that we find ourselves in globally. So -- importance of innovation and a little bit of humility perhaps in all camps about how hard it is to have the right innovation available for the world at the right time. So the good news is that the government, innovators, academia everybody are working together at a speed and a scale that I've never seen in my career. So I think that's a good sign and hopefully we'd be able to look back on this one day and say that it works. We've got a special ecosystem in particular in this country. And hopefully, we'll be able to look back and say when we faced the biggest challenge of our lifetimes the industry came through and delivered what we needed. And if we're able to do that I think it inevitably will help remind everybody that we haven't generated all the innovation we need as a society. There are still lots of areas of unmet medical need. And again, the more we can do to address it the better. But the question of drug pricing is not going to go away but hopefully there'll be some respect for how profoundly important innovation is. Arvind Sood : And let's take one last question if there's a quick one. After which I'll ask Bob to make some concluding comments. Operator : Very well. Our final question is from the line of Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo Securities. Jim your line is open. Nick Abbott : Good afternoon. It's Nick on for Jim. Thanks all very much for squeezing us in. You had mentioned earlier in your prepared comments about Otezla, the role of Otezla in COVID. Can you just elaborate on that? And is this in the acute setting? Or perhaps is there an opportunity for patients who have ongoing organ dysfunction after they leave hospital maybe due to inflammation? Dave Reese : Well thanks James, this is Dave. Yes we think it's actually -- there will be utility in studying Otezla in a variety of settings ranging from for example hospitalized patients but those that are not yet in the ICU to attempt to prevent progression to more serious disease as well as those with more serious disease. And so again we're in active discussions or have committed to platform trials. The one real guiding principle we have here is that we want these to be rigorous studies to provide the highest quality answers. Bob Bradway : Okay. Let me just wrap up recognizing that it's pushing on 7 :00 on the East Coast. Again let me reiterate our appreciation for you joining the call. I hope what you take away from the call is that, we delivered a solid quarter one. We feel we're executing the business. Well our objective will be to remain an effective steward of the business through the short term. We want to be a leading corporate citizen through this challenging period as well and we will remain focused on delivering long-term growth by advancing innovation in those areas that you're familiar with at Amgen. So thank you all. Keep safe. Look forward to catching up with you on the next quarterly call. Arvind Sood : Thanks everybody. Myself and the IR team will be around for some time. So feel free to reach out to us. Thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you greatly for joining us for Amgen's First Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. This does conclude the call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the ChemoCentryx Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call will be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Bill Slattery of Burns McClellan. Mr. Slattery, please go ahead. Bill Slattery : Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to the ChemoCentryx second quarter 2020 financial results conference call. Earlier this afternoon, the company issued a press release providing an overview of its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2020. This press release, along with a few slides that you may find helpful while you listen to this call, are available on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website at www.chemocentryx.com. Joining me on the call today is Dr. Thomas Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer of ChemoCentryx, who will review the company\u2019s recent business and clinical progress. Following his comments, Susan Kanaya, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer of ChemoCentryx, will provide an overview of the company\u2019s financial highlights for the second quarter 2020 before turning the call back over to Tom for closing remarks. During today\u2019s call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, which those of you following the slides can see if you look at Slide 2. These forward-looking statements are based on current information, assumptions and expectations that are subject to change and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These risks are described in the company\u2019s filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 10, 2020 and its Form 10-Q filed on May 11, 2020. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and ChemoCentryx disclaims any obligation to update such statements.

With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Tom Schall. Tom? Thomas Schall : Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon to everyone listening. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2020 conference call. I will report to you today on what I believe is the impressive progress in executing on the 2020 goals that we laid out for you at the start of the year. But who could have guessed them just how far and fast this pandemic would spread, or how long it might last. Our hearts go out to all of those affected, to their friends and families and to all the healthcare workers who are fighting COVID-19. The COVID crisis has affected us all. Here at ChemoCentryx, we were already at or near full enrollment in our current cycle of clinical trials when the full force of the pandemic struck, and we expect to initiate our next cycle of clinical trials next year. We have, therefore, been able to meet most of the milestones that we set out for ourselves this year, with relatively little impact, while taking actions to safeguard the health of our employees. We are continuing to make key hires and build out a team ahead of the anticipated commercial launch of avacopan in 2021. The coronavirus has led to heightened awareness of the importance of the body\u2019s own defense mechanisms and to the crucial role that the immune system plays. And as you can see from Slide 3, our discovery and development efforts focus on small molecule therapeutics that targets specific chemoattractant receptors. These are the receptors that activate inflammatory cells in autoimmune diseases. We started in renal disease, but have leveraged our science into dermatology as well and have now even branched out into a new era in oncology. At the core of it all is the belief that a precise mechanism of action helps to achieve precision medicine. Our drug candidates are designed for antiinflammatory properties without broad immunosuppression, so that the immune system can remain fully focused on its mission to resist illness and disease. This is an important differentiating feature from other currently standard therapies for the diseases in which we at ChemoCentryx are developing new medicines. Our lead candidate, avacopan, selectively targets the C5a receptor, switching off the inappropriate activation of harmful neutrophils in complement-driven diseases. In early July, as shown on Slide 4, we submitted our new drug application to the FDA for avacopan in the treatment of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. We expect to hear back from the FDA later this quarter with regard to next steps in the FDA-review process. We are working also intensively with our partner, Vifor Pharma, as we and they gear up for the potential commercialization of avacopan outside of the U.S. Vifor will pay us royalties in the teens to the mid-20s on net sales outside the United States. Vifor plans to file a marketing approval authorization with the European Medicines Agency by the end of this year 2020. And we are working closely with them as they prepare their MAA using our core technical document from the FDA preparations as the key source. Our applications to regulatory agencies and our preparations for the anticipated commercialization of avacopan are built upon the key findings in the ADVOCATE pivotal trial. As a reminder, ADVOCATE compared our new targeted therapy of avacopan, against what has been the current standard of care, which contains high and chronic doses of glucocorticoids such as prednisone. We looked at clinical effects in the avacopan therapy group in comparison to the prednisone or steroid therapy group rather in a randomized, blinded, controlled worldwide Phase III trial of ANCA vasculitis patients. We believe the ADVOCATE findings demonstrate a compelling value proposition in terms of avacopan\u2019s potential to meet the four major unmet needs of ANCA vasculitis patients. First stopping ANCA vasculitis. Avacopan therapy was statistically superior in sustaining remission of ANCA vasculitis at 52 weeks compared to the prednisone containing standard of care group. Second, eliminating the need for chronic steroid therapy and the many illnesses associated with that current chronic steroid containing standard of care. In the ADVOCATE trial, avacopan patients achieved a significant reduction in the toxicities and illnesses known to be related to steroids. Third, stopping the accumulated organ damage that comes with this deadly and debilitating disease. Avacopan therapy led to improved kidney function and its use produced a statistically significant improvement in the estimated glomerular filtration rate, a key metric of kidney function. Fourth, an improvement in quality of life. Too many ANCA patients experienced poor quality of life, feeling listless, ill, and lacking in anything like normal vitality. From ADVOCATE, there was good news here, too, a statistically significant improvement in clinically validated measurements of quality of life on avacopan therapy. And overall, avacopan also demonstrated a favorable safety result in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having fewer numbers of serious adverse events in the avacopan group than in the steroid standard of care group. Results of the ADVOCATE trial were featured in oral plenary sessions during the annual meetings of both the EULAR, or European League Against Rheumatism; and ERA-EDTA, the European Renal Association - European Dialysis and Transplant Association meetings. At ERA-EDTA, for example, Dr. David Jayne from Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital in Cambridge, England, presented some remarkable data on EGFR improvements from the ADVOCATE trial. Slide 5 shows that 80% of ADVOCATE patients who entered the trial had defined renal impairment. In this group, their baseline EGFR, which was well balanced between the two groups, was on average about 45 ml per min. Avacopan therapy improved that EGFR by nearly 8 ml per min over 52 weeks of therapy, which was significantly better than the prednisone containing active comparative group. In fact, the graph on the right depicts the finding that some nephrologists have described to me as remarkable. In the lowest tertile of these patients, those with EGFR less than 30 ml per min baseline and, in fact, these individuals, their baseline EGFR was about 21 ml per min. Avacopan, by the way, this baseline of this tertile is only about 5 or 6 ml per min away from being a dialysis candidate. In this group, avacopan therapy boosted their EGFR by almost 14 ml per min over the 52 weeks. This result shows that we have not only met our goal of stabilizing or preserving what kidney function remains in this disease state, and in so doing, potentially sparing patients from dialysis. But, in fact, the data suggests that avacopan may actually improve renal function over time in a very significant way. We believe that avacopan therapy offers new hope for patients suffering from ANCA vasculitis, and importantly, could rid them of the toxic consequences of the use of a steroid \u2013 of a therapy developed more than a half a century ago, steroids. There were some other subtle, but notable findings from the ADVOCATE study. One of these, for example, is that patients on avacopan therapy performed very well in the second six months of the trial. During this period, avacopan was essentially a monotherapy since the standard concomitant background therapies, such as cyclophosphamide or rituximab have ceased. The data suggests that avacopan alone may suffice in controlling ANCA vasculitis over time, perhaps without the need for repeated administrations of background immunosuppressive drugs such as rituximab. While more clinical data may be needed to draw firmer conclusions, given the importance of preserving the immune function as we anticipate vaccines in the era of COVID-19, this could be a crucial benefit. We are continuing to move forward with our plans for potential commercial launch, as you will see on Slide 6. Our aim is be \u2013 is to be ready to launch soon after FDA approval. We have secured commercial batches of avacopan that we need for launch. We continue to hire well-qualified candidates for key positions, expanding the capabilities of our commercial operation. And we broadened and deepened our knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the U.S. ANCA vasculitis market through intensive market research. We\u2019re also taking appropriate educational opportunities to present data on the disease and on the findings from the ADVOCATE study to clinicians in both nephrology, rheumatology and other relevant disciplines. And we\u2019ve initiated discussions with key payers to raise their awareness of the current unmet needs and burdens of ANCA vasculitis. We plan to field a specialty force of approximately 60 to 75 people to launch avacopan in the U.S. ANCA vasculitis is a disease that is estimated in the published literature to ravage anywhere between 40,000 and 100,000 people in the U.S., an estimated 4,000 to 9,000 cases alone, new cases are diagnosed each year in the United States. Given the strong value proposition suggested by the ADVOCATE data, we believe that avacopan\u2019s utility could extend beyond ANCA vasculitis, making avacopan a pipeline in a drug and with strong patent protection.Given the strong kidney benefit finding in ADVOCATE, we continue to refine our pipeline and expect to introduce avacopan into \u2013 for lupus nephritis into clinical development in the first-half of 2021. And as you can see from Slide 7, we expect to report top line data and two more indications this year. Indeed, avacopan\u2019s ability to stifle the activation of destructive neutrophils by jamming the C5a receptor represents a precision approach that is relevant not only in kidney diseases, but potentially outside the renal space as well. In fact, the first top line data that we will report this year is in Hidradenitis Suppurativa, the disabling skin disorder. HS is driven by neutrophils that are thought to be activated by the C5a receptor. Endovasculitis complement dysregulation is almost universal in HS patients. Our AURORA study, depicted on Slide 8, is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase IIb or clinical trial of approximately 390 patients with moderate to severe HS, with patients randomized to one of three arms. The primary endpoint is the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response Score, or HiSCR, after 12 weeks of treatment. We designed the trial to be powered to a registration grade level and decided to slightly over enroll in order to provide some cushion for anticipated COVID-related loss patient follow-up. As I mentioned earlier, the COVID crisis has affected us all. We at CCXI are no exception, but the impacts have been less grievous for us than for others. Still while the majority of our subjects had already enrolled in the AURORA trial before the full impact of the pandemic, the summer resurgence of COVID-19 has led to the renewed, if temporary restrictions of some of the clinical sites. It is, therefore, likely that this will impact somewhat the normal processes of data collection and verification that then lead to database locking and subsequent data analysis. These processes, which are routine to any clinical study, are likely to going to be modestly delayed in AURORA owing to COVID. Thus, we predict that the reporting of the 12-week top line results originally forecast for Q3 is now expected early in Q4. To be clear, no unblinded data are yet in hand. No unblinding or any other unblinded analyses have yet occurred in this trial, w are merely predicting a modest delay in reporting as a consequence of COVID delays. I\u2019m often asked how we are dealing with the placebo issue in HS. The primary endpoint assessment known as HiSCR has an unavoidable element of subjectivity. But it is the standard that the FDA expects sponsors to use in determining clinical effects in HS and ultimately, the standard by which they will assess for an approval of a new therapeutic agent. We have been very careful to attempt to minimize subjectivity in HiSCR. For example, we have carefully selected sites, which are all in the U.S., allowing a high touch approach and also in a healthcare system, which tends to keep placebo responses in check. We have engaged a training program of intensive training, standardization and monitoring. For example, first to training. Suffice it to say, we train, train, train and principal investigators had to pass a certification test on HiSCR to qualify to enroll patients. Standardization, we developed and mandated the use of standardized records and continuous worksheets across the clinical sites. And finally, monitoring. During the blinded data collection phase, our resident medical monitor scans nearly daily for anomalies in the data collection and is in frequent contact with the investigator also \u2013 who is also still blinded, and they joined the result any recording anomalies using our standard protocol. In all of these ways and more, we are scrupulously attempting to control what we can control to reduce variability and placebo response in the HiSCR assessment. Our other current avacopan trial is in another kidney indication, C3 glomerulopathy. C3G is a rare and devastating kidney disease. There is no FDA-approved therapy for C3G. ACCOLADE is a randomized, blinded controlled trial, the design of which is shown on Slide 9. The trial is unique in many ways, including that we will collect and carefully measure kidney biopsy data as a measure of efficacy, and this will be coupled with other traditional markers of kidney function. Many experts suggest that we are already in possession of the largest and most comprehensive data set, albeit still blinded, for C3G yet assembled for this life-threatening illness. We aim to announce top line data for the ACCOLADE trial by the end of this year. Innovation in life sciences does not come up without its setbacks, and our risk came with the disappointing top line results from our LUMINA-1 trial of CCX140 in focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. We don\u2019t see a way forward for CCX140 in FSGS. In the interest of biomedical innovation and completion, we will report more detailed LUMINA-1, as well as the smaller LUMINA-2 data sets in due course. On a brighter note, see Slide 10. And also in the second quarter, we announced that we have identified an orally administered checkpoint inhibitor, CCX559, formerly referred to as CCX6559, which we plan to advance in the clinical development in the first-half of this coming year in 2021. Data presented in June at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research showed that our optimized checkpoint inhibitors lead to a marked inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction in vitro, and importantly, produced a potent anti-tumor effects in vitro in pharmacological models. We believe that CCX559 has the potential to be used alone or in combination with antibody therapy, or other oncology therapies. Our small molecule checkpoint inhibitor is designed to address at least two limitations of current antibody checkpoint inhibitor therapy : one, a small molecule may achieve better penetration of the tumor microenvironment, where some tumors are currently resistant to antibody therapy; two, a small molecule brings the convenience of a flexible dosing capability. Before I turn the call over to Susan Kanaya for our financial results, let me add that during the quarter, we have further strengthened our balance sheet with a follow-on offering that yielded net proceeds of almost $326 million. We report today over $0.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet as of the end of the second quarter. This financial strength supplies many important degrees of freedom in pursuing our ultimate mission. We believe that we have the resources we need for the potential commercial launch of avacopan and ANCA vasculitis and beyond. We can pursue the simultaneous further development of avacopan and other high-need, high-value clinical indications, as well as additional formulations. And we can follow the science and invest in other novel and highly innovative drug candidates, such as our orally-administered checkpoint inhibitor, CCX559. My warmest thanks to all my colleagues at ChemoCentryx, especially in these difficult times, for their tireless work and advancing us to this stage and to the many clinicians involved in our clinical trials. And I think, especially the patients and their families, who have devoted so much to our controlled-blinded trials, not knowing if an active agent was part of their personal plan, but doing so for the benefit of the community as a whole. Susan? Susan Kanaya : Thank you, Tom. Our second quarter 2020 financial results were included in our press release today and are summarized on Slide 11. Revenue was $49.4 million for the second quarter, compared to $7.2 million for the same period in 2019. The increase in total revenue was primarily due to the acceleration of revenue recognition associated with CCX140 agreement with Vifor. Following the decision to discontinue development of CCX140 in FSGS, $47.2 million of deferred revenue was recognized as contract revenue. Research and development expenses were $18.8 million for the second quarter of 2020, compared to $17.6 million in the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to patient enrollment in the avacopan AURORA trial in patients with Hidradenitis Suppurativa, professional fees associated with the preparation of our avacopan NDA for ANCA-associated vasculitis and higher drug development or drug discovery expenses, including those associated with CCX55, our orally-administered small molecule PD-L1 inhibitor. These increase were partially offset by lower expenses due to the full enrollment of CCX140 LUMINA-1 trial in 2019. General and administrative expenses were $10.3 million for the second quarter, compared to $5.6 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, including those associated with our commercialization planning efforts and higher professional fees. Net income for the second quarter was $20.3 million, compared to net loss of $15.2 million in the same quarter of 2019. Total shares outstanding at June 30, 2020 were approximately 68.8 million shares. Lastly, we closed the quarter with $504.6 million and reported cash, cash equivalents and investments, including the $325.7 million in net proceeds from the June 2020 equity follow-on offering of our common stock. Tom? Thomas Schall : Thank you, Susan. To summarize, as you can see on Slide 12, we have filed an NDA for avacopan and ANCA vasculitis and our partner, Vifor, expects to file an MAA in Europe by the end of 2020. We continue to build our commercial capability. We are on track to release top line results from two further clinical trials of avacopan in patients with HS by early Q4 and with C3G by the end of the year. We are preparing for our next cycle of pipeline advancements, and we anticipate initiating clinic programs in the first-half of 2021 for our orally-administered checkpoint inhibitor, CCX559, as well as for avacopan in patients with lupus nephritis. We have attracted the financial resources that we need, with now over a $0.5 billion on the balance sheet at the end of Q2, to drive us to the next phase of our growth as we seek to become a fully integrated pharmaceutical enterprise that brings fundamentally new medicines to patients that need them most. This ChemoCentryx enterprise is built on biomedical innovation, on determination, on integrity, and on purposeful resilience. With science and data illuminating the path ahead, I look forward into a future based with the bright light of hope and prosperity. With that, I will now turn the call back over to the operator, and we look forward to your questions. Operator? Q - Steven Seedhouse : Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. My question is on the analysis of AURORA, given the different moving parts you highlighted on the call. So I was hoping if you could quantify the net impact of COVID, any discontinuations or patients missing their final visit versus over enrolling the study and where it leads you really with respect to study power? And also wondering, is the primary analysis here in ITT analysis or a protocol analysis on those patients that haven\u2019t deviated from protocol? And then last, how are you treating the patients who may have missed their final study visit because of COVID impact? Are those responses imputed from prior measurements like LCOF, or are they just sensored? Thank you. Thomas Schall : Yes, great. Great question, Steve. So it is \u2013 all of our analyses are intended as ITT, because as I said, we made this trial kind of a registration grade trial, since it\u2019s \u2013 but even though it\u2019s a \u201cPhase II or Phase IIb trial.\u201d So our intention will be to report the stats as intent to treat. We will obviously do and have in our stats plan pre-specified various kinds of protocol analyses. So those data will be informative and meaningful as well. Currently, we\u2019ve been \u2013 and obviously, we and others have been really careful in documenting the effects of COVID on patients, particularly for primary endpoint determination, working very carefully with FDA and documenting in real-time, what we\u2019re doing with those folks. At the moment, we do not intend the last observation carry-forward necessarily for those that missed their 12-week visit owing to COVID. But they certainly will capture all the data we can from those folks, particularly if they\u2019re still on the trial and are measured thereafter. So those might be eliminating data as well. But I think the good news is that the first part of your question, which is the \u2013 I think, probably the most important part. Although, yes, it is clear that, that dropouts and some loss data owing to COVID is going to be higher than what we and others might have modeled. The fortunate news is I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to \u2013 it\u2019s not going to materially impair our ability to still have very good power in this trial. So that\u2019s, I think, for us, the excellent news. We really made a big trial with big groups. It was very highly power to detect the differences that historically, we might be led to expect and certainly highly powdered to detect statistical differences between the groups. So even a doubling, if you will, and I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the number, but even if we had twice the number of dropouts or lost data at 12 weeks, I think, we\u2019ve still got really good power discrimination. So I fundamentally believe that we\u2019ll be able to return a meaningful and clean result from the 12-week data, even with the fact that COVID has messed with some of that data a little bit. And really, the biggest impact for us is a slight delay as we get into the sites and do our data verification and collection process. Steven Seedhouse : I appreciate the detailed answer. Thank you. Thomas Schall : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Dae Gon Ha with BTIG. Your line is now open. Dae Gon Ha : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking our questions, and congrats on all the progress. So, Tom, if we can go to AURORA protocol, I just wanted to ask, can you remind us what the protocol allows in terms of antibiotic usage? Because I mean, I guess, PIONEER 1 and 2, they did have a little bit of that antibiotic usage versus non-antibiotic usage. And as we look forward in terms of the regulatory front, can you update us on your latest thought process with regards to maybe orphan drug designation or conditional filing/AA or accelerated approval based on AURORA date alone? Thomas Schall : Sure. Thank you, Dae Gon. Without going into all the details on the antibiotic use, I can tell you that we\u2019re much closer to the PIONEER studies than we were to any other studies. We realized that concomitant antibiotic use can be a confounding feature in the short-term in ascribing effects to the HiSCR. And so we were pretty careful about looking back at what had happened in PIONEER 1 and 2 and trying to adhere to those guidelines. And also making sure that to the extent possible, we didn\u2019t have imbalances in antibiotic uses between the group. So, again, I think, we\u2019ve been very cognizant of that as a complicating feature and trying to avoid it as a complicating factor in our interpretation. Back to the regulatory strategy, so it\u2019s \u2013 the history is clear on what\u2019s gone before. We\u2019re evaluating the Hurley stage II/III patient population, as did the PIONEER studies, which were the studies as people may know, are the only Phase III pivotal trials that led to so far the single loan registration of a drug in this space, that for adalimumab, the anti-TNF drug Humira. Hence, we want to try to avail ourselves as much as we can from information from that President. So interestingly, that sponsor got an orphan drug designation for Hurley stage II/III, because that patient population is under 200,000 people in the U.S., and that is still the case. So we have \u2013 we\u2019ve been attempting and continue to work on our orphan drug designation. We don\u2019t yet have that designation yet to ChemoCentryx. But there is precedent, and we\u2019ve been certainly working on that continuously. So we yet to know if we get that orphan drug designation. But again, there is precedent for it. We fundamentally believe that Hurley stage II/III patients are still fewer than 200,000 in the United States at this juncture. So with all of that in mind, getting back to the \u2013 one of the main points of the question, we set up this trial to be big enough and highly powered enough, where we got really good data with a highly differentiated agent, particularly one which at that time was not yet in registration for another indication But we had confidence that it would be. And that\u2019s what that has come to past that we are filed \u2013 we are actually \u2013 have a filing under review for registration of avacopan and ANCA vasculitis. We were \u2013 we have been hopeful that with strong data, we could have an interesting discussion with the FDA about potentially a conditional registration or at least how to get to an accelerated path to registration, again, with strong data. So, again, without going into a lot of details, and certainly, I do not at all speak for the agency and the agency will just have to see what data we have as we will, and then we will discuss from there. I think it\u2019s really great news, though, that there\u2019s a huge \u2013 it seems to me a huge demand, not just for new therapy in HS, but new orally active therapy. And so, again, even COVID notwithstanding, but certainly prior to COVID, we really enrolled to this study very rapidly. And I think that again speaks to the eagerness of folks in this community to have a new therapy options. So we\u2019ll see how strong the data is. We\u2019ll have discussions with the agency. And in the light of \u2013 if data are positive, we will do everything that we possibly can to bring the drug to registration in this indication as quickly as possible. Dae Gon Ha : Great. Thanks for taking our questions. Look forward to the data. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Dae Gon. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michelle Gilson with Canaccord. Your line is now open. Michelle Gilson : Hi, Tom. Hi, Susan. Congratulations on the progress this quarter. I was hoping you could expand a little bit on what might be considered a clinically significant result in HS, or perhaps what is a strong enough result that would give you confidence to move the program forward either to registration or to registration-enabling studies? And then could you also help us understand what you might report in the fourth quarter as far as data goes? Maybe what per protocol analyses you might present? And if you specifically will be breaking out Humira failures, and maybe remind us of the powering of the study, if you don\u2019t mind as well? Thomas Schall : Sure. So it\u2019s \u2013 all of those are really excellent questions, Michelle, thank you for them. We have so little precedent in the world of Hidradenitis Suppurativa in controlled trials that are informative. To really help us guide some of those answers, I\u2019ll take some guesses. And certainly, we have, again, for lack of a better term, an endpoint, which is a strong tool, but not a very sharp tool. It\u2019s not a precise tool. And the element of variability and subjectivity, again, makes it a little bit difficult to always try to compare apples-to-apples, particularly when there has only been one or two apples in the bin before. So let me say this that as a general rule, anything that gets me to a clear answer about a next step, to me is a success. So, if we see clear separation between the groups, and if some of the secondaries look also supportive, and we say to ourselves, \u201cWell, it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re having a clinical effect and need a clinical benefit.\u201d That\u2019s a good answer. Hopefully, we won\u2019t get the other kind of clear answer, which is there\u2019s nothing here, but we\u2019ve done our best. But again, even a good clean answer on that side of the equation just allows us to focus on other areas that we can put our time, effort and treasure. So getting back to, we always like \u2013 people always like to say, \u201cWell, what would an interesting difference be?\u201d For me, any statistical separation, that\u2019s significant? I will say, let\u2019s look very carefully at that. And with this kind of instrument careful as we already use it as carefully as we can, that probably is meaningful. So we would, at minimum, like to see a statistical separation, obviously, with the HiSCR. And the only precedent we have about what\u2019s good for registration, what\u2019s strong enough for registration, is what we\u2019ve seen before and the one drug that\u2019s been registered. And somewhere a delta of between 20% and 30%, 25% to 30% with, obviously, the bigger number going to be the new agents. In that case, it was adalimumab over the background therapy. That\u2019s the one regulatory precedent we have for registration. So I think it could be argued that something approaching that is pretty strong data since that\u2019s all we have so far. And again, we\u2019ll just have to see how the agency thinks about these things. It\u2019s pretty clear they like they want to stay with HiSCR. They\u2019ve been very clear to the community about that. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re using. We\u2019ve \u2013 we will report essentially \u2013 and you\u2019ll recall in this trial, we\u2019ve committed to talking about the 12-week primary endpoint data. We also have some additional open \u2013 it\u2019s open label, but blinded to dose of a continued dosing for 24 weeks. So we\u2019ve got some special challenges here in trying to preserve the integrity of this data set, while presenting top line data, which will essentially be aggregate data between the groups that will tell us whether there is a difference between any of the dose groups In the placebo. So definitely, we\u2019ll have that information and that will be valuable and, in fact, will tell us whether we achieve the primary endpoint of a statistical separation between drug taking folks and placebo-taking folks. The powering on that is \u2013 was established quite early on, and I think we\u2019ve talked a little bit about it. Originally, we were powered to see about a 90% \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, 90% powered or greater to see the historical standard of a 20% difference. Again, I don\u2019t think even with all of the challenges of COVID, we probably have something pretty good, still very good power in that way. So I\u2019m not worried about a material depowering of the study in anyway. So I think, again, we\u2019ll get a clean answer. But the whole point is, if we get a nice strong resolve on the primary endpoint, we want to have a dataset of preserved integrity. So that when we take the follow-up phase, we can use the entirety of the data with a discussion with the FDA. And again, ask how could this support registration or inform a registration? So that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be talking about sometime in Q4 when we bring the data forward. Michelle Gilson : Okay. Thank you so much, Tom. Thomas Schall : You\u2019re welcome, Michelle. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ted Tenthoff with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Ted Tenthoff : Thank you for all the updates. Tim, congrats on the success. It\u2019s been really an exciting year. So I\u2019m trying to understand sort of how the data \u2013 hoping that it\u2019s positive from HS and/or C3G could impact AAV approval? So it would be supplemental filings, but would you need to wait for the AAV approval to file for the other indications? I\u2019m just trying to sort of understand the sequence of that with respect to regulatory filings? Thanks so much. Thomas Schall : Well, Ted, thank you. I hesitate to applying on regulatory details, since my regulatory expert is not on the phone today. We have an excellent team at ChemoCentryx, who does this work. But my understanding is that probably while each filing and, of course, the background materials in each filing, such as the manufacturing and chemistry controls, et cetera, obviously, the cumulative databases in other ways, safety, et cetera, those support any individual filing, probably each indication would be taken in its own turn. So \u2013 and point of fact from a pragmatic aspect, ANCA vasculitis filing will be moving along on the calendar already in its own way, in its own pace. And we\u2019ll \u2013 we probably have that process well underway by the time the other filings got put in. And again, without being entirely familiar with the details, because each of these indications is also at separate divisions within the FDA. I presume that those divisions while obviously cooperating extensively on the materials would, of course, have their own process. So I think, they\u2019re kind of quasi-independent but, of course, supported by the core technical information. Ted Tenthoff : Well, again, it\u2019s a high quality problem, hopefully, so. Thomas Schall : No, Thank you. Ted Tenthoff : Thank you. Looking forward to the data, guys. Thanks so much. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Yanan Zhu with Wells Fargo Security. Your line is now open. Excuse me, Yanan Zhu, your line is now open. Yanan Zhu : Sorry, I was on mute. Thanks for taking the questions. Regarding the HS study design, there is a 10 mg BID or mid \u2013 kind of a mid-dose arm. Just curious, what \u2013 why was \u2013 because other \u2013 the other studies didn\u2019t include any those arms lower than 30 mg BID. So what\u2019s the reason of including that arm and what we might learn from that arm in the HS study? And also, if you could \u2013 yes, yes, so I\u2019ll take that. I have a follow up after that as well. Thomas Schall : Sure, of course. In point of fact, in one of our Phase II development programs, we did include a 10 mg and a 30 mg dose against know avacopan, all of which was on the background therapy of standard of care. So it was kind of every group got high dose glucocorticoids in daily setting in addition to the combination of either cyclophosphamide or rituximab. So the classical glucocorticoid plus x protocol, where x is either cyclophosphamide or rituximab. So every individual in that Phase II study got that. And then we layered on either 10 mg dose or the 30 mg dose. And while that study was mostly a safety study, to see if there would be any additional safety burdens that avacopan might impose on people, should the drug be used, not that we\u2019re seeking to use it that way, but should someone ever use of avacopan in addition to what they\u2019ve been doing for all these years And then thankfully, there was no safety burden that avacopan brought to that party. We were able to look at 10 and 30 mg. Again, the power \u2013 the study was not powered for efficacy. But there were hints that what we saw with the active effective 30 mg dose in the other trials was present and apparent, even in that setting, where, of course, they were getting standard of care. So there was that to deal with in background, whereas the 10 mg dose was not quite as potent. So we do have some experience. And, of course, we have all of our calculations, both from pharmacological studies that are off-clinical and in the other healthy human volunteer studies to suggest that, at least for the target that we\u2019re going for of pharmacological coverage, essentially pharmacological inertness, if you will, of the receptor at trough levels of the drug, the 10 mg dose falls short of that. So we put it into this study as one of the arms. And essentially, this being a new indication outside the space that we were in before, we wanted to be able to speak to any questions that regulators or others might have. That would be, along the lines of, well, we see that you have some effect at this 30 mg dose. Is that really \u2013 could you go lower and still see an effect in this indication? So we just built that in. And if nothing else, that will inform the dataset. We don\u2019t think that 10 mg dose in that way will have the same pharmacological coverage at all. And so I would be gratifying if the dose response could be seen. Again, given the limitations of HiSCR, that\u2019s always a question. But we wanted to be able to demonstrate to regulators that we had explored dosing at scale in this particular indication. So that\u2019s why we put it in the trial as we did. Yanan Zhu : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then the remaining question is regarding any safety implication from the HS study? More specifically, I think, for the ANCA vasculitis study, the ANCA\u2013 avacopan is used on top of cyclophosphamide or rituximab. So it\u2019s \u2013 the safety-wise, it\u2019s a little hard to see clearly a safety profile because of the background therapy here. I think there is a very good opportunity to demonstrate safety and it\u2019s a large data set. So could you share your thoughts on what \u2013 in addition to efficacy, what kind of safety leverage will this provide to the entire avacopan pipeline? Thanks. Thomas Schall : Yes, very perceptive question, and you\u2019re quite right. In the ANCA patient population, they\u2019re on background therapy for their disease. They\u2019re on also an amazing number typically, an amazing number of concomitant medications to control other complications of the therapy prophylaxis for pneumocystis jirovecii as a consequence of being under high doses of glucocorticoids and/or cyclophosphamide and rituximab. So \u2013 then that has its own problem, that, that concomitant, they\u2019re trying to control their incipient diabetes and some of the bone problems with concomitant. They\u2019re really a challenged patient population. And one hopes going back to avacopan and ANCA vasculitis by removing some of the need for these broadly immunosuppressive therapies, we also get rid of some of these nasty [ph] conmeds that give them so many AEs and SAEs. But even there in ANCA, we could show 40% fewer number of severe AEs in the avacopan group versus the prednisone standard of care group. So there \u2013 is seems to be, at many levels, very good safety advantages to using avacopan. But again, we\u2019ll let regulators and others sit through the data sets, and I won\u2019t say any more about that since it\u2019s under a finding right now. But it is pretty clear to us that, that HS population is by and large notwithstanding the fact that they have this really debilitating illness, and that causes them a lot of discomfort and pain in many areas of life physically and emotionally. They are, by and large, not under the burden of quite so many concomitant medications and the safety database, although still blinded. The suggestion is that we have far fewer across the Board safety events just in this patient population full stop. And again, even in the blinded dataset, nothing that seems out of the ordinary for this patient population. So I think when the data come out, it will certainly add to \u2013 and fundamentally enhance the picture of safety around of avacopan, which we believe based on evidence today, both preclinical, off-clinical, number of species, and humans, both healthy and ANCA vasculitis population, we believe will be a very supportive data package on safety as well. So we hope it will just further enhance that package. And if there are any outstanding questions that come out of ANCA vasculitis, which in a complex patient population, there always could be. But if there are any, we\u2019ve got an equally large data set in Hidradenitis Suppurativa to check whether or not any of those kind events are evident in HS. So I think it\u2019s going to be a real benefit to our overall package and profile. Yanan Zhu : Got it. Thank you, Tom. Very helpful. Thomas Schall : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz with SVB Leerink. Your line is now open. Joseph Schwartz : Thanks very much. Congrats on the progress as well. I was wondering if you could categorize or characterize your payer interactions for us in terms of how well you\u2019re finding that they appreciate the various sources of value that avacopan could deliver in terms of the total cost of patient management, maybe including a lot of the safety liabilities that you were just alluding to in the range of efficacy benefits? Are you finding that anything resonates more or less and how are you thinking about incorporating the feedback you\u2019ve obtained from payers to date in your ultimate pricing decision? Thomas Schall : It\u2019s a great question. We \u2013 again, without going into too many details, and my commercial team, we\u2019re going to be presenting a lot of information at Health Economics Conferences as we get closer to launch. And so those will be very interesting things to watch. But I\u2019m going to say that these interactions to date have been \u2013 we\u2019ve been very pleased with how much payers actually get it in this organ in this particular orphan indication. They totally understand, maybe totally is a bit too strong. But let\u2019s just say that, we\u2019ve been impressed at how much understanding there is out there about the true cost of this kind of disease? You can go out and do the big ticket stuff like dialysis. And so the kidney data was something that was, again very pleasantly a factor in some of those conversations so far. That\u2019s obvious, right? I mean, end stage renal disease will bankrupt our Medicare system if we don\u2019t do something about it overall. It\u2019s about 9% of the total Medicare budget, far more than the entirety of the NIH budget for all medical \u2013 basic medical research, or certainly more than the NIH budget. Just for end stage renal disease, forget everything that leads up to it. But payers \u2013 even if we have to take that out of the equation, which is not \u2013 which is a big factor not to take out, but they understand the hospitalizations are \u2013 which are just a fraction of this big pie of ANCA vasculitis care. There\u2019s astonishing number of hospitalizations per year in the U.S. on the order of what 13,000 or 14,000, they\u2019re not short. It\u2019s not a day or so. It\u2019s seven to 11 days and costs ranging just the cost associated with the anchor codes in the diagnosis and hospitalizations ranging from 100,000 to 150,000. And this is just part \u2013 this is a fraction of the total cost. They get that things like glucocorticoids, maybe are cheap in the bottle, but they\u2019re super expensive to use. They get the \u2013 all the complications and the safety consequences and the absolute diminution of quality of life and the pharmacoeconomics of having people out of work, out of the \u2013 in the healthcare system all the time. So I would say, this is one of those things that you always go into a little bit fearful of the unknown. But so far, hats off to the payers, they\u2019ve been a lot more knowledgeable and a lot more on message and very receptive to the data we\u2019re presenting. So I think that\u2019s been an encouraging part of the journey so far, ad we\u2019ll have more to say about those details a little bit later on in the process. Joseph Schwartz : That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for the insight, Tom. Thomas Schall : Thank you very much, Joe. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Tessa Romero of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tessa Romero : Hi, Tom and Susan, this is Tessa on for Anupam. Thank you for taking our question. So on C3G, there is some competitive activity in the space. What are your thoughts around differentiation here for avacopan C5 inhibition from a mechanistic perspective? And then what is the latest thinking about epidemiology for C3G, where I think the literature can be somewhat variable? Thanks so much. Thomas Schall : Yes, indeed, the literature is really variable. I \u2013 we have a lot of discussions, even within the enterprise about what is the most reliable idea of both incidence and prevalence, just in the U.S., let alone anywhere else in the world. It\u2019s a rare disease that much is true. There\u2019s no question. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s quite as ultra rare as some of the literature suggest that. My own inclination is maybe not. So I think that the treatable patient population in the United States is certainly accessible between \u2013 probably in the low number of thousands and that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re looking at. But it\u2019s hard to know, it is hard to know. Having said that, since there is nothing available for these people, and since they go through this really dismal progression of being young people having end-stage renal disease going into dialysis, maybe getting a transplant, usually from mom or dad, but typically mom, having that transplant fail within a few short years from the same underlying condition going back in dialysis. I mean, this is a bitty \u2013 a really bad grim cycle and very expensive, obviously, for the patients, their families and then, of course, for the healthcare system. So it\u2019s definitely very worthwhile approaching this problem and approaching it from a couple of different angles. I fundamentally hope that we can all find even in a rare disease like that. I think any approach that wins or any couple of approaches that wins is real progress and it will help everybody, because frankly, C3 glomerulopathy, again, one of its mysteries since it\u2019s so rare, is it really one disorder or how many disorders is it? I mean, we keep collapsing different features of kidney disease with complement dysregulation under new titles and C3G is the latest one. I just think of it, generally speaking, as a complement regulated \u2013 I\u2019m sorry complement dysregulated glomerulopathy. So as to differentiation, no one else is attacking what I think is the fundamental question is like, why does the kidney develop this massive inflammatory and eventually self destructive feature at the level of biopsy? And it\u2019s not just that you have all these protein deposits and \u2013 in the part of C3G that used to be called dense deposit disease. It\u2019s not just sort of gunking up the glomeruli. I mean, there is active destruction, I think. And so we know that complement is dysregulated. There is ample evidence for C5a receptor. C5a is more difficult, in my opinion, to detect either at the level of histochemistry or even with soluble detection in the periphery. But C5b-9 is definitely present in these patients. So there\u2019s lots of evidence of terminal complement activation leading to what would be a C5a presence and we believe it\u2019s there in the kidney as well, fundamentally. So we\u2019re the only game in town for stopping what we think is neutrophil-mediated destruction or other granulocytes mediating some of this destruction, other approaches? Yes, there are some and there\u2019s some in the complement intervention space. I think that our orally active drug validated at the level of another very difficult and complicated disease involving the kidneys ANCA vasculitis and validated robustly has to derisk our approach somewhat. And the question will be, is all C3G the same kind of disorder? Or are there going to be subsets that will be more amenable to treatment with one modality versus another? And that will play out, I think, over this next year. But make no mistake, as you know, some of these other approaches have been frustrated and it\u2019s really difficult to understand what\u2019s happening in this disorder. It\u2019s one of the reasons that when we set out, we intentionally decided to do something different. And we said, \u201cLook, C3G is, you can have presumptive C3G and then we do have a lot of biopsy work in this area. So let\u2019s take biopsies. Let\u2019s confirm that you have C3G at the level of biopsy at least and then let\u2019s look again at six months. That\u2019s a real investment on the part of patients and clinicians. But there\u2019s real good evidence that you can \u2013 if you get a histological improvement in and around the glomerulus, that matters, and that may well ultimately then fall into line with reduction in proteinuria, which is sustained, as well as an improvement over time in EGFR. And really, by bringing all these features together, including this biopsy endpoint, we think we\u2019ll be able, for the first time in the history of this disorder, to marry all these features together from a really good blinded data set, collected, blinded, evaluated in the case of histology by a central laboratory, and this should be very powerful. So I think we\u2019re going to have a lot to offer in terms of just knowledge, and I hope I\u2019m very sanguine and you need bullish about therapeutic benefit for some of these people with avacopan. Tessa Romero : Great. Thanks, Tom, for taking our question. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Tessa. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ed White with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open. Ed White : Thank you. Hi, Tom. Hi, Susan. Thomas Schall : Hello, Ed. Ed White : So just a couple of questions. First on ACCOLADE. You\u2019re expecting the top line data by the end of the year. Is that only Stratum 1 or will you be seeing some Stratum 2 data as well? Thomas Schall : That\u2019s a \u2013 again, a very insightful question. Ed, thank you very much for bringing that up. So I \u2013 it\u2019s notable when we talk about the ACCOLADE trial design. And I think we alluded to that on one of the slides. I reminded people again of this biopsy. We \u2013 originally, there\u2019s no approved therapy. So there\u2019s no regulatory path here, by the way, and I think most people understand that. When we set up this trial, there was a \u2013 some really good literature at the time. And this is by way of Stratum 1 and Stratum 2, so that people understand this a little bit better. There was good literature that, that suggested that if you had bonafide C3 glomerulopathy, i.e., active lesions and destruction in your kidney glomeruli, you were probably likely also to have a biomarker of high levels of C5b-9 or soluble MAC complex in your periphery, in your blood, your circulation. And this was a biomarker that was a stable, fairly easy to measure, because C5b-9 is stable and there are good essays for it. And so it would kind of make good sense, right? You\u2019ve got a complement dysregulated kidney disease and there\u2019s a nice biomarker in the blood. So maybe that\u2019s going to be helpful for diagnosis and knowing whether we\u2019re having a therapeutic benefit. So originally, the trial was designed just for those people that have had a relatively high level of C5b-9 in the periphery. As we got the trial design launched and consulted with FDA, there were some other papers that came out that had a kind of opposite point of view. It said, basically said, actually, all the actions in the kidney, don\u2019t worry about what\u2019s happening in the blood, because you could have C3G and have fairly low levels of confidence \u2013 of complement activation markers in the blood, including C5b-9. So what we decided to do is actually get that second Stratum, which is low soluble MAC complex in the trial, so that in a way we could definitively answer the question. And after all, if we had the Stratum 1 trial and got a great result, the next question would be, we\u2019ll do another trial in people with low soluble MAC complex and see if you get the same result. And so we just thought we do it all in one. Now why do I tell you all these things? The fact is when you have presumptive C3G and you then \u2013 and that\u2019s what we do, we look for presumptive C3G, we screen people, we then next take \u2013 we next take their measurements on soluble MAC complex low or high. And then the last step we do is biopsy prove, because that\u2019s the most invasive step. And so, by the \u2013 at least by the standards of this trial design, which was done with consultation with the leading nephrologists in the world in this area, what we know is this. It seems that the original hypothesis is more correct. If you have biopsy proven C3 glomerulopathy, you are likely to present clinically with this marker of high soluble MAC complex. And, in fact, if you have low soluble MAC complex, even if you clinically at presumptive for the C3G, you convert at the level of biopsy, which is the last step at a much smaller rate. So all of that is by way of saying that we will have virtually all of the target of the original Stratum 1. And the Stratum 2, there will be less data only because far fewer people actually have C3G when they have low soluble MAC complex. That\u2019s what our trial design data suggests so far. We\u2019ve haven\u2019t unblinded anything other than knowing that they simply don\u2019t come out on biopsy with C3G anywhere near as frequently when they have low soluble MAC. So we will put out all the data we have in the world, which, again, is probably the bulk of the data that we had from clinical trials on C3G. And we\u2019ve already answered, I think, or at least provided new information on a fundamental clinical question, which was the controversy between soluble MAC high or low, does that equate to C3G in the kidney? That\u2019s a level of biopsy, the level of biopsy. The high soluble MAC complex is much more correlated with C3G. Ed White : Great. Thank you. Thomas Schall : So I won\u2019t give you the detailed numbers yet, but we\u2019ll have all the data when we talk about that, at least, for the six-month primary endpoint. Ed White : Great, fantastic. Thanks for all the information. And maybe just a far simpler question with a short answer. So with the expectations of 60 to 75 specialty field sales force, I\u2019m just wondering where you are in the hiring? Thomas Schall : We\u2019re doing, I think, a great job of the hiring. Again, we\u2019ve really got a great commercial organization, young, dynamic, quite experienced and a lot of product experience and launches under their belt. So the infrastructure at the executive team level is very much in place. And now that \u2013 now we\u2019re just bringing on accordingly and in the appropriate time, the actual sales reps and medical science liaisons to bring them in with the appropriate timing. But the whole hiring plan is totally in effect, and we\u2019re well on our way to bring in many of those people that will be involved in that field force. Ed White : Great. Thanks, Tom. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Ed. Operator : I\u2019m now showing no further questions. And I would like to turn the call back to Thomas Schall for closing remarks. Thomas Schall : Well, thank you, operator. And again, I wish to thank everyone who has been on the call today. Again, it\u2019s been a very exciting, although challenging year for many of us in the industry. But we\u2019re making good progress. I very much look forward to updating you as we execute further on these 2020 plans. And again, thank you all for your time and attention today. You may now disconnect. Bye-bye.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : My name is April, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speakers prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Okay. Thank you, April. Good afternoon, everybody. I together with several members of our leadership team that you will hear from today, would like to welcome you to our Q3 call. The format of our Q2 call was very well received, so we\u2019ll stick to keeping our prepared comments to a minimum and limit the overall duration of the call to one hour. The slides have been posted. Just a quick reminder that we use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. Bob? Robert Bradway : Okay. Thank you for joining today\u2019s call. I\u2019ll take a few moments to discuss our performance in the third quarter and then share some thoughts on the overall operating environment in a COVID context. We delivered another strong quarter, and you can see that in our revenue growth of 12%. And in addition, once again this quarter, our revenue growth exceeded expense growth, enabling us to report earnings per share growth well ahead of revenues. Putting the results in a broader context, our double-digit increase in revenues was driven by the continued volume-driven growth of many of our innovative products, the strong uptake of our high-quality biosimilars and the relative stability of our base business, which is proving resilient in the face of increased competition. We expect these three factors to be key for our long-term success. Turning to COVID-19, clearly the pandemic remains an important factor affecting performance for Amgen and for our industry. You\u2019ll recall that Amgen grew revenues by 11% in the first quarter of the year, with the first 10 weeks of performance largely unaffected by the pandemic. In the second quarter, when conditions were at their worst, revenues grew by 6%. Our performance in the third quarter reflects an encouraging recovery from the depths of the pandemic and was largely consistent with what we anticipated for you in our remarks at the time of our second quarter call. As regards to the fourth quarter, we see the current resurgence in cases as a potential headwind for our business, and we are closely monitoring this to see what the impact may be for the rest of the year and if there might be any spillover into 2021. We don\u2019t expect anything like what we saw earlier in the year, as global healthcare systems know much more about how to treat COVID-19 and are better prepared to do so than they were earlier in the year. However, on the margin, we\u2019re not ruling out that there will be some impact and we tried to incorporate this into our planning assumptions for the fourth quarter and into the beginning of next year. Overall, I remain optimistic that innovation from the biopharma industry will break the back of this pandemic, with vaccines, antibodies and other therapeutics that are being developed with unprecedented speed and collaboration. One thing this pandemic has exposed is the importance of innovation, and that of course is at the core of our strategy and it\u2019s reflected in the first-in-class molecules that are advancing rapidly in our pipeline. We are pleased, of course, with the Phase II results of our first-in-class molecule sotorasib and we expect to see topline Phase III data for tezepelumab, a potential first-in-class treatment for severe asthma by year-end. We are also making good progress with several of our half-life extended BiTE molecules particularly in solid tumors like prostate and small-cell lung cancer. All the work that we do is taking place at a time when more is expected of companies than ever before. We understand these expectations and are committed to good corporate citizenship and sustainable operations. Before I turn things over to the rest of the team, let me thank our staff members around the world for their unwavering commitment to serving patients during this challenging time. Their resilience, creativity and ability to execute give me great confidence in our long-term future. Dave? David Reese : Thanks Bob. I\u2019ll begin with sotorasib, our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor. Based on the data we have accumulated and the evolution of the field, we are extremely optimistic about the potential of sotorasib and will continue to aggressively advance the development program. Earlier this month, we reported positive topline results from our Phase II monotherapy study in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, demonstrating an objective response rate consistent with our Phase I data at 960 milligrams and promising results on other measures of efficacy, including duration of response, with more than half of the responders still on treatment at the data cutoff. Safety and tolerability were similar to previously reported data for this population and have been remarkably consistent across the 160 patients treated with our Phase II dose. Our Phase I and Phase II data are based on protocol specified intent to treat criteria as is our practice and the scans to assess efficacy parameters in Phase II have been evaluated by independent central review. We look forward to presenting the Phase II results at the World Congress on Lung Cancer taking place in January. We also reviewed with interest a data presentation made a few days ago. Based on our assessment of available efficacy and safety data, including durability measures, we remain extremely confident in our molecule. To date, we have treated over 550 patients with sotorasib and we are looking forward to discussions with the FDA and other regulatory agencies to determine the best path forward as monotherapy in patients with advanced lung cancer. We couldn\u2019t be more enthusiastic about our position as we move towards establishing sotorasib as a KRAS G12C foundational therapy. We also remain optimistic about our BiTE platform. We now have evidence of clinical activity in solid tumors, including recently presented prostate cancer data from AMG 160 which targets prostate specific membrane antigen. The benefit risk profile AMG 160 has continued to improve with additional dose optimization. AMG 757 is our half-life extended BiTE targeting DLL3, which is a very attractive target due to its differential expression in small-cell lung cancers, and we look forward to presenting initial data at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting next month. Small-cell lung cancer is a large unmet medical need globally and yet treatment options have not advanced significantly in decades. We will also investigate AMG 757 for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. We expect to present data from AMG 701 targeting BCMA for multiple myeloma later in the year as well. And before leaving the BiTE platform, I wanted to mention a Phase II publication in the New England Journal of Medicine that reported deep responses and a tolerable safety profile for dasatinib induction followed by BLINCYTO consolidation in adults with Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL. 60% of patients achieved a molecular response and disease free survival was 88% at 18 months, highlighting the potential of a chemotherapy free regimen. If these results are confirmed in larger trials, this could lead to a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of this disease. In cardiovascular disease, we recently released the topline results from our omecamtiv mecarbil Phase III outcome study and the results will be presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in November. In inflammation, along with AstraZeneca, we look forward to the topline results of the pivotal Tezepelumab Phase III study, Navigator, in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, which remains on track. We also expect the results from the oral corticosteroid sparing Phase III study source by the end of the year, which should complement the pivotal data. I\u2019m happy to announce that we will be advancing our third inflammation program into Phase II development next year with AMG 592, now named Efavaleukin alfa or IL-2 mutein for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. The trial was selected for inclusion in the FDA\u2019s complex innovative trial designs pilot program, which supports the development and regulatory review of novel clinical trial designs for new therapies. In closing, I would like to thank all of the Amgen teams for executing at such a high level during the ongoing pandemic. Murdo? Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Dave. We\u2019ve seen volumes continue to improve from the initial stages of the pandemic, with Q3 global revenues growing 12% year-over-year driven by 18% volume growth. During Q3, physician-patient interactions increased to near pre-COVID levels. Across the industry in the U.S., total prescriptions are still down approximately 2% and physician visits, either in person or remote are down approximately 10% versus the pre-COVID baseline. While trends improved during the quarter, we are seeing infection rates rise in many parts of the world, which may bring additional quarter-to-quarter variability. Let me spend a few minutes to discuss our Q3 performance and outline our expectations for the remainder of 2020. In bone health, our efforts are focused on ensuring patient continuity. We grew Prolia volume by 10% year-over-year, even though osteoporosis diagnosis rates have returned to just 70% of pre-COVID levels in the U.S. COVID has also resulted in a change in historical quarterly trends for Prolia. Prior to the pandemic, the first and third quarters each year had lower sales than the second and fourth quarters. However, given the impact of the pandemic in the second quarter and the six-month dosing regimen of Prolia, we would expect year-over-year growth rates in the fourth quarter to be lower than pre-COVID growth trends. With the current rise in COVID infection rates in the U.S. and Europe, there could be additional delays in patients receiving their Prolia treatment in Q4. EVENITY sales in the U.S. grew quarter-over-quarter driven by 30% volume growth. This growth was offset by lower sales in Japan, which were partially related to timing of purchases by our partner Astellas. We believe EVENITY\u2019s unique bone-building abilities will continue to drive growth in our business as physicians appreciate its benefit risk profile in treating their post fracture patients. Repatha sales increased 22% year-over-year, driven by 60% volume growth and is the segment leader globally. We remain confident in our ability to grow Repatha, and given the significant unmet medical need in treating high risk cardiovascular patients, our comprehensive patient payor coverage, the convenient self-administration and the established outcomes data in the label. Moving on to Parsabiv, which is an attractive treatment for secondary HPT, supported by the convenience of its IV administration. In January 2021, reimbursement for Parsabiv will move into the dialysis bundle payment system. We\u2019ve already begun to see some negative impact on Parsabiv utilization in the U.S., and we would expect this impact to continue in Q4. Transitioning to our Inflammation portfolio, total prescriptions for Otezla in the U.S. grew 11% year-over-year. Underlying volume trends remained strong. Sales were negatively impacted by lower inventory levels versus last year. We\u2019re confident that Otezla will continue its double-digit year-over-year volume growth based on its well-established safety and efficacy profile, convenient oral dosage, broad payor coverage and the lack of lab monitoring requirements. Enbrel remains the cornerstone of our Inflammation franchise and we continue to invest in Enbrel, along with our broader inflammation portfolio including Otezla, AMGEVITA and recently launched AVSOLA. Enbrel was impacted by slowing growth in rheumatology prescribing in Q3 related to COVID and experienced some share loss in the quarter while maintaining price stability year-on-year. Continued softness in rheumatology prescribing related to rising COVID infections could further impact Enbrel in the fourth quarter. Our Q3 biosimilar revenues were $480 million, supported by share growth by MVASI and KANJINTI. We\u2019ve achieved leading biosimilar shares for AMGEVITA in Europe and for MVASI and KANJINTI in the U.S. Our highly efficient operating model and full complement of patient services provide an important advantage as we face additional biosimilar competitors heading into 2021. In Oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting GCSF with 55% share of volume in the quarter. Neulasta sales decreased 22% year-over-year, driven by declines in volume and net selling price. Competitive activity in long-acting filgrastim is impacting average selling price. The most recent published average selling price for Neulasta in the U.S. declined 19% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with our Q3 performance. We remain vigilant as the pandemic continues to create uncertainty and potential disruptions in the healthcare marketplace. Amgen employees around the world are focused on ensuring continuity of care for our patients, and we will continue investing to drive growth of our innovative products, advance our geographic expansion and prepare for potential new product launches. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Peter. Peter Griffith : Thank you, Murdo. Consistent with the first half of the year, we executed effectively during the third quarter, delivering 12% revenue and 19% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. As you heard Murdo say, revenue growth was driven by volume increases of 18% consistent with our focus on volume-driven growth. Third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter, as we accelerated our investments to drive growth and advance the pipeline. Although activity levels during Q3 were still partially impacted by COVID-19, most trials continue to enroll patients. Customer-facing commercial activity levels increased and launch preparations were in process. We see activity levels increasing in the fourth quarter of the year, resulting in increased investments. We have financial flexibility with $12.4 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, and continue to generate stable free cash flow with $3.2 billion in the quarter. Additionally, our third quarter dividend was $1.60 per share, an increase of 10% over last year. Our capital allocation principles and plans remain unchanged and uninterrupted. Let me now share some thoughts on our 2020 outlook going forward. We are narrowing our revenue guidance to $25.1 billion to $25.5 billion from $25.0 billion to $25.6 billion. The range reflects the uncertainty created by the recent resurgence of COVID-19 infections globally which Bob discussed in his remarks. And as you just heard Murdo say, our products, including Prolia, for the most at-risk COVID patients are most susceptible to the accelerated rate of infection. The lower end of our range takes into account a more accelerated impact from COVID globally. We are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to $15.80 per share to $16.15 per share versus our prior guidance of $15.10 per share to $15.75 per share. We continue to believe that we could experience fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and earnings over the duration of the pandemic. As we shared during our Q2 call, we expect full-year total non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the high single-digit percentage range year-over-year on an absolute basis. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses to grow at about 20% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Now let me share a bit more detail on our non-GAAP expectations for the full-year 2020. Cost of sales as a percent of product sales will be generally consistent with 2019. We plan to increase R&D investments in the fourth quarter of the year, as clinical trial and laboratory activities continue to recover from COVID related slowdowns. SG&A spend is projected to increase due to investments in Otezla and other growth brands, geographic expansion and launch preparations. We anticipate other income and expense to be a net expense of about $1.3 billion, which includes more than $130 million of benefit from mark-to-market gains on our equity investment portfolio in Q3. We are updating non-GAAP tax rate guidance to 13% to 14%, versus prior guidance of 13.5% to 14.5%. Our expectations for share repurchases are unchanged. At the lower end of our previously disclosed range of $3 billion to $5 billion. Finally, recall that Q4 of 2020 will be comparing against a partial quarter of Otezla sales and expenses in Q4 2019. So as we approach the end of 2020, we are pleased with our progress and execution this year, including the successful integration of Otezla, collaboration with BeiGene and transition from Astellas in Japan. As is customary, we will provide full 2021 guidance on our January call. This concludes the financial update. I\u2019ll turn it back to Bob to get going on Q&A. Robert Bradway : Okay, April, why don\u2019t we open up the lines for questions and perhaps you could start us by reminding our callers of the procedures for asking a question. Operator : Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael Yee : Hey, guys. Thanks for the update. Really appreciate it. I had a question on tezepelumab, of course a really important readout coming soon and it\u2019s an important drug. Just wanted to understand David\u2019s perspective on the importance of the low eosinophil group and in the context of the overall data and how important that is to hit there and how that would change the overall profile and outlook for that drug? Thanks. David Reese : Thanks, Mike. Yes, and of course, we are greatly looking forward to that readout as well. What I can say is that the trial is very well powered to look at outcomes on the primary endpoint here as annualized exacerbation rates, the standard endpoint for asthma studies across the different subgroups, including the low eosinophil population. So we feel very comfortable that this will be a definitive test of tezepelumab across the entire range of patients with severe asthma. Arvind Sood : April, can we have the next caller, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for the update. I guess another question for Dave. Could you maybe just comment, I know you commented on your opening remarks here on G12C. I guess the question here is as we think about moving the response rate higher in terms of the combination studies that you have ongoing, what's your relative confidence around those studies either improving response rates or improving durability? And how do you think about your ability to progress them rapidly now that you have a good sense of the monotherapy activities of the compound? Thanks. David Reese : Yes. Thanks, Matt. That's certainly the combination studies are an important topic, they're moving forward quite briskly. We have I think seven cohorts open now, three or four more are coming very soon. So we feel we are testing in a range of indications. The biologically plausible and clinically relevant combinations will have data next year on a number of these. And to your point, the goal always in combination therapy beyond monotherapy is to enhance efficacy and potentially in terms of response rates, but also durability if you are cutting off avenues of tumor resistance or escape, and that's certainly our goal. We're very much guided by the biology here, and as you look at those cohorts that are coming up I think you'll see that that's the case. Operator : And next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Cowen. Yaron Werber : Yes. Great. Thanks for taking my question. David, I'm just going to maybe keep you on the spot on sotorasib. Some of the data or comments that we heard this week is that a competing product was well tolerated at the high dose with an EGFR inhibitor and pembro. If I remember correctly at ESMO, I think your investigator said something along the lines, and correct me if I'm wrong, that it \u2013 with your product with PD-1 there was tolerability, there was \u2013 but it was addressed with dose reduction, something along those lines. If you don't mind maybe exactly kind of correct what he said. And then secondly on tezepelumab, our understanding is that the way the study is designed, it's actually incorporating the low eosinophil dose into one of the analysis in the primary endpoint as a sub-analysis. And so if you hit that, does that mean you get a broad label? Thank you. David Reese : Yes, sure. So let me take those in order. In terms of the combinations, one thing I would caution everyone is let's not over read anything into cohorts of three or four patients, whether that's our trials or anyone else's trials. We're moving forward. We've been \u2013 what we have is a foundation of tolerability in monotherapy, which is the critical thing to build on in combinations. And I think this was put into some perspective by an editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine that accompanied the publication of our Phase 1 trial a few weeks ago and I'd refer you to that. And certainly it's very common in combination therapy development in oncology to look at all sorts of dosing and scheduling regimens, and we fully intend to do that and on priority we would intend on doing that. With regards to the analysis in tezepelumab, yes, that's correct. The analysis is powered and geared across the entire population then with also look at the low eosinophil population. So your suppositions there are correct. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Hey, congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the comments around KRAS G12C. The competing program that [featured] [ph] data over the weekend did report QT prolongation, including some cases of, grade 3, 4. Is this a class effect and have you seen any cases of QT prolongation with sotorasib? And how important is this cardiovascular safety findings in this patient population? Thank you. David Reese : Yes. Well, I can't speak to directly to others data and of course, I'll allow them to do that. I will say that we've, as I mentioned, treated over 550 patients. There is no evidence whatsoever of a QT signal to date and we remain quite pleased with the overall tolerability of sotorasib. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe I was just wondering if, as you think about capital allocation, if the Omecamtiv setback maybe changes anything on that front, particularly, how you think about the cardiology opportunity for the company. And then a question for Peter, I was just wondering if you could give us a preliminary view of 2021 expenses just relative to this year? Just wondering if you're wrapping up a number of late-stage programs now, why spend would grow next year. Thank you. Robert Bradway : Hey, Terence. This is Bob, why don't I take the first part of your question. The short answer is no. The Omecamtiv results don't change our thinking on capital allocation. We continue to look for business development opportunities and continue to look for internal programs in cardiovascular disease. As you know, we're moving rapidly with our Phase II program directed against LP(a), so we're excited to have some advanced studies going for that molecule, and we'll continue to look for ways to invest in that franchise. Cardiovascular disease as you know, the leading killer of people on the planet. We continue to think what we need in that field is more innovation, not less. So we will continue looking for that. Peter Griffith : Terence, it's Peter. Thank you for your question. A good question. As you know, we will guide on 2021 when we get to January. But I do want to just say we always intend on continuing to be a top-performing biopharma firm looking at various financial metrics, always operating margin right there. So look, we're going to remain flexible and adaptable as attractive opportunities arise, and with the underlying objective to grow our after-tax cash flows. So that's where we sit right now on expenses. We wanted to be clear on the fourth quarter and how that's going to sequence in which is really on a normal historical basis, just at the upper end of it on an OpEx basis. So with that, I'll turn it over to the next question. Operator : The next question is from the line of Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. Actually one for Murdo kind of on some of the dynamics in the Biosimilar business. So you're talking about pricing headwinds as volumes increase. Are you seeing this more in the inflammation space or this is \u2013 is this in oncology? And can you kind of provide some color as to how accounts generally I guess in the U.S. are using biosimilars? Is it more just totally forgetting the brand and going all to the biosimilar or do you see some sort of a mix? Thank you so much. Murdo Gordon : Thanks. Evan. Look, we're really pleased with what we've been able to do with our Biosimilars business in the quarter. The team has done a really nice job this year despite COVID in establishing strong penetration into the U.S. oncology market with MVASI our Avastin biosimilar and KANJINTI, our Herceptin biosimilar. I would say with respect to the dynamic in the market, a lot of people question whether or not we had an efficient functioning biosimilar market in the U.S. because I think they were over interpreting some of the early biosimilar launches. And I think what you can see now is that we have an efficient market, that when there are \u2013 when there is a clear value on the table healthcare systems, providers and payers are able to capitalize on it. And that's what's driving of course the uptake of our biosimilars. I also think that the experience we've had in defending against biosimilar erosion on products like Neulasta has positioned us well to understand how accounts are looking to purchase biosimilars. So when we launched our own, we were able to take some advantage of that. And I would say that of the accounts that have opened up biosimilar usage generally initially we thought they might be using biosimilars for new patients going forward, but we've actually seen them use our biosimilars both for new patients and switching patients who are mid-course of treatment to biosimilars as well. So I'd say that the penetration at an account level has been deeper than we originally anticipated. And I think by now there is fairly broad adoption in the U.S. at the 340B level, the non-340B level and of course within the clinics. Now that's oncology. It's a little different in inflammation depending on the biosimilar itself whether it's a \u2013 an infused biosimilar or whether it's a self-injected or self-administered biosimilar. And I think need to watch that carefully because the two are not analogous. So I would treat each business segment as its own example and not draw comparisons from one to the other. Evan Seigerman : Thank you so much. Arvind Sood : April, go ahead. April, are you there? Operator : All right. And your next question is from the lien of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Christopher Raymond : Thanks for taking the question. Yes, I was wondering if I could maybe ask on sotorasib again and take the conversation back there. So I heard, David, your commentary on hopes on the response rate in combo. But I think you guys are also working on a BID dose. And if memory serves, I think we were \u2013 maybe we were expecting to see something by year end or at least in the coming months. So I wonder if you could talk about your hopes with respect to that, potential as a monotherapy BID? And then also on the same topic, can you just confirm, does sotorasib have CNS activity? Can you give us a indication on that one? Thanks. David Reese : Yes. Thanks, Chris. Both important questions. It's standard in any new molecule as part of the clinical pharmacology program to examine different schedules. So we continue to do that with twice daily dosing. But one thing I'd urge everyone to do is kind of go back to basic pharmacokinetics here as we think about this field and what are the reasons to go to split dosing. Well there are really two reasons. One, if you need split dosing in order to achieve target coverage or two, if you need to split the dose because of tolerability issues. And with sotorasib, we're very convinced that we are getting target coverage throughout the dosing interval with our once-daily dosing, and of course we've got very nice tolerability at once daily dosing. And so that's really \u2013 this is I think basic pharmacology and pharmacokinetics and the science underlying that that has driven our clinical choices. In terms of CNS penetration, we did mention at ESMO we have a couple of patients with \u2013 one or two patients with CNS metastases who clearly had responses. So the question with small molecules or in CNS responses in general is always is that due to true penetration or because there is typically a highly disrupted blood brain barrier in that setting you almost always get some exposure to drug. The third potential explanation, which we continue to explore is that it's a secondary immune activation that could potentially trigger activity in the central nervous system. We are exploring this question explicitly in a cohort that we're just opening for patients with brain metastases. And so I think in through next year, we'll have a good sense of potential activity in the central nervous system. Thank you. Christopher Raymond : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Andrew Berens : Thank you for the question. This is Andrew on for Geoff. So I have a question regarding to tezepelumab's read outs. So if the study is successful, how might it be commercialized given the conflict that your partner has with \u2013 standout for the same indication? Thank you. Robert Bradway : Yes, thank you. I'll jump in on that one. We've obviously been very transparent with our partners on how we can commercialize tezepelumab. I have to say with the many years of experience that AstraZeneca has in this therapeutic area, we continue to believe they're outstanding partner. We've worked through all the details of commercialization. AstraZeneca will indeed be putting up dedicated resources for the promotion of tezepelumab. So think about different sales reps literally in the market promoting the two different products. We will be handling many elements of the commercial process in the U.S., for example, we'll be lead on the market access negotiations and relationships, while AstraZeneca will lead on consumer marketing and professional marketing. So I think we've really put the best of the best together here and I continue to have a lot of confidence in the emphasis that our partner is placing on this really exciting molecule, both for the launch and also just strategic lifecycle management ideas that they have as well. Andrew Berens : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Ronny Gal : Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my call. You've done really well with biosimilars. You're closing in on about $2 billion run rate from about $1 billion last year, I'm wondering about the balance for next year, you were seeing significant competition coming in on both the Avastin and Herceptin biosimilars. You're launching to yourself in rituximab and infliximab, but the dynamics seem to be potentially tougher. If we're going to think about the next 12 months, can we expect the same kind of growth rate or is this asking for too much? And then separately, Murdo, I was wondering if you can comment on Repatha outlook and how do you think about the competition with an RNA-based physician office based molecule? Murdo Gordon : Okay, thank you. Overall, I think the biosimilars business, as I said, has evolved really nicely and we've penetrated quite well. If I look at the oncology products in the U.S. running at 44% share currently on our Avastin biosimilar. I do think, as you see additional competitors come in, the average selling price will come down. So that's a reality that competition brings and it's related to my comment earlier about this being an efficient marketplace. I do think there is an appreciation though for what we've done at Amgen which is to have a very effective provider-focused commercial presence the same people that are talking to accounts about our innovative portfolio are talking to those same customers about our biosimilars. So all of our services that we normally have on an innovative product are available on biosimilars, and that includes patient services for things like reimbursement or co-pay assistance and I think that differentiates us. So I would anticipate us being able to continue to capture good volume albeit at some price erosion as we go into the new year. But as I said, we're at 44% share of the total bevacizumab market and slightly less than that of the trastuzumab market. So there's still a lot of headroom for growth. And I think on the inflammation side, the dynamics are a little bit different depending on whether it's a product like our Remicade biosimilar, Avsola or whether we're looking at a product like our Rituxan biosimilar. So I think we have to watch how we draw parallels on expectations. Overall, we made a big commitment to biosimilars. So we'll continue to advance new products through the clinic and into the market and we compete effectively across Europe and we're competing nicely so far in the U.S. Just transitioning to Repatha. Look we've done I think an excellent job of converting to an affordable price of Repatha. We've got about 80% access coverage across Medicaid and commercial and we're seeing really nice volume growth with 60% in the quarter, and I think we're also seeing some nice evolution outside of the U.S. where Repatha continues to gain share. The product \u2013 really with Repatha, we are scratching the surface of those that need this. There is a lot of high-risk coronary event patients who require more aggressive lipid lowering therapy. And in light of COVID, I actually think that Repatha is a unique solution. It's a self-administered product with excellent coverage and well demonstrated efficacy and safety profile and we have event reduction data in the label. So I think compared to a product that might require patients to travel to a physician office for administration in light of COVID, that's going to be a tougher task for another product to come in. So I feel good about where we are and I feel good about our growth prospects going forward. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow from UBS. Colin Bristow : Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. So another one on sotorasib. I'm just curious like you have more data on this asset now, what's your current thinking around the potential to advance this to early or I guess first line therapy in light of the strong data we've seen some higher agents in the G12C patients? Thanks. David Reese : Yes. Thanks, Colin. Great question. And of course as is typical in oncology development programs, you start in later lines of therapy where patients don't have much in the way of treatment options, but certainly moving into earlier lines of therapy will be part of the development program as we move forward. I would also point out that an important part of the program in later lines is the head-to-head Phase III trial against docetaxel chemotherapy. That is very important outside of the U.S. in some jurisdictions for regulatory approval, but also in many jurisdictions for our reimbursement. And so I wouldn't also overlook the potential of that. This is a global development program and that's another important piece. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal from Citibank. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one question on tezepelumab and asthma. So as the data are coming up, how important do you think is to show the benefit in low U.S. patients in case if it doesn't work, do you think you're partner may not be interested in commercializing this product given that they already have a product for high EOS patients and they may have two competing products? Thank you. David Reese : Yes. Well, let me start and then I'll hand things off to Murdo. As we discussed, the primary endpoint is powered across the entire population and also the analysis plan allows a look in the low eosinophil group. In our Phase II data, which is currently our best predictor, we showed relatively comparable efficacy regardless of eosinophil status and it certainly would be our hope that we're able to replicate that in Phase III. In terms of commercialization, let me ask Murdo to weigh in. Murdo Gordon : Yes. As I mentioned before, there is a strategic commitment here from our partners to Teze. They've been very supportive constructive and helpful as we've worked through the development plan and now we look beyond that to the commercialization and potential lifecycle management ideas and I think that there is a strong press from AstraZeneca to continue to really think about all of the patients that we can benefit with development of Teze. I would just say that there is a large market opportunity here in severe asthma. Having alternative mechanisms in the market is a good thing and I think that there's plenty of room for us to launch effectively there and I'm pretty sure that's how of our partners at AstraZeneca see it. Mohit Bansal : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoffrey Meacham : Afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Murdo, I feel like I ask this one a lot, but on Aimovig, what do you think it will take for this product to really break out? I get it, it's growing on units. But for a new product, it looks range bound. Is there a meaningful negotiation with \u2013 renegotiation with payers like you guys did with Repatha that's going to be required or what do you think it could take? Thanks. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks Geoff. Let's narrow or reframe the question. I don't think it's a payer issue. I think we've negotiated very good access for Aimovig. It's covered broadly with very little in the way of utilization management criteria. Physician requests are being filled very well. Our percentage of paid patients is very high now. We're in the high 80% range for patients. So it's not an access restriction that's reducing the uptick of the class. There are really two things. One, is obvious, it's COVID. We are down substantially in new patients per week because of COVID and a lot of migraine sufferers unfortunately are just not seeking care. And neurology as a prescribing specialty is down more than some others like cardiology recovered nicely in the quarter. Neurology is still down in terms of total prescribing. And that's the COVID impact. And then there's another I think opportunity which we're focused on and that is to have both neurologists and patients moving quicker through older, less-effective preventative agents and to try biologic CGRPs like Aimovig, and that's really where our focus is for growth. We've seen movement there and it was going well, but we've still got a lot of work to do, as you point out. But we've got a large volume of patients, over $4 million. I think we're 15% penetrated into that patient population. So there is really no doubt in my mind that it will move. I also think, by the way the oral CGRPs are helping here with the promotional effort, communication of patients, awareness building of the benefits to the category. So they're acute promotion is also helping in the preventive space. But yes, we are focused on that. I think we've done all the right things on the communications front to payers. Now we are focused on patients and patient \u2013 providers and patients. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital. Kennen MacKay : Hi, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Wondering or hoping rather that you could set the record straight for planning Omecamtiv mecarbil? Are there plans to pursue a regulatory filing for the agent and if so, what is the gating factor? Thank you. David Reese : Thanks, Kennen. I'll take that. With Omecamtiv we issued the topline results. We've got data coming out with the American Heart Association in just a couple weeks, and I think in the wake of that we will be discussing next steps. Arvind Sood : Okay. April, let\u2019s take the next question please. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I had two here, if I may. First, I know there's a lot of focus on the duration of response data as it's evolving in your Phase I and Phase II trial with KRAS. But my question is, as we think about one step out in a possible first-line setting, possibly as a PD-1 combination, we know what KEYTRUDA does as a first-line regimen on a duration of treatment and duration of response. I'm curious, what's your expectation that KEYTRUDA paired with a targeted therapy, how much improvement can we see realistically? That would be very helpful. Number one. And also on that same note, as we head into the colorectal data in the first half knowing that there were I think three out of 25 responses in colorectal previously, what are your expectations on what we need to see to be more constructive on colorectal? Thank you. David Reese : Yes. Thanks, Umer. So in terms of duration of response in and moving in earlier lines of therapy, it's very clear what the checkpoint inhibitors do. I mean typically you're going to look for 25%, 30% improvements on these sorts of efficacy measures to get into the clinically meaningful range. So as we're designing programs, those are the sorts of targets that we would generally look at. In colorectal cancer, as I've mentioned before, we fully enrolled the Phase II trial data. Next year that will inform a potential monotherapy path forward. I would want to see response rates perhaps a little better than we've observed now for monotherapy, but that'll be a discussion with folks in the field. And here, I would say there is also just a huge amount of emphasis on combination therapy to both enhance the response rate and then of course to generate duration of response. As I mentioned earlier, we've got a number of combination trials, either up and running or about to launch and some of them are directed specifically for colorectal cancer. So we're really looking forward to generating those data. But I think that's the kind of state of play right now. Umer Raffat : Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Alethia Young : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter and the progress. Can you just talk a little bit about Otezla and what you've seen in light of maybe COVID-19? Would it be an oral? And I know there\u2019s more kind of marketing, I guess on the television. Just wanted to get your outlook on price and volume over the next 12 months. Thanks. David Reese : Yes. Thanks, Alethia. So we've been pleased with Otezla. We continue see all of our integration activities of bringing that product and being smooth uneventful, largely now under the management of Amgen employees around the world. And the field force continues to really do an outstanding job of making sure dermatologists understand the benefits of Otezla in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. I think what we've seen in the quarter is a return to customer activity, largely about 90% of pre-COVID levels. The majority of those customer interactions are in the virtual realm, about 60% of those. I think overall, we're pleased with the growth in volume in the quarter. We did see some one-time events, accounting adjustments. We had a favorable accounting adjustment in 2019 in Q3 and an unfavorable accounting adjustment in Q3 this year, creating an unfavorable compare quarter-over-quarter from prior year. And we're also seeing a bit of softness in the dermatology prescribing volume year-on-year on the basis of COVID. But I think the differentiation of having an oral versus biologics versus topicals in psoriasis is really helping us hold up well, and we continue to feel confident about our double-digit growth going forward. We've also held price nicely as we go into 2021. That's a good effect of having a differentiated product. And then overall, I think as we look at sources of growth throughout the world, our international expansion plans have been going well. We secured reimbursement in Australia. Our Japanese business really is doing well and we're looking at reimbursement and market authorization in other markets. So overall, it's been a really good growth story for us and we continue to feel good about the future. And then we will wait patiently to see if we're able to secure a mild to moderate indication next year because I think that's a patient population that could really benefit from the convenience of an oral and the safety profile that we've established of Otezla versus say more potent orals or even biologics. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory Kasimov : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to follow up on Otezla and ask about your baseline assumptions for TYK2 just given the proximity of that data in psoriasis? Those results are roughly are consistent with the Phase II data that's been published. How do you think about this potentially slotting into the market and the potential impact it may or may not have on the future trajectory of Otezla? And can you remind us whether the double-digit CAGR expectation you put out there for Otezla contemplates U.S. competition? Thanks a lot. Murdo Gordon : Yes. So I'll answer your second part of your question first, Cory. The double-digit growth assumptions that we put out there did indeed assume the launch of other orals into the U.S. in a relatively similar timeframe as to what's been publicly disclosed. I think overall, as I was saying earlier, we feel really good about the position of Otezla in the market. It's a widely reimbursed product with really good market access, an affordable products from a patient perspective, a very safe product from an overall profile perspective, and I just think that new entrants into the category will not necessarily differentiate on efficacy or on safety right out of the gate. I think it's going to take some time before dermatologists who are quite frankly leery of potent biologics or other products that might have efficacy, but that might travel with some safety concerns and that's not the case with Otezla. So this familiarity with Otezla, the unique positioning of it being the first product they go to post-topical and pre-biologic, I think is going to hold up really well and we continue to invest heavily. Somebody mentioned they noticed more television advertising. We have ramped up DTC given COVID is somewhat disrupting patient behavior. And also in light of COVID, there are a lot of products in this category that require lab monitoring and Otezla doesn't. So a really good profile and I think one that will hold up well despite competition. Arvind Sood : April is getting to the top of the hour. So let's take one more question, after which, Bob will make some closing comments. Operator : And your last question will come from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Robyn Karnauskas : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. I'll stay on Otezla. So I know that the current topicals are not ideal with the side effect profile. Wondered if you could comment on the recent data for apremilast with a PASI score that looked on par with Otezla? And my specific question is more what percentage of Otezla use is with low surface involvement patients? And do you see these new topicals that are coming out potentially disruptive on a share or price basis? Thanks. David Reese : Yes, thanks, Robyn. We really see these as unique segments of the market. The topical segment doesn't necessarily compete with the oral segment and we do see - right now, we do see some low surface area usage. But I think as we look at our mild to moderate indication in the future, I think there would be more potential overlap with say - let's say more effective topicals for low surface areas and orals, but it's really - it's not impeding our ability to grow and I don't see them as overlapping sectors. I think when patients say they want the convenience of an oral, it's a very clear choice to go to Otezla. Arvind Sood : Bob, would you like to make any closing remarks? Robert Bradway : Sure, just briefly. With nine or so weeks left in the year, we're encouraged that we continue to execute well. I think you see that in the numbers and in the progress that we're making in our market shares and in our pipeline. But we know that this is a year unlike any other, so we're trying to be prudent. As we look at the balance of the year and the beginning of next year, particularly as regards to the risk posed - the risks posed by COVID-19. So appreciate you joining our call. We'll look forward to seeing you or speaking to you in the New Year. And in the meantime, Arvind and his team are here for any questions that you might have. Thank you. Arvind Sood : Thank you, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Amgen's third quarter 2020 financial results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : My name is Erica and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question and answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker\u2019s prepared remarks. [Operator Instruction] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Okay. Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to our call to review our Q4 and full year financial results for 2020. I would say, the strong execution, despite the pandemic and pipeline advancement are two themes that were pervasive. So, let\u2019s get after it. We'll stick to an efficient format of limited prepared comments or one question rule, as Erica pointed out, and the overall duration of the call to one hour. Slides have been posted. Just a quick reminder that we use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation, and some of the statements would be forward-looking. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to different materially. So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. Bob? Bob Bradway : Thank you, Arvind, and thank all of you for joining our call. I\u2019ll start today by discussing Amgen\u2019s performance in 2020, and then provide some perspective on our priorities for 2021. By any measure 2020 was a very successful year for us. Despite the disruption of COVID-19, we delivered strong sales and earnings, driven by volume growth of 15% of our products. We advanced our innovative pipeline, most notably sotorasib and tezepelumab, both of which have received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. We successfully integrated Otezla, strengthening our decades-long leadership in inflammation with a $2 billion plus product that we believe has runway for further global growth. We grew our sales outside the U.S. to more than $6 billion, delivering on long-term goals by expanding our presence in China and Japan, the successful transactions in both markets. We did all this while staying focused on the health and safety of our 24,000 employees around the world. And to all of them, I want to say thank you for a job well done. As we look to 2021, we're embracing three realities. First, COVID-19 is leading to some lasting changes in how we do business. For example, we expect to continue leveraging digital capabilities, call on customers and run clinical trials around the world with improved speed, efficiency, effectiveness. Second, we expect ongoing pressure on drug prices across the industry. We are fortunate to have products like Repatha, Prolia, Aimovig that meet the needs of millions of patients and can grow through increased penetration of the appropriate patient populations. Our industry-leading portfolio of biosimilars is also well-positioned for future.  Third is capital continues to flow into our sector. We've entered a time of intense competition where speed of execution is paramount. We've built a track record featuring quality and speed. We\u2019ve shown that with innovative first-in-class medicines like Repatha, the first approved PCSK9 inhibitor, and Aimovig, the first approved CGRP inhibitor. We showed it also with biosimilars, like MVASI and KANJINTI, the first approved biosimilars to Avastin and Herceptin, here in the U.S. And we're doing it right now with sotorasib, the first KRAS G12C inhibitor to be filed for approval just 28 months after we dosed our first patient. We expect to do it again later in the year when tezepelumab as the first TSLP inhibitor. We are excited about our pipeline and plan on increasing our R&D investment in 2021. Dave will speak in a moment about some of our promising mid-stage pipeline candidates. But since this is the time of year when I'd like to address our long-term investments, I want to focus for a moment on a couple of areas central to our early research strategy. These are areas where we are building differentiated capabilities. First, in human genetics, where we have industry-leading capabilities, we are adding to our database approximately 1 million subjects from the U.S. and the UK, or whom we will have extensive phenotypic and genotypic information. This will augment the data we already have on in excess of 1.5 million individuals. In addition, we're pioneering the use of large-scale proteomics to measure the relative levels of some 5,000 different proteins in the blood. We're excited about the insights we generate from this genomic proteomic work and expect to benefit in the selection of new drug targets and clinical trial design. There's growing interest in our industry in the area of targeted protein degradation. We believe the opportunity is broader than that, and our efforts are not just limited to degrading proteins. We're looking at degrading other biologic molecules as well. We're designing molecules to have multi-specific activity through a principle we call induced proximity. The idea is to use this platform to dramatically expand the universe of druggable targets. It's still early days in the field, but I wanted to flag it as an area where we want to emerge through time as an industry leader. All of our work is taking place at a time when more is expected of companies than ever before. Amgen is advancing an ambitious ESG agenda that includes providing medicines at no cost to low-income patients and funding world-class STEM education programs. With respect to the environment, we're committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2027, along with a 40% reduction in water use and the 75% reduction in waste. In summary, our success in 2020 gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver in 2021 and beyond. The world needs more innovation, not less, and we've proven ourselves ready, willing and able to provide it. I look forward to your questions a little later on in the call. Right now, let me turn over to Dave Reese, our Head of R&D. Dave Reese : Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin today with sotorasib, our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor. To-date, more than 700 patients have been treated across five continents. We are accelerating this groundbreaking program into new indications and earlier lines of therapy. A few days ago, we presented the first pivotal data for KRAS G12C inhibitor at the World Conference on Lung Cancer, where we reported on 126 patients with second line plus non-small cell lung cancer. Sotorasib drove rapid, deep, and durable responses across a broad range of mutational profiles in subgroups with poor prognoses. In a centrally adjudicated intent-to-treat analysis, the objective response rate was 37%, including three complete remissions, progression-free survival was 6.8 months and duration of response was 10 months. Importantly, sotorasib demonstrated a very tolerable and differentiated clinical profile. And based on these data, we completed regulatory submissions in the United States and EU in December. More recently, we submitted files in Canada, the UK, Brazil, and Australia with additional global submissions anticipated in the coming weeks and months, and launch preparations are well-advanced. The Phase 3 non-small cell lung cancer monotherapy study versus docetaxel continues to advance nicely as do our 10 combination cohorts and Phase 2 colorectal study with data expected from these latter two, beginning in the first half of this year. We will initiate a Phase 2 study in first line non-small cell lung cancer in the second quarter, where we will investigate sotorasib monotherapy in patients most likely to benefit, based on tumor profiling. For example, those tumors harboring STK11 mutations. Finally, we recently cleared the safety hurdle at the full sotorasib dose in our MEK inhibitor combination study and have completed enrollment in an expansion cohort. In inflammation, along with our partner, AstraZeneca, we look forward to presenting the results from the Phase 3 NAVIGATOR study at the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology Virtual Annual Meeting, also known as AAAAI, at the end of February. You may have seen the abstract posting yesterday, with results from the primary and key secondary endpoints data that in our view, provide a compelling rationale for the potential utility of tezepelumab in a broad population of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, including those with low eosinophil counts where we have breakthrough therapy designation in the United States. We are working closely with AstraZeneca on our U.S. and EU filing packages, which we expect to submit in the first half. Turning to our BiTE platform, we are particularly excited about the rapid progress we are making with two solid tumor programs, AMG 160, targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen, or PSMA, for castrate-resistant prostate cancer; and AMG 757, targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. AMG 160 is currently in dose expansion, and we expect to advance AMG 757 into dose expansion in the coming months. We are quite pleased with the clinical profiles we are seeing with both of these molecules. And, as you will see in our press release, we also continue to actively prioritize our oncology portfolio. In migraine, Aimovig continues to demonstrate important benefits for patients as our colleagues at Novartis announced positive Phase 4 results, showing superior efficacy and safety of Aimovig over topiramate in the migraine prevention setting. Finally, our biosimilars portfolio continues to advance, and we have completed enrollment in our Phase 3 study of ABP 959, our biosimilar SOLIRIS. In closing, I'd like to thank our staff for their ongoing efforts to deliver our portfolio for patients. Murdo? Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Dave. 2020 product sales grew 9% year-over-year, driven by 15% volume growth, with roughly equal growth rates in the U.S. and internationally. Starting with our innovative portfolio, Prolia grew year-over-year, despite significant impacts from the pandemic. And EVENITY sales increased 85% year-over-year, driven by strong volume growth. Repatha is now annualizing at over $1 billion in revenues with 67% year-over-year volume growth. In the first full year since acquisition, we've seamlessly integrated Otezla, growing total prescriptions by 13% year-over-year. And finally, our biosimilars portfolio totaled $1.7 billion in sales. Moving to fourth quarter performance. Product sales grew 8% year-over-year, driven by 13% volume growth. In our bone franchise, we remained focused on ensuring patient continuity. By year-end, osteoporosis diagnoses reached approximately 80% of pre-COVID levels, leading to a positive trend in new patient starts, entering 2021. In Q4, Prolia's repeat patient numbers were lower than historical trends, as a result of the echo effect of COVID disruption in Q2. EVENITY sales grew quarter-over-quarter. We believe EVENITY's unique bone building profile will continue to drive growth in our franchise as physicians appreciate its benefit risk profile for treating their high-risk post fracture patients. In cardiovascular, Repatha remains the global PCSK9 leader. Net sales in Q4 were $253 million, driven by sequential volume growth and stable U.S. net price. As we enter 2021, we expect continued momentum for this brand globally, driven by growth from international markets, improved U.S. PBM formulary position and relatively stable net price in the U.S. Moving on to Aimovig, which is the market leader in the highly competitive CGRP class, volumes grew 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, but remained flat quarter-over-quarter as the pandemic negatively impacted new patient starts. Next to Parsabiv. Q4 sales declined 8% quarter-over-quarter in the U.S. as some customers decreased utilization, while others built inventory in advance of the January reimbursement change. With Parsabiv\u2019s inclusion in the end-stage renal disease bundle, we expect sales to decline by approximately 40% to 50% in 2021 as U.S. dialysis centers update their treatment protocols to accommodate generic forms of cinacalcet. We also expect sales in Q1 to be the lowest of the year as customers deplete $40 million of inventory build in the second half of 2020. For patients on hemodialysis, Parsabiv is the only IV-administered calcimimetic that lowers and maintains key secondary hyperthyroidism lab values. Also, Parsabiv offers providers control over calcimimetic delivery and the opportunity to reduce patient pill burden. Transitioning to our inflammation portfolio, Otezla sales were $617 million in Q4, driven by a 13% year-over-year increase in total U.S. prescriptions. We see attractive future growth opportunities through global launches, and our planned submission for the mild to moderate psoriasis indication in the U.S. in the coming weeks. With Enbrel, fourth quarter sales declined 5% year-over-year. Volumes declined from gradual share loss, coupled with slower growth in the rheumatology segment, which we attribute in part to the pandemic. For 2020, net price declined in the low single digits, and we expect volume and net price trends to persist in 2021. Enbrel has an established record of safety and efficacy, and we will continue to invest in innovative solutions to enhance the patient experience. Switching to biosimilars. Q4 sales were $541 million, driven by volume growth, which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We are leading in biosimilar share in Europe for AMGEVITA and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI, with a respective 48% and 41% average share in Q4. We recently launched our fifth biosimilar, RIABNI, a biosimilar to Rituxan. For 2021, we expect biosimilar volume growth to be partially offset by a decline in net selling prices due to increased competition. In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting GCSF with 54% share of volume in the quarter. Onpro continues to demonstrate the value of innovation, allowing patients to receive their GCSF treatment without having to return to their doctor's office or other sites of care for administration. Overall, Neulasta sales decreased 19% year-over-year, driven by declines in volume and net selling price. And the most recent published average selling price for Neulasta in the U.S. declined 28% year-over-year. Going forward, we expect the price and volume trends to persist as biosimilar competition increases. Looking ahead, we're excited about new opportunities across our business. Internationally, we recently received national reimbursement drug listing for Prolia, which will accelerate growth in China. In Japan, we're preparing for the launch of Aimovig, and we're planning for the launch of our biosimilar brands across multiple markets in 2021. Finally, our team is ready to launch sotorasib upon approval, and we're excited to establish it as a foundational therapy for patients with advanced lung cancer. And we're also preparing for the launch of tezepelumab with our partner, AstraZeneca, and are enthusiastic about the prospect of having a therapy that can help treat the 2.5 million people in the world living with severe uncontrolled asthma. Overall, I'm pleased with our Q4 and full year performance, and look forward to Amgen serving more patients in 2021. Now, I'll turn it over to Peter. Peter Griffith : Thank you, Murdo. Good afternoon and good evening, everyone. We are pleased with our strong execution and performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020. In Q4, we delivered 7% revenue and 5% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. For the full year, we delivered 9% revenue and 12% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. As Murdo mentioned, both Q4 and the full year benefited from volume-driven sales growth of 13% and 15%, respectively. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as spend accelerated to advance our innovative pipeline, drive volume growth for much of our portfolio around the globe and prepare for future launches, particularly for sotorasib and tezepelumab. Operating expense grew 7% for the full year, including a full year of Otezla-related activities and expenses. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter and the full year was $2.0 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively. Now, turning to the outlook for business for 2021 on page 37. We look forward to investing in innovation in 2021 and in launching new products. We will also continue to execute on our volume-driven growth strategy. Due to COVID, we also anticipate some uncertainty and quarter-to-quarter variability in revenue and earnings throughout 2021, with potential recovery later in the year, contingent upon the speed and effectiveness of global vaccination. Our 2021 revenue guidance is $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion, and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $16 to $17 per share. GAAP earnings per share guidance is $12.12 per share to $13.17 per share. Now, let me mention several key assumptions embedded in our guidance. First, our revenue range reflects volume growth from Prolia, Otezla Repatha, EVENITY, Aimovig, and our biosimilars portfolio, and importantly, our innovative oncology portfolio. At the same time, we expect continued competition against our filgrastim and ESA franchises, as well as accelerating erosion in U.S. Parsabiv sales, as Murdo highlighted. We experienced a 6% decline in net selling prices globally in 2020. For 2021, we again expect mid-single-digit price declines. A couple of points to recall when considering Q1 of 2021. Historically, the first quarter represents the lowest product sales quarter of the year, with planned changes, insurance reverifications and higher co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles, especially for products, including Enbrel, Otezla and Aimovig. Additionally, I want to remind everyone that in Q1 2020, Enbrel benefited from approximately $115 of favorable changes to estimated sales deductions, and the entire portfolio saw roughly $100 million in inventory build due to COVID. So, as a proportion of our full year sales, we expect Q1 2021 to be a slightly lower percentage than the 24% it was in Q1 2020. We expect other revenue to be in the range of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for the full year 2021. This includes revenues from COVID-19 antibody manufacturing and profit share agreement with Lilly, under which we expect to begin shipping in the second quarter. We expect 2021 total non-GAAP operating expenses to grow at a rate similar to the 7% 2020 non-GAAP operating expense growth, as we continue to invest in innovation, launches of new products and digitization efforts. We have created an industry-leading cost structure and expect an operating margin of roughly 50% in 2021. Cost of sales as a percent of product sales will increase to a range of 16% to 17% due to an evolving product mix, and higher royalties and profit share payments. Additionally, cost of sales will increase in connection with our manufacturing agreement with Lilly. As I mentioned previously, the revenues and profit share will be included in other revenue. Research and development expenses will increase as our pipeline advances with year-over-year increases in early and late-stage investments. And SG&A will decline, primarily due to changes in our commercial model including an increased focus on digital efforts. Now, let me take a moment to explain an update we are making to our non-GAAP policy. Effective January 2021, our non-GAAP results will no longer include fair value adjustments to equity investments. These adjustments to equity investments have historically been recorded in other income and expenses and were positive in our 2020 non-GAAP results. This change will not apply to our strategic investment in BeiGene, which is included in our non-GAAP results and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The press release contains the pro forma 2020 results by quarter under our updated policy. We will also now use updated adjusted 2020 amounts that conform to this policy for comparison purposes going forward. Under our updated non-GAAP policy that I just explained, here is our guidance for other income and expense. We anticipate non-GAAP other income expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion of expense. This 2021 guidance reflects incorporation of four quarters of BeiGene's results versus three quarters in 2020, which are recorded on a one quarter lag. Recall that we only use the limited publicly available consensus estimates for BeiGene in connection with our guidance and thus may experience additional variability depending on BeiGene's actual results. Our basis in BeiGene as of December 31, 2020, was approximately $2.9 billion, and this long-term investment is valued at approximately $6 billion today based upon the current U.S. market price. Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance is 13% to 14%, and we expect capital expenditures of approximately $900 million this year, including investments in additional manufacturing and other capacity to support our volume-driven growth strategy as well as an environmental sustainability initiatives that will enable our global operations to achieve carbon neutrality by 2027 and also in our digitization efforts to continue to scale up and integrate data and analytics in everything we do at Amgen. And finally, our capital allocation hierarchy remains unchanged. After both internal and external innovation and then investing in our capital expenditures, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders in the form of growing dividends, including the 10% increase in the first quarter of 2021 to $1.76 per share. We anticipate opportunistic share repurchases in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion, subject to our Board's authorization. So, in summary, we deliver for patients every patient every time, and for our investors in a challenging year that included the greatest public health crisis in 100 years, and the greatest economic disruption since the great depression. And we are confident in the outlook for Amgen's success in 2021 and beyond. This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call back over to Bob. Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Peter. And Erica, let me invite you to remind our callers of our process for Q&A, and let's begin the question session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question in queue is from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Alethia Young : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a solid guidance and great quarter. I just wanted maybe if you guys could talk a little bit about, obviously, the KRAS program and the combinations, and maybe perhaps kind of -- I know it is probably early Phase 1 studies, but what you're kind of looking to glean from some of these different combinations? I know you get asked a lot about this, but just kind of as we're getting closer and closer, like how you think about unpacking that with different indications? Thanks. Bob Bradway : Hi, Alethia, and thanks for the question. Yes, we do get this one quite a bit about the combinations. What I will say is there's no generic answer here. It's going to depend on line of therapy end indication, non-small cell lung cancer, of course, colorectal cancer and then some of the other indications beyond that. Typically, you're looking for a 15%, 20%, 30% increment on any given endpoint beyond standard of care, but also looking at the totality of the data. I think in many of these settings, in particular, progression-free survival and ultimately, overall survival. So, given the safety profile we've demonstrated to date, those are the sort of efficacy metrics that we'll probably take a look at. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : I bet you're going to get a lot of combo KRAS questions, so I'm just going to ask as well. The MEK expansion cohort, David, I thought it's really exciting that you've actually completed enrollment. And I know, I guess, that was mentioned at the conference as well. That could be potentially pivotal. Can you talk about whether you would actually be able to announce data on that at some point this year? It's pivotal, do you want the whole thing to be done before you report out on it? Could you have piecemeal data? And then, maybe make a comment on the SHIP2 combo as well? Bob Bradway : Yes. Thanks, Mike. No, we are very pleased with rapidity of enrollment in the MEK safety cohort. As we noted, we've moved beyond that to the expansion cohort. It's quite possible we'll have data from that over the course of this year. It will depend on just as the data come in and as we see those results. And again, it's too early to speculate on whether this could be pivotal or not. As I've mentioned, the master protocol from which these data are derived is essentially designed, so that any given arm can be blown up into a pretty rigorous Phase 2 trial. And depending on indication and line of therapy, of course, we would make any sort of decisions regarding regulatory intent in that context. So, more to come as those data unfold, but we're quite happy with what we're seeing in terms of enrollment. Michael Yee : And SHIP2? Bob Bradway : On SHIP2, it's moving along. I think biologically, that is a very interesting combination. And again, potentially more to come over the course of the year on that combination as well. Operator : Your next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Maybe just a two-part from me. Maybe for Peter. I was just wondering as you look out the sustainability of that 50% operating margin, how you think about some of the puts and takes? And then, any visibility into your biosimilar franchise, the margins there? I know, that's a question we get frequently. And then, again, a higher level, and maybe for Bob. You mentioned protein degradation is an interesting platform on the forward that you guys are spending a lot of time building out. Do you expect to do that all internally, or is that an area where you could also look externally for opportunities? Peter Griffith : Thank you. Great question on the operating margin. As you know, we don't go out on a long-term basis on that. But, you also know that we intend to continue to be a top-performing biopharma firm, when you look at any number of financial metrics and importantly, operating margin. I do want to make sure that I mention and confirm, we will remain flexible and adaptable as attractive internal and/or external investment opportunities arise. We have the underlying objective to grow our volumes and after tax cash flow. So, that's really important to us. We are committed to lean on our permanent productivity commitment. As I mentioned, we're investing in and working on digitization and automation. So, we'll continue to exercise all that muscle to make sure that we do remain an outperforming biopharma firm and operating margin. On the biosimilars, that's a fair question. We continue to see biosimilars as an extremely strong allocation of capital for us. The margins continue to be very competitive. And we're very confident in terms of allocating capital to that category, and we'll continue to do that. And we think we've got some strong expertise there. I like to quote Murdo, who says that we've played a lot of defense in biosimilars. And now, as we're on offense, we're able to have a high quality of execution level. So, good questions in that, and I'll flip it over to -- I think, to Bob. Bob Bradway : Terence, thanks for the question. As I said in my remarks, rather than calling it targeted protein degradation, we're describing it as our induced proximity platform. The intention there, as I said, is just to be clear that we think the technology that we're building can be used, not just to degrade proteins but other molecules as well. So, we're excited about it. This is -- as I said, again, in my remarks, long-term research strategy. And Dave, his team and I spent a lot of time with each other, trying to think about how to position for the long term. And in this area, will be both internal and external. I'd remind you that we acquired new evolution now two years ago for the purpose of helping to build out this set of capabilities. And I would imagine we'll continue to look, as I said, both internally and externally. Dave, feel free to jump in and add your thoughts. Dave Reese : Yes. I think that covers it pretty well, Bob. I would say that we view this multi-specificity in drugs as part of the future. Many of you know that 80% to 85% of the currently desirable targets are currently undruggable. We think this is going to be a very important technology and making many of those targets tractable. And as Bob mentioned, we are investing for the long haul, and we expect that to be a combination of both internal and external innovation. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Dave, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit more on the BiTE program and some of the, I guess, safety issues that have happened? And just what's your confidence in those programs, especially as it seems to relate to some of these extended half-life programs? Dave Reese : Yes. Thanks, Matt. Thank you for this question. I would say, overall, I feel very bullish on the BiTE program. As we mentioned, AMG 160 and AMG 757 are advancing quite rapidly. Cytokine release syndrome is clearly the single challenge that sits before the entire field. And we're making adjustments in the 701 program to handle that. I'm quite confident that we can come up with a clinically important profile for that molecule. There are many BCMA molecules in development. And of course, we'll shape our investments according to whether we can really fulfill an unmet medical need. I would say, in closing that I'm quite optimistic about the half-life extended BiTE platform, the -- a few of the positives such as AMG 673 for acute myelogenous leukemia were done on purpose because we selected the first generation molecule, which we are investigating in a minimal residual disease, setting where that technology is well suited. This was done in close concert with our investigators. Many of these choices were part of our strategy. We anticipated making these choices as part of prudent shaping of our portfolio going forward. So, overall, I feel quite good about where we are and how that platform is evolving. Operator : Your next question is from Yaron Werber with Cowen. Yaron Werber : David, I have a question for you, if you don't mind, and a quick follow-up. On sotorasib, can you give us a sense? Obviously, it's encouraging that the MEK combo, you're able to get the full dose of sotorasib. Any comments on KEYTRUDA, SHIP2 or Erbitux? And then, on tezepelumab, the late-breaker looks really good. The data in the steroid refractory was surprising. And I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s potentially trial design differences from the other biologics, just given how robust the response is otherwise. Would you consider repeating that study with a more similar trial design to the other ones? Dave Reese : Yes. Thanks for the questions. In regards to the combinations, the ones you mentioned are all actively in dose escalation, looking at either different doses or in some cases, even scheduling, depending on the agents. This is standard Phase 1b oncology drug development. I feel good about how quickly we're moving. And we'll provide guidance as we expect those data to emerge. With tezepelumab, as you mentioned, the abstract is out now. We feel the data are very strong. We feel we're competitive. With the best in the high eosinophil population and in many ways, standalone in the low eosinophil population, the steroid-sparing study. As you alluded, we think there were potentially trial design issues. And we're going through that with our investigators, anticipate presenting those data a little later this spring. And we're discussing with our partners, whether a differently designed follow-on study would be appropriate. I would point out that that trial was not necessary for filing, and we are moving ahead with all deliberate speed, as we announced with global submissions of tezepelumab, based on the current data. Operator : Your next question is from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Peter, I may have missed this, but looking to 2021 revenue guidance, can you speak at a higher level, what contribution, if any, you assume from sotorasib and tezepelumab for this year? And are there any COVID headwinds still factored in when you look at product sales, or do you assume 2021 as a more normalized demand curve all year? Peter Griffith : Thanks for the question, Geoff, and I'll invite Murdo here in just a moment to jump in on soto and teze. And look, we expect continued COVID impact throughout 2021 and revenue potential recovery in the latter part of the year contingent on the vaccination rollout, as I mentioned. So, we'll be closely monitoring that, as you can imagine. And with respect to soto and teze, let me turn that over to Murdo. And look, it's a very exciting time for us. And we've invested a lot of money getting preparing the launches for those and so forth. So, Murdo? Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Peter, and thanks for the question, Geoff. Obviously, we're quite excited about sotorasib. And I want to complement Dave and his team how fast they've moved in developing this product and also just the number of regulatory submissions they've been able to affect in a very compressed time frame. So, we are optimistic and hopeful that we'll get a fairly quick review in multiple markets around the world. And so, we would expect sotorasib to contribute to revenue. We don't give product-specific guidance, but this is a very large population of high unmet medical need. There's not a lot of choice for these advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. So, we do anticipate that there'll be a potential market with a high need there. The one caution that I'll put out is just the actual percentage of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients that have a KRAS G12C status result in their file and their medical record. Right now, we ascertain that to be at about 50%. So, we've got work to do to grow that number. And obviously, we've seen, with other targeted therapies, when you have an actionable mutation, the testing rate rises fairly rapidly. So, we would expect upon approval to be able to do that. But nonetheless, we think sotorasib will be a meaningful contribution to at least revenue in the U.S. And then teze, we'll see what the regulatory authorities do with the filing, obviously, given that we had breakthrough designation. And obviously, given the pan-eosinophilic results that we've seen, and now you guys can see the breakdown in that in the abstract. We think this is an important medicine to get to market very quickly. The last question you asked about COVID in fact, Geoff, was just -- I think, we actually anticipate COVID will have a fairly significant impact on the market, through the better part of the year, beyond the midpoint of the year. I hope we're wrong and I hope that vaccination programs will improve. But right now, we think that COVID will be with us for the majority of 2021. Operator : Your next question is from Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse. Evan Seigerman : So, I want to ask one on business development and capital allocation priorities. So, it seems like there's a growing need for more mid-stage assets, noting several pipeline pauses reported in this quarter. With 80% of free cash flows going to dividends and repurchases, how do you think about bringing in larger scale assets? And would you lever up beyond your current leverage levels, if there was an attractive opportunity? Bob Bradway : Evan, I think, we've been pretty consistent in saying that our focus is on investing in the business. So, as we said in our prepared remarks, we're planning to increase our investment in R&D this year. So, committing internally to continue to allocate capital to R&D opportunities. We'll continue to look externally. We'll look at small and larger opportunities, like licensing and business development. They're very active in the areas where we have demonstrated expertise therapeutically. And that's what our focus very likely entail opportunities that sit well with the areas that we have demonstrated expertise in. In terms of the balance sheet, rather than engage in hypothetical, we maintain a strong balance sheet so that we have strategic flexibility. And we'll consider individual opportunities as they arise. Operator : Your next question is from Dane Leone with Raymond James. Dane Leone : Congratulations on the update and outlook for 2021. So, the question for me, it focuses a bit on tezepelumab, but is a little bit different than what's been discussed previously. Allergy and asthma specifically, in this case, would be a new vertical for Amgen. How are you thinking about building out that vertical around expected commercial launch of tezepelumab, but also thinking about other indications or assets behind that internally or externally that you could point to, to make it more of a broader vertical going forward. In that same vein, maybe touch a little bit more on oncology. Obviously, in the solid tumor space, it hasn't been an area that you've been heavily invested in historically, but obviously, it was sotorasib approval coming in the first half this year. You're kind of resting on the BiTE program behind that. Are there other assets outside the BiTE program that you could highlight internally that might expand your presence there, and/or should we be thinking about something more differentiated that you might do externally around the solid tumor space? Bob Bradway : There is a lot there, Dan, in your question. Murdo and I will just double team you. But, very quickly, let me remind you what we pointed out when we entered into a partnership with AstraZeneca in particular, around the respiratory opportunity, which was that just as you point out, is a new area for us. We felt that we could deliver more for our shareholders and more for patients by collaborating with a group that had demonstrated an expertise in respiratory medicine. And so, we chose to partner with AstraZeneca, and we're pleased with that collaboration and look forward to taking the molecule to market with them. And I would just point out that we came to this through our commitment to anti-inflammation and have decades of experience in the biology of information that we've been able to capitalize on with this program and hopefully others over time. But Murdo, jump in and in particular, share your thoughts also on the solid tumor question. Murdo Gordon : Yes, sure. Thanks, Bob. We are building out our teams as we speak. And Amgen will help commercialize tezepelumab in the Americas region. So, U.S. and Canada, we will be focused on allergists, while AstraZeneca will play a broader role beyond just allergists, including the respiratory specialties. So, this is -- as you mentioned, it's a new area, but it's not that different from what we've done, as Bob mentioned, in other inflammatory disease processes. The other thing that's worth mentioning is we'll be taking a leading role in establishing access for tezepelumab with payers. And again, our extensive biologics contracting experience in Part D and the government programs will help us secure broad access for tezepelumab for a broad range of patients. As you saw, we have a nice product profile here that will benefit a lot of patients regardless of their eosinophilic status. And then, Dave Reese's team is obviously building out medical capabilities for the same customer-facing group. So, we're excited about it. It's a focused effort. The beauty of focusing on allergists is they're very productive prescribers, but they're a relatively small audience size. So, we'll be quite focused on addressing that. When it comes to kind of how we're looking at our oncology portfolio, we've got a very strong base right now in oncology between our hematology business, our solid tumor therapeutics that we have now our overall biosimilar portfolio and our supportive care. Basically one in five oncology patients today receives an Amgen therapy. And so, bringing sotorasib into that mix and then the potential of AMG 160 and 757 and 701, I think, is a fairly action-packed next few years in oncology that we can build on the current strength that we have, and we're excited about that. I'm always asking Dave Reese to deliver more, and I know his team have a lot of other earlier assets to put into the clinic. I'll turn it over to Dave for additional comments. Dave Reese : Exactly. We've got a couple of gastric cancer BiTEs, of course, also a solid tumor indication. And we've got some other molecules in late preclinical. We're just entering the clinic that will target solid tumor indications. More on those, as we're ready to speak about them going along. So, I think it's going to be quite a broad portfolio. Operator : Your next question is from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Robyn Karnauskas : So, I have a question for Murdo. I was just looking at the MVASI strength and the KANJINTI decline, and the Neulasta price decline was significant. Putting all these trends together, can you just help us think now what you think of how to model the tail for biosimilars? And if there's differences between some of your oncology drugs like the strength of MVASI is really impressive versus the decline of Neulasta, just give a sense of how we should think about that and help us model that. Thank you. Bob Bradway : Thanks for the question, Robyn. And as we look at 2021, I would say that the majority of our growth will come from additional international launches of our biosimilar portfolio. And obviously, some additional revenue from AVSOLA and RIABNI, two relatively recent biosimilar launches in the U.S. Specifically, if you think about MVASI and KANJINTI, they are a little bit different. And the differences are twofold. There's more than that ballistic to the two major ones. Bevacizumab as a molecule is actually growing, whereas trastuzumab as a molecule is flat to declining. So, one thing that we're seeing in MVASI is actually the number of cycles of bevacizumab overall is growing. And so, even holding share in that molecule actually holds up quite well. We also have less competition. That's the other factor. So there's less competition for now in the bevacizumab molecule, whereas with trastuzumab, we have more competitors. And so, I think going forward, you would see competitive dynamics shaping those two brands a little bit differently. Operator : Your next question is from Mohit Bansal with Citigroup. Mohit Bansal : Congrats on all the progress. Maybe one question on EVENITY. It seems like you have been able to grow this product, not just U.S., globally as well. And this has been a difficult market historically. So, could you please help us characterize the growth in terms of whether you are taking share from existing anabolics or you're expanding the market? And then, do you expect any challenge when the [Technical Difficulty] comes to market of this product. Bob Bradway : Yes. I was picking up a little bit of static. So, I think the question's on EVENITY. The first part of the question I understood was how are we sourcing our EVENITY growth? Is it from existing anabolic patients, or are we expanding and treating new patients? I didn't catch the second part of the question, but let me address the first part. Overall, we're pleased with how EVENITY has evolved. We've got nice evolution in our Japan business. In Japan, it's obviously -- we've been in the market a little bit longer. So, one thing that we're seeing with EVENITY is patients are on the product for a 12-month duration of treatment. And so, you have to replenish those new patients. You do have to source those new patients. And so, I think the team in Japan is quite experienced now at sourcing new patients and not necessarily where we got our early growth was from which was switching from other anabolics. And there are -- unfortunately, there are a lot of aging patients in these markets where osteoporosis goes unchecked and patients suffer fractures and these high-risk patients need a solid bone builder, like EVENITY to be able to improve their clinical outcomes. So, I think in Japan, we're sourcing now more de novo growth than we were perhaps 6 to 12 months ago. Whereas in the U.S., it's much more of a mix of de novo and switch. The other thing that's helping us in the U.S. is, of course, having both Prolia and EVENITY for the customer. A lot of the time when a patient will come in and have a fracture despite their Prolia treatment, they're a really good candidate for EVENITY. So, we're often getting patients on both treatments. And sometimes after the 12 months of EVENITY treatment are up, they'll roll back on to Prolia. So, it's a nice franchise to have and have both an anti-resort and a bone-building agent for our customers. So, I think, the future growth looks very good. Obviously, our partners at UCB are just getting going in Europe as they establish reimbursement for the product. But, I'm quite excited about what EVENITY could become for bone building for these very high-risk post-fracture patients. Operator : Your next question is from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Murdo, you recently mentioned 25,000 as the target population for KRAS. And that sounded rather irony, at least for U.S. So, I was curious, A, whether that was for U.S.-only or worldwide? And B, if you were assuming a -- around 14% prevalence rate for G12C and whether you are doing this analysis only for this math? Thank you so much. Murdo Gordon : Thanks for the question, Umer. The 25,000 was a U.S. number. We actually estimate the non-small cell lung cancer incidents globally at 120,000 patients. Now, obviously, there's some reduction from first-line to second-line in lung cancer because unfortunately, we lose patients in frontline. The second line and beyond is obviously our target population at launch. And we assume a 13% incidence of KRAS G12C in the broad non-small cell lung cancer patient population. Umer Raffat : Right. So Murdo, if we just go down that track, 13% at 120K. I was just confused, the 25K? Murdo Gordon : Yes. So that's a U.S.-only number for incidence of non-small cell lung cancer that have progressed into second line and beyond. Operator : Your next question is from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets. Kennen MacKay : Maybe for Dave, maybe it's the BiTEs that you spoke to previously, but I always love asking this question. Within the early stage Phase 1 or stage 2 pipeline, what are you most excited about in 2021? What's going to be the next sotorasib? Thank you. Dave Reese : Yes, thanks. And I think we are able to just rejoin in time for that question. Again, I think in terms of the early pipeline, AMG 160 and AMG 757, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, are ones that we're really looking at. 160 has advanced into the expansion cohort. And if we continue to generate data as we have recently through a larger number of patients. That's a program that we would probably be discussing potential registration paths sooner rather than later. I think, AMG 757 is just one step behind. And that's another one that we're keeping a very close eye on. And then, in our inflammation portfolio, we've got a variety of Phase 2 assets in autoimmune indications, as we previously indicated, and those programs are ones that I'm quite interested in, as we move forward. Operator : Your next question is from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Geoffrey Porges : Murdo, a question about your commercial model. You mentioned in the prepared remarks a couple of times that you were shifting to more of a digital approach. And I'm just wondering, we've heard that there have been significant reductions in your commercial field organizations. Can you give us a sense of what the magnitude of the efficiency in headcount you're seeing on your average sales force by moving towards digital? And could you talk about how you think that might play out in a post-COVID world? Wouldn't you expect to have to ramp back up once we eliminate social distancing? Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Geoffrey, for the question. There were a couple of factors that went into our recent reorganization of our field force. One is just portfolio evolution and creating capacity for the new product launches and then reallocating from the older side of the portfolio. And depending on which region you're talking about in the world with Amgen, we're in very different stages of development. So, for example, we're placing large investments in field force in Japan and in China, even in Russia and some other markets that are emerging for us as being important growth drivers. And in the U.S. we're really paying close attention to the forces in the market beyond COVID. We're looking at potential negative net price effects and/or price reform, as Bob mentioned in his opening remarks, as being a bit of a prevailing wind here. And so, what we're doing is looking at our overall commercial model, and to your point, making it more productive and making it more efficient. So, we're largely on track with that plan. We were able to move very rapidly last year and build out our digital capabilities to an even greater extent than we had historically. We are seeing customers willing to engage in those channels. And we think some of those engagements will be persistent beyond COVID, quite frankly. And it's that persistency that we're betting on. What we haven\u2019t done is compromised the ability to have competitive share of voice in our field facing interactions, both on the medical side, both on the commercial side, in front of the customer. And so, we think we'll continue to be able to compete effectively in the categories we're in, as well as augment that with highly efficient digital channels of communication. Operator : Our next question is from Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter Gould : Congrats on sotorasib data, the impressive execution. I guess, Murdo and Bob, coming back to Otezla, at the time of the acquisition, it seems to have oriented us that the majority of the growth would come from the U.S. And I guess, your comments today seem to be teeing up really, I guess, the global nature of the growth going forward. I guess, just your level of confidence around Otezla growth in the U.S. through the mid-2025 timeframe, I guess, given the competition and what have you? Bob Bradway : Maybe I'll just take the first sense or two, and then Murdo, you can augment however you'd like. But, Carter, what I'd say is that when we acquired it, we said we felt we could achieve double-digit growth through the first several years of ownership, and we continue to feel confident in that. And that's a function of both, potential for increased label range in the U.S. as well as the opportunity to launch in international markets. But, Murdo, maybe you want to elaborate on the opportunity, the mild to moderate, severe opportunity? Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks, Bob. We do see some of the international expansion maturing now. We've got a good business for Otezla in Japan. We're pursuing registration in China, and we recently secured reimbursement in Australia. So, we're evolving the global footprint of Otezla beyond where the legacy Celgene efforts had it. So, that is one source of growth. But, as Bob mentioned, we're also pursuing in the U.S. mild to moderate approval on the basis of the positive data set we have there. And that will allow us to move Otezla into a patient population that really is still an unmet need. These are patients who have enough skin surface area that they might be seeking an alternative to messy and inconvenient topical agents. And I think Otezla can play a very important role there in helping treat those patients. We're also in making investments in Otezla by expanding the promotional footprint of the product to include primary care promotion, something that Celgene had not done historically. So, we're doing that both for the moderate to severe patient, but as well for that mild to moderate indication in anticipation of that potential approval. And the only other thing I would say is, while we are seeing a little bit of softness in psoriasis and broader rheumatology, for the category due to COVID, Otezla being an oral has held up quite well, and the execution has been strong. I also think that the established safety and efficacy profile of Otezla is highly appreciated, given recent news in the broader rheumatology category of other orals where perhaps that risk-benefit equation is different than it is where it's very strong with Otezla. So, we think we've got a good opportunity for growth. We also said when we gave that guidance that it assumed a successful competitive program from the TYK2 asset. And of course, that was confirmed today. Operator : Your next question is from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Hi. Congrats on all the progress and thank you for taking the question? Since you received breakthrough therapy designation for sotorasib in China, could you comment on how fast you could submit a filing and gain regulatory approval? And what percent of Asian non-small cell lung cancer patients have their KRAS G12C mutation, and how large is that commercial opportunity is for sotorasib in China? Thank you. Bob Bradway : Thanks, Jay. Yes. We're very pleased to get breakthrough therapy designation in China. As our filing plans move forward with our colleagues at BeiGene, we'll provide guidance about what those time lines might look like. But, it has a little bit different implications in China than it does potentially in the United States. And then, one thing that we're looking at quite carefully is the epidemiology of G12C mutations. There is a suggestion that it may be a little lower in prevalence in Asian populations, probably because they are mutually exclusive with mutations in EGFR, which are quite high in these populations, up to 40% in China and Japan, for example. So that will be an important question that we address. We've got active research collaborations now, looking at just that. And Murdo, I don't know if you want to add anything about the commercial side in China. Murdo Gordon : Yes. I think, we're obviously very excited about what we can do with the product, huge unmet medical need. We're seeing that China is an attractive market for specialty products and the fact that sotorasib is an oral makes it very accessible. So, we'll pursue commercialization of sotorasib in China, and our affiliate is very excited about that. Operator : Your next question is from Colin Bristow with UBS. Colin Bristow : Obviously, seeing the abstract data for tezepelumab, the less than 150 group looks pretty impressive. I was just curious what your level of confidence is in getting a broad label in light of the fact that you didn't test it for statistical significance? Is that something you've discussed with the FDA previously? And I'll keep it short. Bob Bradway : Yes. Thanks, Colin. This is a question we get frequently. We demonstrated efficacy in -- across a broad range of patients regardless of eosinophil count. I think that's what clinicians will pay attention to. We'll provide guidance as regulatory discussions proceed. I think, it's too early, of course, prior to submitting to debate what a potential label would look like. But, our view is that overall these are very, very strong data pointing to a differentiated product. And I think this is just going to be a really important medicine for patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. Operator : Your next question is from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny Gal : Just about biosimilars. You spiked my head a little bit talking about increased competition pressure. Is the anticipation that in 2021 the price decrease in oncology will exit that 10%, 15% decline rate? Is there any reason to expect it? Are the payers coming in and making changes, or is this just an issue of you would cite the market, it's going to be hard to get 100%. Bob Bradway : Yes. Ronny, I think you definitely see a diminishing rate of return or gain in terms of volume share. You see that in the shape of our uptake curves for both our oncology biosimilars in the U.S. I think that the way, of course, these products are used, they're largely used in the community setting, about 80% of the usage of both bevacizumab and trastuzumab in a community oncology setting. And those businesses tend to contract on a network by network basis. And by now, most of those contracts are set in motion. There's still some incremental opportunity to add to our overall revenue base. But yes, I think the gains on volume will be incremental. And then, price trends, as I mentioned in my scripted remarks, will continue to evolve the way we've seen them. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim Securities. Michael Schmidt : I thought it was interesting to hear about some of the early stage R&D efforts and the comments that were made around the induced proximity platform. Along those lines, I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more insight into progress that may have been made within your human genetics initiative, and when or how this initiative may translate into new pipeline products? Thanks so much. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks, Michael. In human genetics, as Bob mentioned and as we previously announced, we have collaborations with Intermountain Health and UK Biobank that will add up to 1 million participants. We think we'll have the largest database on earth as these projects move towards completion. And we have broadened our focus on human data to include other omic technologies such as transcriptomics and proteomics really in the belief that in the long term, it will be human data such as these that are most important for drug discovery and development. At the current time, a majority of our non-oncology portfolio assets have genetic support that's either primary or secondary. And we expect over time that, that percentage will simply increase because there's now clear evidence that targets for which there's genetic validation and programs based on them have a higher rate of success. So, more to come. But we firmly believe that the era of human data is upon us, and we believe our collection of capabilities is almost unique in the industry. And we intend to push that forward. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Salim Syed with Mizuho Securities. Salim Syed : Just one from me strategically, high level here, guys. When you think about Amgen here, is it a correct interpretation to say that the interest in hemonc has gone significantly down and the interest in solid tumors has gone significantly up? And just curious if Kyprolis has anything to do with that, if that's the correct interpretation? Murdo Gordon : I don't think it is, Salim, but I invite Dave to... Dave Reese : Yes. So, Salim, yes. Kyprolis, I think, has nothing to do with that. What you're seeing is the natural evolution of a portfolio based on emerging data, and we will expect that to be shaped going forward, based on emerging data, of course. And some of the changes we announced today our strategic choices that we had teed up that we anticipated making. And we think it's a prudent portfolio management to make those choices. Let me call out the MCL-1 programs in particular, where we have elected to move forward with the IV formulation. Again, we had anticipated we would choose among those molecules. And given our ability to more precisely control exposures and achieve a therapeutic window, in collaboration with our investigators, we made that decision, and we're moving through dose escalation after reinitiation of that program. So, no specific conscious choices, based on hematology versus solid tumors and more shaping to come as data emerges. Peter Griffith : Salim, I would just jump in and say, we had a strong quarter on Kyprolis in the fourth quarter, given the approval of CANDOR and our first full quarter promoting it. And we expect to be able to do a nice job of making hemonc specialists around the world aware of those data in combination with daratumumab. So, more growth to come on Kyprolis, and it's a good story now. Operator : Your final question is from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Unidentified Analyst : This is Andrew Galler [ph] on for Tim. Thanks for taking my question. Just thinking about sotorasib in Europe. Given EMA typically has a higher threshold for approval for single arm studies, can you describe your degree of confidence you'll be able to get approved on this 37% response rate in 10-month DOR? Bob Bradway : Yes, sure. Let me take that question. We filed in the EU, obviously, we've got ongoing discussions. We'll provide guidance at the appropriate time. We don't speculate on likely timelines or probabilities in terms of regulatory approvals. But, I think, it is fair to say that regulators around the world do recognize the large unmet medical need in patients with G12C mutations after first-line therapy, and that certainly will be the focus of discussion going forward. Arvind Sood : Well, thank you. Again, apologies for the fact that we went about 12 minutes over tonight, but we did want to get to all of your questions. So, thank you for your interest and your support of the Company. And we look forward to seeing you or being back together with you after the end of the first quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Amgen's fourth quarter 2020 financial results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : My name is Erica and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen\u2019s First Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker\u2019s prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Erica, thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to our Q1 call. I think the 2 key themes for this quarter are continued focus on volume-driven growth and pipeline advancement. Lots to cover, but we\u2019ll do our best to stick an efficient format of limited prepared comments and addressing your one best question. So slides have been posted. Just a quick reminder, that we\u2019ll use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation. And some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to different materially. So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. Bob? Robert Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. We had a busy start to 2021 and a first quarter that\u2019s something of a mirror image to what we experienced a year ago. Last year, if you recall, we came out of the gate with a very strong January and February, and then started to really feel the impact of the pandemic in March. This year, especially in the U.S. it was almost the reverse. We felt the impact of the pandemic in January and February, and we began to see a recovery in March, a trend that seems to be holding in April as well. Setting aside the pandemic, we executed effectively in the first quarter and this is reflected in the strong competitive performance of our brands globally. Our strong biosimilar is showing the rapid progress of our lead pipeline molecules and the addition of an attractive Phase-3-ready molecule in oncology. Altogether, we remain confident in our full year outlook. We\u2019re fortunate to have a diverse portfolio of newer products that continue to show strong volume growth. Repatha, for example, delivered 36% volume growth in the first quarter. It remains the clear leader of the PCSK9 market globally, and will soon reach the milestone of 1 million patients served. We\u2019re also the global leader in bone health with Prolia and of Evenity generating double-digit volume in the quarter. Our industry-leading portfolio of biosimilars is annualizing above the $2 billion mark. And I would remind you that we have 3 additional biosimilars in Phase 3 development and look forward to a flow of new launch opportunities for these and AMGEVITA over the next few years. As we\u2019ve shared with you many times in the past, we\u2019re active in business development, looking to complement our internally developed innovation with compelling external opportunities. And our recent acquisition of Five Prime Therapeutics is a good example of that. As you know, one of the molecules we acquired in that deal, bemarituzumab was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA as a first-line therapy for a subset of patients with gastric cancer. More than 1 million new gastric cancer cases are diagnosed annually. And the disease is particularly prevalent in the Asia Pacific region, which we\u2019ve said previously will account for approximately 25% of our growth over the next decade. Bemarituzumab is now our third late-stage clinical medicine to be granted Breakthrough Therapy status, joining sotorasib, for which the trade-name LUMAKRAS has now been provisionally approved for use in the U.S. and tezepelumab also has earned that Breakthrough Therapy distinction. With a strong balance sheet, healthy cash flows and our proven ability to integrate, we\u2019ll continue to look for external opportunities that strengthen us in our stated areas of focus. Before I turn things over to our CFO, Peter Griffith, I want to thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued commitment to serving patients around the world and delivering results for our stakeholders. I look forward to our Q&A session a little later in our call. But for now, over to you, Peter. Peter Griffith : Thank you, Bob. I would like to take a few moments to reflect on the strong fundamentals of the business and further to reaffirm our full-year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Let me first confirm our predictable consistent capital allocation hierarchy as seen in our Q1 activity. It always begins with investing in internal innovation. LUMAKRAS and tezepelumab, both internally discovered, and each granted Breakthrough Therapy designation, are excellent examples of this. We also patiently pursue external business development opportunities that clear our hurdle rate and then are consistent with our areas of therapeutic focus, in which we are confident of integrating into Amgen efficiently and effectively on a timely basis. We allocated $2 billion of our shareholders\u2019 capital to the Five Prime acquisition in the second quarter and have committed additional R&D funding to pursue other indications for the lead molecule bema. Our capital expenditures remain a high priority, including investments in our industry-leading protein manufacturing, our ESG initiatives including enabling carbon neutrality by 2027, and digitization imperatives. We continue to return capital to our shareholders. First, we paid dividends of $1.76 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from 2020. This year marks our 11th year of dividends with meaningful increases in each of those years. Second, we repurchased 3.7 million shares in the first quarter at cost of roughly $865 million. Finally, our capital allocation hierarchy always builds on our efficient capital structure, which results in an optimal weighted average cost of capital. Now, I will briefly walk through our first quarter financial results. Recall that in 2021, we are now comparing to our recast 2020 results that exclude the impact of fair value adjustments to equity investments that were historically included in non-GAAP OI&E. In Q1, revenues decreased 4%. Historically, first quarter sales have been the lowest quarter as a percentage of the full year. As we entered 2021, we knew that COVID would likely introduce some variability. And as the quarter progressed and we saw a continuing cumulative effect of COVID cases on prescribing patterns, we anticipated that Q1 would be more negatively impacted, which led us to disclose in March that it would be moderately below 2020\u2019s percentage of the full year. First quarter sales benefited from 4% volume growth. Looking back to Q1 in 2020, we recorded approximately $150 million of favorable changes to estimated sales deductions, creating a negative impact on year-over-year growth comparisons in Q1 2021. As we get underway with the second quarter, we expect there to be some continuing cumulative COVID impacts. While we expect to see improvements in the rate of recovery, that recovery will be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter increased 2% year-over-year. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 16% to 17%. Effective Q2 2021, cost of sales will increase as a percent of product sales in connection with our first shipments of antibodies to Lilly. Recall that revenue from shipments of these antibodies will be recorded in other revenues. For the full year, we expect R&D spend will increase as our innovative pipeline continues to progress, which now includes bema from the Five Prime acquisition as well as the Rodeo acquisition. And for the full year, we expect SG&A spend to decline. We continue our focus on digitization imperatives. Non-GAAP OI&E was a net $375 million expense in Q1. This is unfavorable by $79 million on a year-over-year basis, due to the recording of our portion of Beijing\u2019s loss this quarter. Recall the recognition of Beijing\u2019s results did not start until Q2 2020. The effects year-over-year of the adjustments in sales deductions, combined with the recognition of the Beijing results, totaled about $0.29 in decreased EPS on a comparison basis for Q1 2021 and explain a large portion of the 12% decline in EPS year-over-year. Now, turning to the outlook for the business for 2021, based on underlying market dynamics and our investment plan, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance with a revenue range of $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion, and a non-GAAP EPS range of $16 to $17. Important additional points to consider, as you model the remainder of 2021. We are providing more specific quarter-over-quarter guidance, given the unprecedented continuing cumulative COVID impact on the operating environment. But we do not expect to provide such guidance on an ongoing basis. We see the recovery from COVID-19 more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. And for the second quarter, we expect total revenues to grow between 7% and 10% sequentially from the first quarter. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating expenses to increase by about 7% over last year, with an operating margin of roughly 50%, which includes operating expenses for Five Prime and Rodeo. Historically, the Q2 quarter-over-quarter operating expense increase is about 10%. But in the second quarter of this year, we expect quarter-over-quarter operating expenses to increase in the mid-teens percentage range, reflecting the impact of our Lilly COVID-19 antibody manufacturing agreement. Investments for growth including the Five Prime acquisition, as well as increasing activity levels, including launch preparation. For the full year, we continue to anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be a net expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Our capital expenditures guidance remains unchanged at $900 million. And based on our confidence in the long range outlook of the business, we are raising the upper end of our share repurchase range to $5 billion for 2021 versus prior guidance of $4 billion. So our range for share repurchases in 2021 is now $3 billion to $5 billion. Additionally, we\u2019re updating our non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 13.5% to 14.5% versus prior guidance of 13% to 14%. My confidence is strong in the long-term outlook for Amgen, given the strength of the business, and the strength of our outstanding and dedicated team of 23,000-plus colleagues that deliver everyday to patients, and also deliver long-term growth to our shareholders. This concludes the financial update. I\u2019ll turn it over to Murdo. Murdo? Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Peter. First quarter product sales declined 5% year-over-year, volumes grew 4% driven by double-digit growth for a number of products, including Prolia, Repatha, MVASI, and KANJINTI. Net selling price declined 7% and the year-over-year comparison was negatively affected by 2% due to a benefit in Q1 2020 from approximately $150 million of changes to estimated sales deductions that did not reoccur to the same magnitude in Q1 of 2021. In the first quarter, the cumulative effect of the COVID pandemic on missed patient visits and diagnoses impacted our business, January and February were clearly affected by post-holiday COVID spikes, and March showed demand improvement across most brands, which has continued into April. Despite the impact of the pandemic, our teams have found solutions to address the continuity of care, stabilizing our continuing patient volume. We also saw improvement in customer facing execution throughout the quarter across all communication channels, including face-to-face and virtual activities. We expect some COVID-19 related disruptions still in the second quarter, the steady recovery thereafter. I\u2019ll now review some product details beginning with our innovative portfolio. In bone health, Prolia grew 16% year-over-year, recording over $500 million of U.S. sales in the U.S. for the first time. As a majority of osteoporosis patients in the U.S. have been vaccinated and diagnosis rates are at approximately 90% to pre-COVID-19 levels. We\u2019re confident in Prolia\u2019s continued growth in 2021. EVENITY sales increased 7% year-over-year driven by strong volume growth, given the severe impact of fractures on the lives of postmenopausal women, if entity provides an excellent therapy to build bone first, which should then be followed by treatment with Prolia. Repatha sales increased 25% year-over-year to a quarterly sales record of $286 million driven by 36% volume growth and we maintain global leadership in the PCSK9 class. Sales outside the U.S. grew by 40% driven by strong patient demand. In the U.S., we continue to see strength in new patient starts with new-to-brand prescriptions growing 54% quarter-over-quarter helped by favorable pharmacy benefit manager formulary changes. U.S. volume growth demonstrates that we\u2019ve made good progress against our strategy to provide Repatha at an affordable price to patients, particularly those with Medicare Part D coverage. This acceleration in Medicare Part D growth has increased our exposure to the so called doughnut hole, which creates some negative impact on overall net price. We remain confident in our ability to grow Repatha globally to address the significant unmet medical need in treating high risk cardiovascular patients. Next to Aimovig, which remains the market leader in the highly competitive CGRP class; Aimovig volumes grew 20% year-over-year in the first quarter with a 45% average total prescription share and 38% average new-to-brand prescription share. Year-over-year net selling price declined primarily driven by increased rebates to maintain patient access. Unfortunately, millions of patients suffering from migraine are sub-optimally treated with older, less effective therapies. Given the head-to-head data, we\u2019ve generated showing Aimovig superiority against topiramate, we\u2019re confident we can help many more patients suffering from chronic migraine. Turning to our inflammation portfolio, where Otezla has demonstrated a robust safety and efficacy profile with over 6 years of real world experience in market with more than 500,000 patients treated globally. Enbrel similarly has served millions of patients globally since 1998. Otezla sales were $476 million in the quarter. Volume growth was 9% driven primarily by 11% total prescription growth in the U.S. Otezla remains the market leading brands and systemic medication for psoriasis with an approximately 30% share of first-line treatment. However, new-to-brand prescription volume remained flat as COVID-19 continued to suppress the diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis patients. Year-over-year growth was also negatively impacted given pandemic-related inventory stocking in Q1 of 2020. Otezla has more than 90% commercial payer coverage in the U.S. without requiring a biological step, and is an affordable, safe and efficacious option for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients. We see attractive growth opportunities for Otezla as the pandemic recovery progresses. In addition, geographic expansion and the anticipated approval later this year of the mild-to-moderate psoriasis indication will contribute to future Otezla growth. In 2021, year-over-year comparisons for Enbrel are adversely impacted by $255 million of favorable estimated sales deductions that were recorded in 2020, $115 million of which were in Q1 of 2020. In the quarter, Enbrel sales decreased 20% year-over-year with declines in both unit volume and net selling price. Moving forward, we expect volume and net price trends to continue. Parsabiv sales decreased 55% year-over-year driven by 65% volume decline. With Parsabiv\u2019s inclusion in the end-stage renal disease bundled in the U.S., we have seen dialysis clinics quickly implement new treatment protocols, switching patients from Parsabiv to generic cinacalcet. Switching to biosimilars, Q1 sales were $570 million driven by strong volume growth, which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We continue to hold leading biosimilar shares in Europe from AMGEVITA and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI, where we saw average shares of 50% and 43%, respectively in Q1. For the remainder of the year, we expect biosimilar volume growth to be offset by declines in net selling price due to increased competition. Longer term growth for biosimilars will come from expansion of existing products to new markets and launches of additional biosimilar molecules, such as AMGEVITA in the U.S., and biosimilars for SOLIRIS, STELARA and EYLEA. In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long acting G-CSF with 54% share of volume in the quarter. In Q1, we surpassed 1 million patients who with the help of Onpro were able to receive their G-CSF treatment, while reducing the need to return to their doctor\u2019s office or other site of care for administration. Consistent with recent trends, Neulasta\u2019s U.S. average selling price declined 30% on a year-over-year basis, and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2021 driven by intensifying competition. XGEVA sales decreased 3% year-over-year for the first quarter, as volume growth in Asia was offset by lower net selling price in that region. U.S. unit volumes declined year-over-year driven by demand impacts in January and February, with recovery beginning in March and into April. KYPROLIS sales decreased 10% year-over-year for the first quarter as the pandemic is suppressed the number of new patients starting treatment for multiple myeloma. Moving forward, we expect promotion to drive growth in second line and beyond as a result of our launch of the combination indication of KYPROLIS and DARZALEX plus dexamethasone or DKd. The combination of KYPROLIS with Sarclisa and dexamethasone, or Isa-Kd was also approved in the quarter. As Bob mentioned, our team is ready to launch sotorasib or LUMAKRAS upon approval, and we\u2019re excited to establish it as a foundational therapy for patients with advanced lung cancer. We\u2019ve already launched our biomarker assist program, which removes access barriers to testing and helps appropriate patients with out of pocket costs. And we\u2019re also preparing for the launch of Tezepelumab with our partner AstraZeneca and are enthusiastic about the prospect of having a therapy that can help treat the more than 2.5 million people in the world living with severe uncontrolled asthma. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our Q1 execution given the pandemic-related disruption of new patient diagnoses and treatment. And we\u2019ll continue our focused execution during Q2, and are projecting recovery over the second half of the year. With that, I\u2019ll turn it to Dave. David Reese : Thanks, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll begin with 2 new programs that are strong strategic fits within our portfolio. First, we are excited to welcome our new colleagues from Five Prime Therapeutics and begin work on bemarituzumab. The integration is going well and we have hit the ground running with Phase 3 planning activities. As Bob mentioned, we received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from FDA and look forward to discussions with regulators on the development program, including Phase 3 in the near future. We\u2019ll also investigate bemarituzumab and other indications where FGFR2b may play a role, including squamous non-small cell lung cancer. And we\u2019ll have more to say on the entire development program as those plans are finalized. In inflammation, I would like to highlight our acquisition of Rodeo Therapeutics and their 15 prostaglandin dehydrogenase program, which was motivated by compelling preclinical data from Rodeo and valuable insights from deCODE. This is a nice illustration of our use of human genetic data to inform drug discovery and development. LUMAKRAS program continues to advance with several regulatory milestones in the first quarter, including global submissions for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and the priority review from FDA with a regulatory action date of August 16. We\u2019re having productive interactions with the FDA and multiple other regulatory agencies that will include Japan with today\u2019s anticipated submission, and we look forward to making LUMAKRAS available to patients as soon as possible. We\u2019re also pleased to receive Temporary Authorization for Use status in France. This designation is to promote fast access to innovative medicines before marketing authorization and conventional access, and we have received a large number of requests. In the clinical development program, we completed enrollment in the Phase 3 study versus docetaxel in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Based on the overall efficacy and safety profile of LUMAKRAS and discussions with regulators, we reduce the sample size in this study, while maintaining appropriate statistical power to assess the progression free survival primary endpoint. The timelines of the study have not changed as the primary endpoint remains event driven. Although, we have demonstrated that the 960 milligram dose is safe and efficacious in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, we continue to explore different doses and regimens as is common in oncology drug development. As part of this effort, we are initiating a new cohort to determine whether a once-daily oral dose of 240 milligrams maintains the safety and efficacy profile of the 960 milligram dose in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Should a lower dose be as safe and efficacious as 960 milligrams, it may further enhance the patient experience with one-daily LUMAKRAS. We expect the results from this study in late 2022 or early 2023, and do not expect any impact on the timelines of our ongoing priority review. We also continue to make good progress in evaluating combination regimens. Efficacy cohorts are underway for our MEK inhibitor, EGFR antibody, and oral EGFR inhibitor combinations. And we expect to present updates on these regimens at medical meetings in the second half of the year. We continue to evaluate doses and regimens to find the optimal options for patients in our other combinations, including PD-1 and SHP2. Finally, we are initiating triplet cohorts in colorectal cancer of LUMAKRAS, with standard of care chemotherapy and either an anti-EGFR or anti-VEGF antibody. In our BiTE programs, we have initiated several new studies, including new indications for AMG 160, targeting PSMA in non-small cell lung cancer, and AMG 757, targeting DLL3, now also being investigated in neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Details on these and other development programs, including small molecules can be found in our press release. Turning to tezepelumab developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca. The Phase 3 NAVIGATOR data were well received by clinicians and additional analyses will be presented at the American Thoracic Society meeting in May. We remain on track to submit regulatory filings this quarter and believe the data support tezepelumab as a first line biologic therapy for a broad population of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We are also investigating other indications with Phase 2 studies in COPD and chronic spontaneous urticaria. And most recently, a Phase 3 study for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Finally, on Otezla, we submitted a supplemental new drug application to FDA based on the Phase 3 ADVANCE study in mild to moderate psoriasis. The positive results from ADVANCE were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology or AAD meeting a few days ago. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our staff for continuing to deliver for patients. Robert Bradway : Okay, Erica, thank you. Let\u2019s turn now to Q&A. And perhaps you could remind our callers of the procedure for asking questions. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Hey, guys, thanks for the question. I had a question on Otezla, the head to head against deucravacitinib at AAD showed some pretty meaningful differentiation. I just wanted to ask from a maybe a commercial perspective, how does that dataset along with the ADVANCE data change you\u2019re thinking about, the positioning of Otezla in the marketplace with respect to psoriasis? Thank you. Robert Bradway : Murdo? Murdo Gordon : Yeah, thanks, Geoff, for the question. The first thing I would just reiterate is that we anticipated that the deucra data would indeed show what they did show. And we assumed that in the model that we put together for the transaction and we\u2019ve assumed that for the balance of this year. What I would say is that we continue to believe that Otezla is really ideally positioned in the first line pre-biologic psoriasis market. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve been on the market for 6 years now. We have in-market cumulative patient experience with over 500,000 individuals globally. We have excellent commercial and payer coverage at over 90% of covered lives. And we continue to make really good progress holding a 30% share in the market with really outstanding customer-facing capabilities. The other thing that we, of course, look at is positioning in the market and how that holds up against not just deucra, but other competitors. And we think that, we really are the first kind of option pre-biologic post-topical. And dermatologists have become very comfortable using Otezla that way. Payer coverage is consistent with that position in the market. And with the pending mild to moderate indication data, which were presented at the same AAD meeting, which were quite compelling. We expect to be able to expand our utilization of Otezla in psoriasis population, in the milder patient type. So overall, we like our position in the market. The way I see it is we still have to see how the full detailed safety data look for the TYK2 product, given that it is part of the JAK family. And it took 6 years and over 200,000 patients for us to understand the Xeljanz safety profile. So I think there is a lot still to be understood here, but not necessarily the safety and efficacy of Otezla. Geoff Meacham : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : I have a question maybe for David. You had a nice update and comments on KRAS. Maybe you could just put some context around the timing of data now for the second half, around MEK, maybe talk about what drives the timing of that and disclosure. And then the comment around 240 versus 960, I think there\u2019d be different ways to interpret that. Maybe you can make a comment about that, because I thought 960 was pretty well tolerated. It\u2019s got a good profile. So maybe make some comments on that. That will be great. Thanks, David. David Reese : Yeah, thanks, Mike, both great questions. I think our anticipation is that at meetings right into the start of the second half of the year, we\u2019ll start to see some of the cohort data that we outlined, MEK and then both EGFR antibody and small molecule inhibitor combinations. And you can probably see those come out sequentially over the second half of the year, as we accumulate data. I would say that the combination therapy programs are moving along quite rapidly. And as we mentioned, we\u2019ve opened some new triplet combination. So I feel very good about where we are in the status of combination regimens. In terms of the dose comparison study, we\u2019ve now got long-term data from both our Phase 1 trial, as well as the Phase 2 trial, updated target coverage information, pharmacokinetics, as well as of course, efficacy and safety data. And based on modeling, we wondered, could we achieve adequate target coverage at 250 and preserve potentially the same efficacy profile that we\u2019ve seen at 960 milligrams? And so, that\u2019s just the question that we\u2019re going to ask. It\u2019s quite common to continue dose exploration in oncology molecules. And I would view this as par for the course. We are very pleased with the tolerability profile. And as you pointed out, at 960 milligrams we\u2019ve had an outstanding experience. In fact, this is one of the best tolerated drugs that I\u2019ve been involved with in 30 years in oncology drug development. And that\u2019s not really what a driver is here, but can we potentially get by with efficacy at a lower 240 milligram dose and enhance patient experience? Michael Yee : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Oh, hey, thanks for taking the question. I\u2019m curious about the Phase 2 data for Olpasiran that you expect in the first half of next year. Can you just talk about what sort of signals you\u2019ll be looking for in that data, in terms of your plans to design a Phase 3 study and any potential points of differentiation from Pelacarsen? Thank you. David Reese : Yeah, thanks, Jay. And for those who may not know off the top of their heads, what Olpasiran is, this was formerly AMG 890. It\u2019s small interfering RNA, designed to lower lipoprotein(a) levels in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, where elevated LP little a may be a driver. As we noted, we completed enrollment in what\u2019s a robust Phase 2 trial that actually completed enrollment ahead of schedule. And what we\u2019ll be looking for, as we unveil those data, Jay, are first of all, longer-term follow-up, meaning sufficient long-term suppression of Lp(a) levels and our targets would be in the range of the Phase 1 data that we presented last November, at the American Heart Association meeting, and then of course, additional safety data. And of course, we are exploring different dose levels, as is pretty much standard in a program like this. And so, this would be in part for dose selection for Phase 3 going forward. We are very actively engaged already in Phase 3 planning and what the design of that sort of trial may look like. Based on the data that we\u2019ve seen to date, one of our goals may be relatively infrequent dosing, given the duration of effect that we observed in the Phase 1 trial. And that\u2019s one thing that we\u2019ll be taking a close look at, as well in Phase 2. Jay Olson : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could just comment a little more detail on the Repatha trends. It looks like we\u2019re really starting to see the product break out a little bit here and not seeing some of those first quarter gross-to-net issues that you\u2019ve sort of experienced in the past couple years. Do you think you\u2019re at a point now where you\u2019re going to get to substantial Part D penetration and also see rest of world penetration? Maybe you could just comment on your outlook there. Thanks. Murdo Gordon : Yeah, thank you, Matthew. We are pleased, obviously, with the quarter for Repatha. And, it\u2019s been a bit of a journey getting here and trying to ensure that patients have affordable access to Repatha, particularly in Medicare Part D, as you point out. I would say that we are anticipating with one exception, we are anticipating relatively stable net price for the remainder of the year. And the exception that I\u2019m pointing out is that as we expand our penetration of Medicare Part D, we will have some drag on our net price as a function of patients entering and staying in the doughnut hole for a period of time. So that\u2019s the one downside of helping patients in Medicare Part D. There is still a coverage gap in that benefit. And, of course, given the durability of treatment and the chronic nature of Repatha, they can be in that coverage gap for quite a bit. So we do have more exposure to the doughnut hole over time. But as you could tell from the first quarter, we were more than able to offset that small drag on. net price. And we anticipate that we\u2019ll continue to penetrate that patient population, given the very strong payer coverage we have there with \u2013 between commercial and Medicare, we\u2019ve got over 80% covered lives for this important product. And there are still millions of patients out there who are sub-optimally treated for their hyperlipidemia given that they\u2019re at very high risk of cardiovascular events. So \u2013 and globally, we were seeing some really strong performance in Europe and the Americas. China is doing quite well, despite not having an RDL listing. And we continue to make inroads in Japan where we are the only PCSK9 on the market. Operator : Your next question is from Yaron Werber with Cowen & Company. Yaron Werber : Great. David, if you don\u2019t mind, I just have a follow-up question as well about LUMAKRAS relating to PD-1 combo specifically. I think you\u2019ve said in the past that you haven\u2019t gotten to the MTD on both drugs, as you tested them in combination, it sounds that you\u2019re continuing to explore dose and schedule. You\u2019ve also recently talked about sequential therapy. So was just trying to say, are we actually going to get data in the second half and why are you testing sequential therapy? What are you trying to say? Thank you. David Reese : Yeah, thanks, Yaron. We\u2019re continuing to look at a variety of approaches in combination with PD-1s, whether that\u2019s in combination or sequentially. I think it\u2019s fair to say a number of small molecules, EGFR inhibitors, BRAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors had challenges combining with PD-1s. And I think there\u2019s a fair amount of work out here. We are \u2013 we\u2019ll provide updates. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll have data that\u2019s robust enough to share in the second half of the year. That\u2019s possible. But I don\u2019t want to promise that, but certainly we\u2019ll provide guidance as those different regimens move along in sequential therapy, maybe actually a preferred approach here. Operator : Your next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one follow-up on that, Dave, I was just wondering, does the 940 mg dose exploration have to do with this question on how to best combine KRAS with a PD-1? And then, my other question, I just was wondering Bob or Peter, if you could comment on the tax proposals coming out of DC and any implications for your Puerto Rico \u2013 some of the tax benefits you get out of Puerto Rico on the manufacturing side? Thank you. David Reese : Yeah. Thanks, Terence. I\u2019ll take the first part of that question. Yeah, the 240 milligram dose comparison study, doesn\u2019t have really anything to do with the combinations. Dosing as you\u2019re aware, in combination regimens in oncology, one, typically explores a range of doses, potentially of all of the members of that combination regimen, depending on what the backbone may be. But this is really a monotherapy exploration, and again, determined to see whether we can preserve efficacy at a lower dose at this lower 240 milligram dose. Robert Bradway : On the tax front, Peter, why don\u2019t you share our thoughts? Peter Griffith : I will. Terence, very good question there. And, look, I think it\u2019s premature to speculate on this. We expect the administration\u2019s proposal for the subject, I think is everybody does to \u2013 significant debate within Congress and other stakeholders. Rest assured, we\u2019re active in Washington to ensure that our position [and our tax system] [ph] should continue to be competitive, and should continue to really encourage innovation in the United States [as well heard and understood] [ph]. And we are very supportive, as you can imagine of incentives to encourage manufacturing in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. And, Terence, I would just let you know that our tax leader Jackie Crouse has much expertise in the area of Puerto Rico, not just around tax, but just overall into how the economy down there functions and so forth. So she\u2019s called upon regularly by the legislators for advice and counsel. Thanks again for the question. Operator : Your next question is from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. David, I have a 2-part question on KRAS. First, perhaps if you could just walk us through your thought process on why 240 in particular? Why not 180 or 360? And I say that in the context of having seen responses as low as 180, perhaps, you could even give us a flavor for the PK curves look like around the 240 doses above and below? And secondly, I recall back when the Phase 3 was initiated for KRAS. The powering math was really directed at OS, not PFS, even though the primary endpoints PFS. I realize the conversations with FDA have moved towards PFS, and looks like the new powering is more than reasonable for PFS. But I do want understand the evolution and thought process away from OS, and what we can reasonably expect on p-values around OS with data that Amgen? Thank you. David Reese : Yeah. Thanks, Umer. Good question. Yeah, the 240 milligram dose was chosen based on modeling that we\u2019ve done that really takes account of all of the dose levels pharmacokinetic data, target coverage data, or accumulated preclinical data regarding efficacy at different target coverage levels. And, this was really chosen as a lower bound, where we thought we would potentially preserve or could preserve the efficacy that we\u2019re seeing at 960 milligrams. In regards to the Phase 3 trial, as you note, we change the powering to really have \u2013 we have good power on the progression free survival endpoint that was done in concert with regulators. We will be able to take a look at overall survival. The power will be somewhat reduced in terms of the overall survival endpoint, but \u2013 I think, we\u2019ll still have a pretty good sense of what the drug is producing in terms of overall survival. Part of the thinking here is well is to minimize exposure of patients to the docetaxel control arm. Umer Raffat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Mohit Bansal with Citi. Mohit Bansal : Question \u2013 and maybe 1 question for Murdo. So Onpro has done really well during pandemic. Could you please remind us how often these contracts are negotiated? And should we expect any reversal in Onpro trends? Are we seeing anything there as the pandemic subsides? Thank you. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Mohit. The contracts aren\u2019t necessarily on the schedule. We have some large networks, where we negotiate annually, but we have a lot of smaller what we call value-based accounts, where we contract on a much more non-calendarized basis, so they\u2019re happening throughout the course of the year. And is your question with respect to reversal \u2013 are you asking me about price trends, volume trends? Can you clarify that question? Mohit Bansal : I mean, the trends, because there was a trend towards using more Onpro versus the PFS, given it is to taken at-home products. So do you think there could be some kind of reversal there as the pandemic subside, because then patients can come in and then get their shots? Murdo Gordon : Yeah, thank you for the clarification. Obviously, we\u2019re watching that clearly, the pandemic was stimulus for many oncologists to think more carefully about the G-CSF treatment that they were going to use in order to help minimize the amount of provider interaction that patients would incur. What we have been doing in the meantime, though, is reinforcing that you actually can improve outcomes by using long acting G-CSF. And using Onpro in particular, so we have a promotional effort that I think is helping strengthen the volume demand curve. The only thing I will continue to point out, though, is with competition comes some price erosion. And we have a new competitor entrant in that category in the long acting G-CSF category. So we anticipate more net price negative evolution through the remainder of the year. Mohit Bansal : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Geoffrey Porges : Right. Thank you very much for the question. Murdo, could you just discuss the issue of price pretty significant negative price effect? First of all, could you tell us whether that\u2019s all in the U.S. or whether it\u2019s U.S. and ex-U.S.? And then secondly, essentially, in the U.S. took significant price increases at the end of the year, but still have negative price Q-on-Q looks like 8% or 9%? Is this going to be a trend that persists throughout the year? And then, Bob, perhaps you could comment on what we should be modeling in terms of legislative or executive order changes to pricing going forward? You usually have your finger on the pulse in Washington. Thanks. Murdo Gordon : Sure. All right. Thanks, Geoff. Let me go first on the overall price evolution in the portfolio, we continue to believe that mid-single-digit net negative price for the portfolio for the years, the right number, that\u2019s what we continue to see what you know and what we experienced, probably more than some of our peer companies in the first quarter, given the nature of our portfolio is more net negative price evolution, because of patients renewing and their benefits, and going through benefit re-verification and hitting, they\u2019re kind of out of pocket recess. And so our co-pay assistance programs have more drag, we did activate more payer access at the end of last year into this. So we did have on some brands, some increased payer coverage at the cost of some net price negative evolution. But we do anticipate Q1 being the lowest compare, Q2 a little better, and then Q3 and Q4 being better thereafter. Geoffrey Porges : Great. Thank you. Robert Bradway : And, Jeff, on Washington, I\u2019m not sure whether executive orders the concern these days, or whether it\u2019s something that\u2019s attached to reconciliation, if I had to guess I\u2019d say that the greater risk of something being attached to reconciliation. But it\u2019s still not very clear how this administration and members of the Democratic Party in general, want to try to tackle the question of drug pricing this year. So we\u2019re continuing to stay very involved, as you\u2019d expect, and we have the benefit, I think of being able to demonstrate just how important innovation is with the progress you see being made against the pandemic. And so, we\u2019ll continue to stay active and focus on the things that could be done to improve patient access to medicines. And, I think the other thing, Jeff is to continue to shine a light on the role of the middlemen and how much of the pharmaceutical dollars now wind up in the hands of the middlemen, which I think now, across the country is just an excess of 50%. I think it actually is at 51% now. So we\u2019ll continue to draw attention to that as well. Geoffrey Porges : Right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Alethia Young : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted you guys talk a little bit more about the moderate-to-severe psoriasis market and how you plan on kind of penetrating with the current commercial salesforce you have, especially, in light of potential competition that may emerge over time in Bristol? And then just also with the SHIP2 program, is that still underway as a combination for you guys? Thanks. Robert Bradway : Maybe I\u2019ll just start very quickly, Alethia. SHIP2, yeah, that\u2019s underway, and we\u2019re continuing to work on that combination more to come. Murdo? Murdo Gordon : Yeah, Alethia, as I mentioned earlier in response to the question on the TYK2 data that were recently presented. As I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we have begun primary care promotion for Otezla in the currently labeled mild-to-moderate patient population, and have seen good response there in terms of uptake with 11% TRx year-on-year performance for the quarter. We\u2019re pretty pleased with that evolution, what we are seeing is a slowdown in the psoriasis patient population in the newly diagnosed patient population, in particular. We think this is a direct impact of COVID causing patients with psoriasis, not to see their dermatologist starting really at the beginning of the pandemic, but what\u2019s happened is the cumulative effect of this is starting that to impact the patients that have passed through some of the topical options. And we depend on bio-naive patients for our growth. So we are definitely pre-biologic option for dermatologists. So we are watching that closely, and we think that that could continue to create some softness in the pre-biologic psoriasis patient market opportunity into Q2 with recovery thereafter, because we are seeing much more patient volume in dermatology offices in March and into April. So we think that things are recovering. But it will take a while for that cumulative effect of new patient softness to work its way through the market. In terms of overall positioning in the market, we continue to think that our safety and efficacy profile is a very attractive option for patients and dermatologists as that first systemic agent pre-biologic, and I think really these days in rheumatology and dermatology, physicians are much more aware of the different categories of options that they have, and the different profiles of the different classes of drugs. And I think that with recent data in the JAK category, there\u2019ll be some speculation and some hesitancy to use a product like the TYK2, as a first bio-naive option for to treat patients. Robert Bradway : Hey, Erica, thanks, let\u2019s go to the next question. Operator : Your next question is from Dane Leone with Raymond James. Dane Leone : Hi, thank you for taking the questions, and congrats on the update in the start to the year. So the question for me, just as a follow-up to some of those sotorasib questions. Is really maybe since people have been asking about fairly specific things, I think, what everyone\u2019s trying to analyze and some of the updates, if we\u2019re really only getting longer-term follow-up on your pivotal dataset at ASCO is, what\u2019s the team\u2019s view right now of the ability to move sotorasib into the frontline setting and long, a lot of us had thought that you would need a successful combination with PD-1 to move in the frontline setting. Obviously, we haven\u2019t seen you guys start a pivotal dataset. And you just said, might take longer to figure out that algorithm. Alternatively, you go down the SHIP2 pathway, do you, 1 have a timeline for showing us SHIP2 combination data? And 2, is there an alternative path for getting sotorasib into the frontline long setting that we should be thinking about that we might be missing on this call right now? Thank you. Robert Bradway : Yeah, thanks, Dane. In terms of potential frontline combinations, I think a number of them that are being examined in the master protocol, if we can enhance efficacy by multiple hits on the pathway could be feasible, for example, the MEK combination. The EGFR inhibitor combinations, and then as well, as you mentioned PD-1 whether that is in combination or sequentially, for example, to rely on a priming effect is a question that we\u2019re trying to answer. SHIP2, I would also consider an additional hit on the pathway and would also fall into that grouping. So I think, we\u2019ll be guided by emerging data, but all of those would be potential avenues into earlier lines of therapy, in addition also potentially avenues into other indications such as colorectal cancer in some of the other solid tumors, where G12C mutations occur. Operator : Your next question is from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny Gal : Good afternoon. And thank you for getting me in. 2 if I may. First, just the traditional sotorasib question. I guess, we saw some data in ACR about patient having multiple escape mutations from the first \u2013 from being when treated with KRASG12C inhibitor. And I was wondering, does that concern you that that patient escapes so quickly with multiple mechanisms that suggests that maybe 2 agents will not be enough? Or is that kind of thoughts for the course, and this is what was expected. And second, we have seen some of your peers\u2019 license China developed and tested product to bring to the developed market, especially in oncology. And I was wondering if you consider this strategy, especially as the by similar player, this seems to be a natural complimentary strategy, any so where do you come from that? Robert Bradway : Maybe I\u2019ll start with the first part, and then have Murdo address the second part. Yeah, in terms of the mutational patterns that were recently reported, I would say that biologically, nothing that we thought surprised us based on everything we\u2019ve learned about these pathways in the last 30 to 40 years and the potential mechanisms of resistance. This also points the way, I think, 2 specific combinations that may, in fact, help to ameliorate those resistance patterns. I will point out that we will be presenting in short order here also updated comprehensive biomarker data including mutational data, and I think you\u2019ll find that of interest in that is certainly helping to guide our own thinking about the development program as well. Murdo, do you want to take the second half of the question? Murdo Gordon : Yes, Ronny, we continue to look globally for product opportunities to license and promote in the world. And I think in oncology, in particular, there have been some interesting deals done lately. We obviously have a strong partnership already with a company based in China through Beijing. And we continue to enjoy that partnership and the co-development that we have. I would also say that given our global footprint, Amgen really is an excellent partner choice with our global capabilities in oncology and general medicine. So we\u2019re opening to business with Chinese companies, Japanese companies, global companies, absolutely. Robert Bradway : Okay. We\u2019re pushing up against the top of the hour. So we\u2019re trying to get over questions. But are we bringing on the next caller? Operator : Okay. Our next question is from Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter Gould : Good afternoon, thanks for all the color today, maybe just switching gears a bit and moving to the DCMA sounds like you\u2019re about to go back into the clinic, can you maybe just give us some color on sort of the changes to the protocol or dose escalation and any read through to the broader platform, and just, I guess, focus more specifically on DCMA with those changes comment on sort of your competitiveness in a increasingly competitive space? Thank you. Robert Bradway : Yeah, Carter, thanks for the question. So we do expect to begin dosing again, hopefully, in the next few weeks or so. As you intuited, this would adjust some of the inter-patient dose escalation that is typical with the use of BiTE molecules, and so that we\u2019ll be pushing that forward. More broadly, obviously, we want to be able to deliver a program here that can offer something to patients, and physicians that they realize might not have, and we\u2019ll continually assess the program against that metric. More broadly, I\u2019m quite pleased with the progress we made on AMG 160 and AMG 757. And, as always \u2013 we\u2019ll always provide a cautionary note about extrapolating extensively across programs, because much of what we witness in the clinic is target dependent and so all of these programs will have their idiosyncrasies that need to be worked through as part of the development program. Operator : Your next question is from Colin Bristow with UBS Equities. Colin Bristow : Good evening. Thanks for take me in. Just a quick update from you guys on the business development priorities. What are your current areas of interest? How are you thinking about deal size? And just some overall, I guess, commentary on how you\u2019re thinking about valuations in the space? Thanks. Robert Bradway : Well, Colin, as you know, we transacted 2 acquisitions in the first quarter, 1 of the preclinical stage, 1 of the Phase 3 ready, and I think that reflects the breadth of interest that we have. We\u2019re continuing to look at acquisitions and licensing opportunities in our stated areas of focus. So, in particular, immunology the inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cancer are attracted to us. And then we have very strong franchises in the few other therapeutic areas, as you know, and in migraine and bone health and nephrology. So we look for commercial opportunities there as well. Colin Bristow : That\u2019s helpful. Maybe just 1 quick question in terms of protein degradation, obviously, you have a platform that somewhat early, you have any interest in expanding you\u2019re positioning in that space? Robert Bradway : Yeah, as we said before, I think going forward we would expect the development of what we call the induced proximity platform to depend both on internal innovation and external partnerships and potentially acquisition. So we\u2019re open to both. We\u2019re making a lot of progress there. And we\u2019ll provide more detail a bit later. Colin Bristow : Good. Thank you. Robert Bradway : Erica, I gather we have a couple more questions lined up. So we\u2019ll take those remaining questions with apologies to the audience that we\u2019re going over the allotted hour. But let\u2019s get to next question. Operator : Your next question is from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Robyn Karnauskas : Thanks, guys. So you addressed a little bit of the moderate to severe pressure on the competition for Otezla. Could you again address a little bit more, now that we have more granular data from Tapinarof and others on the topicals? Do you think the topicals being cheaper might push out some of the uptake in the biologics for Otezla? And then, if you want to answer that one, just throwing out here, you\u2019re one of the first to do RTOR application for oncology with all the FDA controversy development. Can you just tell us like, how that\u2019s going? Is it proceeding as normal? We\u2019re all wondering how that application process will go, because that could be the faster way to market for a lot of new drugs. Thanks. Robert Bradway : Let\u2019s try to get them both quickly. Murdo Gordon : All right, Robyn. Look, we think that there\u2019s obviously a role for topicals to play for patients with low body surface area involvement in their disease. When it starts to become a broader surface area or in awkward places on the patient\u2019s body, then they\u2019re looking for a systemic agent, and they\u2019re looking for a safe and effective one. And that\u2019s really where we think the mild to moderate opportunity is for Otezla. And we\u2019re not even considering the millions of patients out there with mild to moderate. We\u2019re looking at about 40% to 50% addressable patient population. So we\u2019re giving at least half the market as a topical market, assuming the other half would be addressable with an oral. Dave? David Reese : Yeah. And, in terms of RTOR or Real-Time Oncology Review, what that does is permit submission of tranches of data, as you move through the submission process, as opposed to waiting and submitting either a complete file all at once or very large chunks of a file. We\u2019ve had very productive interactions with the FDA. And in our view, the RTOR process has worked quite nicely here. In the longer term, quite frankly, I think this is the way of the future not only in oncology, but across therapeutic areas for more real-time submission of data, probably from the inception of development programs. Robert Bradway : Erica, let\u2019s take 2 last questions, please. Operator : Your next question is from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets. Kennen MacKay : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. A question on tezepelumab. We recently heard from a KOL some thoughts that this actually could be as competitive as some of the other biologics in asthma in the high eosinophil group, not just competitive in the high unmet need [levy eosinophil] [ph] market. Just wondering when that data does come out, that full publication does come out, really what we should be looking for in these high eosinophil patients for signs of competitiveness there. Thank you. Robert Bradway : Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. As we\u2019ve reported, as you saw, and we\u2019ll be providing some data updates, additional analyses on the NAVIGATOR Phase 3 trial at the American Thoracic Society meeting in a few weeks now. Across the board, we saw efficacy that we think is consistent with first line use. It\u2019s important to understand that there are many patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, who have disease that is seeking another treatment right now, meaning they are not controlled with currently available therapies. And so, regardless of eosinophil count, we think that the clinical profile of this molecule is quite attractive. And my view continues to be that this is just going to be a really important medicine in asthma for patients. Arvind Sood : Erica, let\u2019s take one last question. Operator : Your final question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory Kasimov : Updated LUMAKRAS\u2019 ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and do you see this as a potential future source of differentiation one way or the other in the KRAS field? Thank you. David Reese : Yeah, Cory, thanks. Quickly, so we are actually studying specifically LUMAKRAS in patients with brain metastases. I think the clinical data will be definitive here. And once we\u2019ve amassed a large enough dataset, we\u2019ll present that. But it\u2019s full speed ahead to answer that question. Robert Bradway : Okay. Well, thank you all for your patience and for dialing in to the call today. I remind you as always that Arvind and his team will be around for several hours still, if you had other questions that you didn\u2019t get answered. But we appreciate your support and look forward to being back with you in July. Thanks. Arvind Sood : Thank you, everybody. Operator : This concludes Amgen\u2019s First Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to make sure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Erica, thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to our Q2 call. I think the 3 key themes for this quarter are great execution in a challenging environment, pipeline advancement, and smart and strategic business development. Lots to cover, so let's jump right in. Slides are up. A quick reminder that we will use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation. And some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and hello everyone and thank you for joining our call. Through the first six months of the year, Amgen has continued to execute well, driving demand for our current products globally while also paving the way for growth from future products. Total revenues in the second quarter increased 5% over the prior year, and 11% over the prior quarter. We achieved this growth despite the lingering effects of COVID-19 and increased competition in many of our therapeutic categories.  We continue to see strong volume-driven growth from Repatha, Otezla, Prolia, and EVENITY, and a number of our oncology biosimilar -- oncology medicines as well, all of which address significant health challenges. We also saw strong growth in the quarter from our biosimilars, supporting our commitment to deliver value to healthcare systems around the world. We generated volume growth of 22% outside the United States, and we're particularly encouraged by our progress in the Asia-Pacific region, where two notable approvals in the second quarter should provide additional growth moving forward. In China, our partner BeiGenesecured approval for Kyprolis, which joins BLINCYTO and XGEVA in our oncology collaboration there. And in Japan, the approval of Aimovig for migraine marks another important milestone for us in that market. In the U.S., we're excited by the strong launch of LUMAKRAS, which is providing hope to lung cancer patients in need of new treatment options. We\u2019ve very pleased with the enthusiasm LUMAKRAS has generated in the oncology community.  We're also excited that the FDA granted priority review to Tezepelumab, further confirming our belief that it offers significant advantages over currently available treatment alternatives for people with severe asthma, a debilitating disease that affects millions worldwide. We've long sought to complement our internal innovation efforts with the best available external innovation. And in the first half of this year, we've executed on several compelling business development transactions which fits squarely in our stated areas of interest.  The acquisition of Five Prime Therapeutics and our partnership with Kyowa Kirin, for example, have added to potential first-in-class phase 3 ready assets in cancer and inflammation, two therapeutic categories where there remains a high unmet need. The acquisition of Teneobio, which Dave will address in a moment, will significantly strengthen our protein engineering capabilities across therapeutic areas. Our strong balance sheet and cash flows will enable us to take advantage of additional business development opportunities like these as they arise. All the work we do is focused on advancing our mission to serve patients and to do so in a way that helps to address the many challenges facing society. You may have seen our recently announced plans to invest approximately $1 billion to build two new manufacturing facilities, one in North Carolina and the other in Ohio, to meet the demand for our medicines. Both facilities will utilize cutting-edge technologies to be much more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional plants, supporting our goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2027.  Both plants will also draw from very diverse talent pools as we, along with a number of other large companies that are part of the OneTen coalition, look to collectively hire 1 million black Americans into well-paying jobs over the next 10 years. You can learn more about our commitment to good corporate citizenship by reading our ESG report, which can be found in the responsibility section of Amgen.com. Finally, before I turn things over to Murdo, let me thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued commitment to serving patients around the world and delivering strong performance across all aspects of our business. Murdo, over to you. Murdo Gordon : Thank you, Bob. Second-quarter product sales increased 3% year-over-year. Volumes increased 8%, driven by double-digit growth across a number of our products, including Prolia, Repatha, and our biosimilar products MVASI and KANJINTI. Our ex-U.S. business grew 18% with a volume growth of 22% year-over-year. We continued to see a gradual recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Q2 when compared to Q1 2021. Patient visits and lab test procedure trends continued to improve but remained below pre-COVID-19 levels.  We remain focused on customer execution. Overall, U.S. field activity improved quarter-over-quarter reaching 80% of pre-COVID levels. Face-to-face customer interactions are increasing and accounted for 60% of activity during the second quarter. Over the course of the pandemic, the cumulative decline in diagnoses has suppressed the volume of new patients starting treatment, which we expect will continue to impact our business during the second half of the year. Now let me review some product details beginning with our innovative portfolio. In bone health, Prolia increased 24% year-over-year, driven primarily by volume growth.  In the second quarter, osteoporosis diagnoses rates remained at approximately 90% of pre-pandemic levels. We remain focused on driving patient growth and are optimistic about Prolia's strength in the second half of the year. EVENITY sales increased 30% year-over-year, driven by 32% volume growth. In the U.S., sales nearly doubled year-over-year as we saw an acceleration in demand trends driven by new and continuing patients. We believe EVENITY 's unique bone-building attributes will continue to drive revenue growth.  Moving to Repatha, which has reached more than 1 million patients since launch. Repatha sales increased 43% year-over-year driven by 49% volume growth, and we maintained U.S. and global share leadership in the PCSK9 class. In the U.S., total volumes grew 37% year-over-year, and outside the U.S., volumes grew 66% year-over-year. Volume growth in the quarter was partially offset by lower net selling price resulting from an increase in Medicare Part D patients receiving Repatha and entering the coverage gap. Looking forward, we expect some ongoing reduction in global net selling price on a sequential basis.  Overall, we're confident in our ability to grow Repatha to help more patients at risk of developing a heart attack or a stroke. Now on to Aimovig, which grew 24% quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net sales declined 16%. Volumes grew 11% but were more than offset by lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions In the U.S., Aimovig TRx volume grew 7% year-on-year, and the brand maintained total prescription share leadership among subcutaneous CGRPs. Looking ahead, we see continued rebate pressure as oral CGRPs compete for a share in the market.  To date, more than half a million patients worldwide have been prescribed Aimovig. We believe Aimovig has significant potential to help many more patients suffering from chronic migraine given the clinical data that will be published soon, showing Aimovig\u2019s superiority versus topiramate. Moving to our inflammation portfolio, Otezla sales were $534 million in the quarter, with 5% volume growth more than offset by unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and lower net selling price. In the U.S., Otezla maintained first-line share leadership in psoriasis. New-to-brand prescription volumes grew 10% year-over-year, even as patient visits to dermatologists remained 15% below pre-pandemic levels.  The number of new patients who started treatment with Otezla in Q2 was near pre-pandemic levels, but those gains were largely offset by a lower percentage of 90-day prescription fills and lower prescription refill rates for Otezla. We expect the post pandemic recovery in the dermatology segment will progress over the coming quarters. Looking forward, we're preparing for the anticipated approval of mild-to-moderate psoriasis indication in the U.S. later this year, and for the launch of Otezla in China.  ENBREL sales decreased 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower net selling prices and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. On a year-over-year basis, volumes declined by 1% supported by ENBREL's long track record of efficacy and safety. Turning to biosimilars, Q2 sales were $567 million driven by strong volume growth, which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We continue to hold leading biosimilar shares in Europe for AMGEVITA, and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI.  For the remainder of the year, we expect worldwide biosimilar volume growth to be offset by declines in net selling price due to increased competition. Longer term, growth for biosimilars will come from expansion of existing products in new markets and launches of additional biosimilar molecules such as Amgevita in the U.S. and biosimilars Soliris, STELARA, and EYLEA. In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting GCSF with 52% volume share in the quarter. Sales declined 18% year-over-year driven by lower net selling price and lower volume.  This was partially offset by a $75 million year-over-year benefit from favorable changes in reimbursement mix. Neulasta's U.S. average selling price declined 35% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. We expect this trend will continue throughout 2021 driven by intensifying competition. KYPROLIS sales increased 11% year-over-year, primarily driven by volume growth and net selling price. Moving forward, we expect growth from KYPROLIS use in combination with CD38 antibodies, including DARZALEX and SARCLISA. I'd like to take this opportunity to comment on our recent launch of LUMAKRAS, which is off to a strong start with unaided brand awareness increasing 20 points since launch.  KRAS testing in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer now stands at 70%, and 46 of the top 50 testing labs now identify KRAS G12C as actionable in their laboratories. We're very pleased with the positive reaction from the oncology community, and we will be working closely with them to ensure access for patients who can benefit from this breakthrough medicine. Overall, I'm pleased with our Q2 execution given the sustained impact of COVID-19 on our business, closely monitor the course of the pandemic and its impact on patients and physician behavior during the second half of the year, maintain our focus on execution to ensure our medicines continue to reach the patients they can benefit. And with that, I will turn it over to Dave. David Reese : Thanks, Murdo. And good afternoon, everyone. We made several important advances in R&D last quarter. I will begin with our acquisition of Teneobio, which will strengthen Amgen's leadership in developing engineered protein-based medicines to treat patients with serious illnesses. There are three important components to the acquisition. First, Teneobio's core antibody technology will enable the development of multi-specific biologics directed against targets in a wide range of diseases across our key therapeutic areas. Tenebio's antibody platform offers capabilities complementary to our [Indiscernible].  It is genetically modified to express human IgG molecules comprising only a heavy chain, A small single-chain antigen-binding BH domains from these molecules are soluble, and stable, and can be easily strung together like beads on a string to generate multispecific molecules. In addition, Teneobio also brings a novel lower affinity CD3 engaging technology that complements our BiTE platform. The availability of a second CD3 engager will allow us to broaden our bi-specifics capabilities and enable customization of the T-Cell engaging domain, depending on the disease and target.  Finally, we're acquiring clinical and pre-clinical oncology programs directed against high-value targets of interest, which we specifically selected based on our own discovery efforts and target validation. These include a Phase 1 bispecific antibody for prostate cancer that complements Acapatamab AMG 160, also targeting PSMA and amg 509 are targeting steep one which was recently granted fast-track designation by the FDA. Turning to oncology, we continue to Advance LUMAKRAS registration around the globe, with regulatory reviews and progress in multiple jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan. Feedback from the medical community on the LUMAKRAS launched in the U.S. has been overwhelmingly positive. and I've heard personally from oncologists who are excited to have LUMAKRAS available and are heavily screening their patients for KRAS G12C mutations. I'm pleased to report that more than 2,000 patients have received LUMAKRAS across more than 000 sites, and 900 investigators or treating physicians, including through our global early access programs. In the LUMAKRAS development program, we continue to advance our broad-based combination efforts. Initial data from our Vectibix combination in colorectal cancer have been accepted for presentation at ESMO in September and the MEK and oral EGFR combination abstracts will be submitted to a medical meeting in the fourth quarter. To expand our LUMAKRAS experience for SHP2 [Indiscernible] along with our ongoing collaboration with Revolution Medicines, we have also entered into a collaboration with Novartis for our SHP2 combination trial. Updates from our monotherapy, non-small cell lung cancer study, including additional biomarker analyses, as well as data in patients with stable brain metastases, have been accepted for presentation at the World Congress on lung cancer.  Recall that we are also investigating LUMAKRAS in patients with active brain metastases. We also plan on initiating a Phase II first-line non-small cell lung cancer study in patients with PD-L1 negative and or STK11 mutant tumors in the third quarter. In the Bemarituzumab program, we are having good discussions with regulators on the Phase 3 gastric cancer development path and plan to initiate a registration program by year-end. This will include two phases three trials. One investigating the utility of Bemarituzumab in combination with chemotherapy.  And the other evaluating the addition of Bemarituzumab to chemotherapy and the checkpoint inhibitor. We are also planning to potentially pivotal Phase II study with [Indiscernible], AMG 757. Our half-life extended BiTE molecule targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. And we look forward to discussing the next steps with regulators in the coming weeks. I am also pleased to report that we have completed enrollment in the castrate-resistant prostate cancer expansion cohort for [Indiscernible] or AMG 160.  In inflammation, continuing our leadership in dermatology, we are working closely with Kyowa Kirin to advance AMG 451, also known as KHK4083, a first-in-class OX40 antibody into Phase 3 for atopic dermatitis. We look forward to the presentation of the Phase 2 atopic dermatitis data at the annual meeting of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology at the end of September, as well as, initiating discussions with regulators on our Phase 3 development plans in the coming months. In addition, the FDA accepted the Otezla supplemental filing for mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Finally, we and our partners, AstraZeneca, we're very pleased that the FDA granted Tezepelumab priority review for the treatment of asthma, reflecting significant unmet medical need. In closing. I would like to thank the entire organization for continuing to advance important medicines for our patients. Peter? Peter Griffith : Thank you, Dave. And good day, everyone. I will briefly walk through our second-quarter financial results before discussing 2021 guidance. The second quarter marked another period of solid performance as we grew volumes 8%, increased investment in both internal and external innovation, and delivered 4% year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth. As stated earlier, Q2 revenues at 6.5 billion increased 5% year-over-year. Other revenues at 412 million increased 38% year-over-year, primarily driven by shipments of the COVID 19 antibody therapy to Lilly. We continue to expect full-year 2021 other revenues to be in the range of 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion.  The second quarter's non-GAAP operating expenses increased 15% year-over-year as we continue to make investments to drive growth and maximize shareholder value. We expect full-year operating expenses, including approximately $200 million of operating expenses related to the Rodeo, Five Prime, and Teneobio acquisitions, and also to the [Indiscernible] collaboration on an absolute basis to increase about 6% to 7% over last year. While delivering a full-year operating margin of roughly 50%.  On a non-GAAP basis, the cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 4.1% points on a year-over-year basis to 16.9%, driven primarily by product mix, including COVID-19 antibody shipments to Lilly, as well as, profit share and royalties. For the full year, we continue to expect the cost of sales as the percent of product sales to be 16% to 17%. Our cost of sales has increased as products with royalties and product share, profit share payments have increased. As a reminder, a few of our products subject to royalties are Aimovig and biosimilars such as MVASI, RIABNI, and KANJINTI.  Those subject to profit-sharing arrangements are Evenity and tezepelumab upon approval at launch. Non-GAAP R&D spending increased 11% year-over-year due to investments in [Indiscernible] acquired in Q2 as part of the Five Prime acquisition and increased investments in discovery research. For the full year, we continue to expect non-GAAP R&D spend. We'll increase as we progress our innovative early and late-stage pipeline programs. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to decline. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were favorable by $146 million on a year-over-year basis, due primarily to our portion of BeiGene 's results, which we record one quarter in arrears.  Q1 Beijing results reflect the upfront payment Beijing received in connection with a collaboration agreement. We expect our Q3 and Q4 non-GAAP other income and expense to be more in range with our Q1 and expect full-year net expense in the range of 1.3 billion to 1.5 billion. Now, turning to the outlook for the business for 2021. we are excited by our pipeline. This innovation is augmented and balanced by the business development that we have announced this year. Based on underlying market dynamics and our investment plans, we are reaffirming our 2021 revenue guidance range of 25.8 billion to 26.6 billion. And our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $16 to $17. Notwithstanding absorbing roughly $200 million. operating expenses mentioned above related to business development activities, including Five Prime, Rodeo, Teneobio, and the Kyowa Kirin collaboration. These ranges reflect uncertainty continuing in the second half of the year related to emerging variance Patient visits and lab test procedure trends in the United States continue to improve, but still remain below pre-COVID-19 levels.  Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance remains unchanged at 13.5% to 14.5%. Our capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at $900 million and our capital expenditures continue to reflect our investments in our manufacturing and related facilities, including improving their environmental footprint. Investments in digital technologies throughout our business, and increasing ESG investments. We expect share repurchases for 2021 to be in the upper range of $3 billion to $5 billion. This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Bob for Q&A. Bob Bradway : Okay. Erica, let's open the lines for questions. Maybe you could remind our callers of the procedure and our [Indiscernible] for them to ask 1 question so that we have the opportunity to get through everybody who has a desire to ask a question of us. And I feel sure our callers would like to know that it's Arvind's birthday today, so bear that in mind when you ask questions here this afternoon. Okay. Erica, open them up. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. And your first question is from Yaron Werber with Cowen and Company. Gabe Daoud : Hi. This is Gabe on for Yaron. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the quarter. My question is focused on the LUMAKRAS study in first-line lung cancer in patients with low PD-L1 and/or STK 11. Could you just talk about the, I guess your benchmarks for historical comparisons in the STK11 and G12C co-mutants, and what you would use as your reference there and any updates on your discussions with regulators? In the past, you mentioned that there could be a need for head-to-head studies in the future and what those can look like, what the comparison arms would be. Thank you. David Reese : Thanks, Dave. So, as we mentioned, as you pointed out, this study in first-line, non-small cell lung cancer will be conducted in patients who are either a PD-L1 negative or STK 11 mutant. These are populations of patients, of course, who -- patients who don't typically benefit from checkpoint inhibitors, where there's really, we think a lot of residual unmet medical need. In fact, STK 11 mutational status may help confer resistance to checkpoint inhibition. So, that is the population that we're targeting.  Whether this can be potentially registration enabling or not, I think it's too early to speculate. The FDA has generally been clear that in first-line lung cancer, they wish to see randomized trials. So, one would have to anticipate having a pretty spectacular efficacy readout to lead to registration based on a single-arm Phase 2 trial. Obvious -- if we saw compelling data, we would have the appropriate conversations going forward. Okay. The next question. Operator : Your next question is from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I just really wanted to focus on Arvind's age today. Bob Bradway : You and me both. Arvind Sood : Turned 30. Bob Bradway : You and me both. All right, what can we do for you? Umer Raffat : Congratulations. My question today was on the KRAS and really around whether there's any -- if you could just remind us of the plan for the interim is for the ongoing phase 3 study as well as whether there is any primary analysis limited to PD-L1 negative subset in particular. I'm quite intrigued that the first-line Phase 2 trial is limited to PD-L1 negative or STK 11. Thank you very much. David Reese : Yes. In terms of the Phase 3 trial, I think the best way to think about that, Umer, is that we expect data in the first half of next year. And given the general rapidity of progression of patients historically in second and third line lung cancer to standard therapy, the utility of an interim analysis may not be particularly useful, meaning the primary analysis often falls very quickly after an interim analysis. So, of course, we'll take a look at that and get a better sense in the second half of the year of the event rates.  But, I would really point to the primary analysis in the first half of next year as the major event. And then in first-line, as I said, we think that there is significant unmet medical need in the PD-L1 negative STK 11 mutant -- and/or STK 11 mutant population, given the relative refractoriness of those tumors to currently available treatments. And so, we're very much looking forward to getting that study launched shortly on and seeing the data readout. We'll provide guidance on timelines as soon as enrollment is really underway. Umer Raffat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Hey, happy birthday, Arvind, and thank you so much for taking the questions. I'm curious about the combination data of LUMAKRAS with Vectibix. Will that be in colorectal cancer only or should we expect to see combination data in non-small cell lung cancer? And related to that, can you comment on the potential for that combination data to drive incremental use of Vectibix? Thank you. David Reese : Thanks, Jay. Given the regimen that we're studying, you can expect that most of the patients that have been enrolled on that particular combination of LUMAKRAS and Vectibix will have colorectal cancer given the backbone of Vectibix here, although the trial is open across malignancies for treating physicians to enroll patients if they feel that regimen may be appropriate. In terms of driving uptake of Vectibix, I don't want to speculate on that. Our job here is really to generate these combination data and see if -- we think we can really drive things forward, particularly in colorectal cancer. Operator : Your next question is from Salim Syed with Mizuho. Salim Syed : Great. Thanks so much for the question, guys, and I'll add my Happy Birthday, Arvind. Me and you are both 30. So, I just wanted to focus on the tax petition if I can. So, it seems like this notice of deficiency was not just for one year, but it was for three years; 2010, 2011, and 2012. So, I'm just curious there is a pattern here and how you guys are doing the accounting and is triggering this notice of deficiencies. And I guess the underlying question here is should we be expecting -- I noticed the deficiency or [Indiscernible] for 2013 through '20. And then just curious what the interest rate is that the IRS would impose here. Thank you. Peter Griffith : Salim, thank you. It's Peter. And on your question around the IRS matter, the dispute. Look, these notices are related to a transfer pricing dispute with the IRS regarding the allocation of the profits between the U.S. and the territory of Puerto Rico. So, you can see we have a difference of opinion on the value of the significant risks and the complexity we undertake with activities performed at our Puerto Rico facility.  We strongly believe the IRS' position is without merit, and we have appropriate tax reserves, and this dispute will take several years to resolve. I would like to note Salim that Puerto Rico is our flagship manufacturing facility, responsible for the majority of Amgen's global manufacturing. We're proud of our Puerto Rico operations, very proud of them, and our colleagues there. We've had a major manufacturing presence in Puerto Rico for about 30 years.  We have more than 2,200 highly skilled colleagues in Puerto Rico and who produce very sophisticated biologic medicines for patients all over the world with serious diseases. We've invested nearly $4 billion to expand and modernize those facilities in Puerto Rico, and we're proud to be consistently recognized as one of the island's best and most responsible employers. So, on the matter of interest rate, I'll have to refer you to the IRS for that, but that's the IRS matter in brief. Salim Syed : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn : Great, thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe another one for Peter. I was just wondering if you can comment on the margins longer term. I noticed you called out that royalty and profit splits are going to be increasing here, given some of the newer products you're launching, but how should we think about that 50% operating margin this year and the cadence on the forward? Thank you. Peter Griffith : Terence, thank you. And, as always, we don't give long-term margin guidance, but what I'd really like to say, our Northstar around this, we always pause and think about our objective is to grow our after-tax cash flows for the enterprise versus targeting specific operating margin or OpEx growth rates. So, we're going to continue to make prudent investments that lead to that objective. So, I would just note, we're continuing to invest in internal, external innovation.  You've seen the fruits of that in the second quarter, the launches of new products, broader digitalization efforts. Secondly, we highlighted our expectation that R&D expenses are going to grow year-over-year as we increase our spend on AMG 160 and AMG 757 and dose-expansion. We\u2019re going to rapidly advance those assets in the prostate in small cell lung cancer. We have three biosimilars in Phase III, three inflam in Phase II. Third, I'll just note Terence that we're absorbing the upfront costs related to the acquisition of Rodeo, as well as the cost of the Five Prime acquisition. our recent collaboration with Kyowa Kirin, and our recently announced the acquisition of Teneobio, which we do expect to close in the second half of 2021. We also plan to rapidly progress these Phase 3 ready molecules in the development of bema and KHK4083. We began being higher manufacturing costs in Q2.  Those were related to the Lilly COVID antibody effort. Net adds to the OpEx build for the rest of the year or two. But on a year-over-year basis, remember, we're comparing as depressed spend in Q2 and Q3 2020 due to COVID. So, at the end of the day, there's any number of financial metrics that we expect to be measured on by our investors and the analysts, and and we take pride in knowing that we want to end up really at the top of the group in terms of our operating efficiency. So that's very important to us. So, you can rest assured that we'll continue to stay focused on that. Operator : Your next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Dave, I was wondering if you could just comment on the IL-2 mutein. I know we're going to see some of the data here for SLE towards the end of the year, but it looks like you've started Phase 2 and you're also looking at UC, just maybe broadly on the profile and what you think you need to generate on Phase 2b to have that be a competitive asset? David Reese : Yeah, thanks, Matt. I'm glad you brought up AMG 592, our IL-2 mutein. Just to remind everyone, this is a molecule designed to enhance the number and function of T regulatory cells, some of the key modulatory cells in the immune system. In many autoimmune diseases, the T regulatory access is out of whack. As you mentioned, we anticipate sharing Phase 1b data in lupus at a medical meeting towards the end of the year. And we'll look forward there -- being able to share those data with you. In addition, a Phase II trial in lupus is actively enrolling now.  And then finally, as you mentioned, Matt, we are launching a study in ulcerative colitis, another autoimmune disorder, in which there's quite a bit of evidence of dysregulation of the [Indiscernible] So I think it's really the Phase 2 readouts here that will be critical as we accrue those data. As always, we'll look to make sure that we are adding something to what is standardly available. In lupus, there remains a very large residual unmet medical need. There was an approval within the last day or two, of course, but only the second drug in 40 years and a very large patient population, they're still requiring active medicines are ulcerative colitis particularly for a long-term remission is also an area with substantial unmet medical needs. So, it's full speed ahead in the IL-2 mutein program. We'll look forward to sharing this data with you. Operator : Your next question is from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Afternoon guys. Thanks for the question and happy birthday, Arvind. Commercial question on Otezla for Murdo. And so, when you look at the growth in the first half of this year, how much of a factor was COVID versus, say, competition or pricing? And do you think any of these headwinds could impact the upcoming launch when you look at the mild to the moderate disease-patient population? Thank you. Murdo Gordon : : Yes. Thanks, Geoff, I would say throughout the course of last year, we saw a slowdown in the number of bio-naive psoriasis patients moving into the market based on COVID disruption to patient visits. And given that Otezla is an early option in the treatment of psoriasis, we were impacted by that, I would say more than the biologics which tend to gain growth from Otezla and from each other. So that slowdown in the new patient diagnoses last year compounds our growth rate this year. The good news of the quarter is we saw new patient trends tick up. So, we did see 10% growth in new patients, prescribed new-to-brand prescriptions in the quarter.  However, this was somewhat offset by an increase in the number of patients that switched away from Otezla to another treatment. And we think that that was pent-up treatment decision-making that didn't happen because patients weren't going to see their dermatologists last year. There were some price reductions mostly related to our co-pay programs, but that's usually a good indication of new patients starting.  So, overall, I would say it's primarily COVID impact. With respect to other products coming in, I'm not sure how to answer that. What I can say is we continue to like our share position, that our share has held in the share of bio-naive psoriasis patients, and we continue to feel optimistic about the growth of Otezla given the pending indication in mild-to-moderate patients, which should come hopefully by the end of this year. Teams continue to execute well. Our field execution, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, is improving. And we're very focused on making sure we continue to grow Otezla over the long haul. Geoff Meacham : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny Gal : Hi. Good afternoon. And thank you for taking my question. Let's start with the immunology team here. You guys are developing both STELARA and [Indiscernible] for 2023 2024's biosimilars. And given you going to be both sides of the innovation in a similar world, I was wondering if you had a thought about the long-term trajectory of pricing in the immunology markets. That is, without giving specific numbers, do you -- should we begin to see something along the lines of what we see with diabetes with ongoing gradual price decreases. It's like how do you think about this market long term? Bob Bradway : Murdo, do you want to [Indiscernible]? Murdo Gordon : : Sure. Thanks for the question, Ronny. I'm hesitant to go out too far. What we are seeing, of course, and inflammation right now, there is a lot of new entrants, a lot of new mechanisms, and a lot of competition which is increasing. the gross-to-nets, that new [Indiscernible] have to pay to secure access. We're also seeing increased management by the large national PBMs of national formularies as to which mechanisms get placed in a preferred status versus being held in reserve after patients fail in earlier lines of therapy.  So, if we take rheumatoid arthritis as an example, I do see TNS continuing to entrench themselves in that first-line position, and novel mechanisms are likely to be in the second and perhaps even third line after patients have failed to have a resolution of their RA symptoms or improve the progression of their disease. In the biosimilar dynamics, I think we're seeing now the increase in interest from both payers, and PBMs, and providers, given some of the trends that we're seeing with the early biosimilars in the inflammation category. And I do think that interest in biosimilars will increase.  And I think that biosimilar penetration of parent molecule or originator molecule will accelerate with the new entrant. So, we're expecting that to be the condition on the [Indiscernible] by the time we launch AMGEVITA In the U.S. But overall, I would just come back to the strength that we have as a Company given our portfolio of innovator or originator molecules enhanced with the presence of our biosimilar portfolio. And I think that affords us an opportunity to serve many patients across a host of autoimmune diseases, as well as serve -- providers, payors, and PBMs with a lot of value to deliver to the healthcare system. Operator : Your next question is from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Geoffrey Porges : Thank you. Thank you very much for taking the question. I'll continue with the biosimilar guidance. Specifically, on Denosumab, what are you thinking in terms of the first biosimilar coming in for which is also an excuse me. And then would you expect the erosion trajectory for a brand of Prolia and XGEVA to be similar to, for example, [Indiscernible] or so the erosion of the oncology biologics or would you expect it to be more gradual, or faster just wondering what you think the trajectory will look like? Murdo Gordon : : Thanks Geoffrey, for the question. I would say, it's again, hard to project into the future as to how the healthcare system's payors and providers will change in their adoption of biosimilars. But I think given that Denosumab is a Part B product, the oncology biosimilar curves would be a close approximation of what we defining for. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions. We had a two-parter for David, on [Indiscernible] You have upcoming data for MEK plus or minus EGFR. Just wanted to understand in the context, how to interpret that data, what is good data, and is the goal to significantly increase response rate and PFS beyond democrats alone. Maybe just help us right-size how to think about that study. And you also announced that you expanded a combination with the Novartis SHP2, is that just diversifying and spreading it around or how to think about SHP2 if you have done a second collaboration there. Thank you. David Reese : Thanks, Mike. Let me start with the second part first. You're exactly right. That's simply diversifying our experience. We're moving forward as I noted with both Revolution Medicines on combination as well as this new collaboration with Novartis [Indiscernible] we look forward to both datasets. In terms of the MEK or EGFR combinations, as I've said before, in terms of response rate, it's going to vary by line of therapy and indication in terms of what sort of increments that you want to see.  But generally, 10%, 20%, 30% relative improvement in response rates and progression-free survival, certainly beyond first-line, is typically what we would want to see and those are the rough sort of benchmarks that we'll use. And on these first cohorts, of course, the critical thing upfront is safety and determining appropriate doses, and then moving into expansion cohorts for efficacy. Thanks again. Michael Yee : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Alethia Young : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And happy birthday to one of the best in IR games. And cheers to you, Arvind. Arvind Sood : Thank you, Alethia. Alethia Young : I wanted to get a little bit of flavor on Repatha, and I know you're seeing very nice volume growth, but like continued kind of pricing pressure or discounting pressure. Do you think we're kind of hitting a stabilization point? I know you've talked about the little bit of sequential deceleration, but if you can give us some flavor on how to think about when that might start to the right size and stabilize and see real growth from the volume that you're generating. Murdo Gordon : : Yes. Thanks. Alethia. We're quite happy with the performance of Repatha and us now to really treat a large number of patients, we reached a million patients now with Repatha. So quite a milestone. The overall dynamic that is dragging price down is really a U.S. Part D patient dynamic, as patients enter into the coverage gap or as we sometimes refer to the donut hole. And as we expand our percentage or share of business in the Part D or Medicare Part D business and segment of the market.  We will see some net-negative price drag quarter-over-quarter. Now, it's not -- not going to be as precipitous as the price changes that we've made historically. So, our volume is outpacing that and we will see that drop to the net sales lines. So overall, good evolution. We're also seeing nice growth on Repatha ex-U.S. where the price is relatively stable year on year. So that part of the mix is helping bolster price evolution over time as well. But some slight drag will continue. But again, it's a good sign because it means we're expanding that Medicare pool of patients much more rapidly than we did historically. Alethia Young : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets. Kennen MacKay : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just would love to get a perspective on [Indiscernible] combinations you're most excited about currently for LUMAKRAS, whether it's more in line with previously with the oral and antibody MEK inhibitors, to the M2 inhibitor maybe, or with the Novartis collaboration. does the SHP2 now take the top seat? And then just 1 quick question on the biosimilar pipeline, when do you see the earliest that you might be able to launch your biosimilar EYLEA, it's ABP 938? Thanks so much and congrats on the [Indiscernible]. David Reese : Yeah. Maybe I'll start with the question on combinations. Of course, the ones we like the best are the ones that work and that's what we're testing right now. It would actually -- all of these combinations have been selected for one or another reason or both. One, most importantly, is a biological possibility. so, reason to believe in either additive or synergistic effects.  And then two, if combining molecules are part of a background regimen, and so we think we're really covering the waterfront in terms of indications of interest with relevant combinations here. And at this point, Ken and I, I think it's really an empirical matter of generating the data. And of course, I will share that as we've outlined. Murdo Gordon : : And, Ken, and we haven't announced our timing on EYLEA, but we are moving quickly in the enrollment of that program and we anticipate being early in the sequence of launches for that product. Kennen MacKay : Fair enough. Thanks, Murdo. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter Gould : Good afternoon. I'll pass on my happy birthday wishes to Arvind too. I wanted to ask about your OX40 program. I know it's moving into Phase III next year. Just wanted to see any further color on the population or dosing you're looking to move forward with it in Phase III. And if the lingering uncertainty over the JAKS, as in any way changed or evolved your, your underlying assumptions around that market, would be helpful? Thank you. David Reese : Yeah. Thanks, Carter. We're very enthusiastic about this molecule. Atopic dermatitis is a disease with widespread prevalence actually in global populations. despite existing therapies. We think there is a very large amount of residual net medical need. Patients often cycle through therapies. Given the novel mechanism of action, we're targeting the OX40 pathway. We think there is quite a big opportunity to have a real impact in this field.  As I mentioned, we'll be presenting the Phase 2b data at the end of September at one of the major European dermatology meetings and I think there you'll get a sense of our thoughts on dosing and what things may look like going forward, and of course, as we have discussions with regulators, we'll outline our plans on the phase 3 program, which will in all likelihood be a suite of studies. Let me ask Murdo to comment a little further here. Murdo Gordon : : Yeah, Carter, we obviously pay close attention to the JAKs safety concerns as raised on the Xeljanz data and applied some reduction in JAK penetration assumptions to the AD market when we were evaluating the attractiveness of the OX40 asset. And I think that was one of the drivers here. We [Indiscernible] that the biologic still has a large role to play. We think initially the OX40 asset will establish perhaps a second-line opportunity in the market. And we can expand from there. But the portion of the market that we think will be addressed by JAKs is probably smaller than was once considered. Operator : Your next question is from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory Kasimov : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And most importantly, happy birthday to Arvind. I wanted to go back to the line of questioning around the LUMAKRAS combination work and ask specifically about what you're doing with PD-1s at this point, when you expect to have an update there. And is it really still just about trying to figure out the dosing currently before you move forward? Thank you. David Reese : Yeah. Thanks, Cory. As we've discussed before, we're looking at both direct combinations and sequential therapy here. So, I think you can see -- you can expect to see data from both of those sometime through the first half of next year or so as we accumulate enough data to define what the relevant path forward is with a checkpoint inhibitor. So more to come there, but we continue to actively work on these development programs. Cory Kasimov : Okay. Thank you, David. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Allison Bratzel : Hi. This is Alli Bratzel on for Chris this afternoon. Thanks for taking our question. Just on PD, you've had a lot of activity in the oncology and inflammation space. Just any color on how you're prioritizing other areas of interest on the development side versus opportunities to bolster some of your more legacy commercial franchises like renal. And then maybe more specifically on renal, how are you thinking about your longer-term strategy or prioritization for investing in the franchise via internal or external innovation. Thanks. Bob Bradway : So Alli, I'll just repeat what I've said many times before, which is that our business development efforts are focused on the areas where we have an ongoing strong research presence and/or commercial presence. So, you're right, we've been active in oncology and in the immunology area. We continue to look for opportunities in both those spaces as well as in general medicine.  And to the extent that we see things that we think we're going to add value to in nephrology or bone health, or the migraine area, we'll look there as well. So active efforts are underway and we look, again, across the marketplace actively. We'll focus on how we can earn a return for our shareholders from the assets that we might license or acquire. Are you just -- just sorry? Just quickly. I don't think I addressed your nephrology question. We don't have as much active research in nephrology and bone at the moment. And because we haven't seen internally opportunities to advance novel therapies there, we think the medicines we have are addressing the needs in the marketplace very effectively, but to the extent that there are things outside of Amgen that fit well with our 30-years of leadership, for example, nephrology or with our global leadership in bone, and we pay close attention to that as well. Operator : Your next question is from Dane Leone with Raymond James. Dane Leone : : Hi. Thank you for taking the questions and my congratulations to Arvind. Hope you have a fun birthday tonight after the call, so I'll keep it brief. My questions on Tarlatamab. Question from me here is what you guys think you need to see as you're planning for this Phase 2 study? Obviously, initial data seems encouraging from the first 52 patients you had earlier this year.  But where do you want to think about positioning this drug in the different lines of small-cell lung cancer now, and what have you may be seeing as the dose escalation studies progressed since maybe we've seen the last data update that has you thinking about a pivotal study now? Thank you. David Reese : Yes, thanks, Dane, I think to take the last part of your question. what we've seen are ongoing response rates consistent with -- response rates consistent with the data that you saw from the later cohorts that we presented a month or 2 ago. And in addition, we've actually been impressed with the duration of response. Most of these patients are third line plus, which, as you know, is a very aggressive disease in small cell lung cancer. And durable responses here are vanishing rare. So that I think is in addition.  What really gives us encouragement here. As we discussed the potential registrational path with the FDA in the coming weeks, I think we will focus on the patient population, but I think the initial foray is likely to be those later lines of therapy. We are moving forward in our development program now and are actively investigating earlier lines of therapy as well. That is clearly the end game that we're pointing for with Tarlatamab. And given the sort of activity that we're seeing in the clinic right now. Dane Leone : : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim. Michael Schmidt : Hi, guys. I have 1 more on LUMAKRAS. Thanks for taking my question. And Arvind, congrats [Indiscernible] as well. So, I guess, hypothetically, should be efficacy safety profile of the LUMAKRAS inhibitor combinations turn out to be insufficient, which I guess could be possible. What are other likely avenues to positively enable access to a broad first-line KRAS non-smoker lung cancer indication? Should we think about potential chemo combinations or are there others that are logical come to mind? Thanks so much. David Reese : Thanks, Michael. I think you're exactly right. With the chemotherapy combinations, number one. And then going into biomarker selected populations. As we've discussed in terms of our planned upcoming first-line [Indiscernible] which we'll be launching on shortly. And so, should checkpoint inhibitor combinations not be feasible, I would expect that we would piece together other routes to first-line to find patients who are most likely to benefit. Michael Schmidt : Great, thanks so much. Bob Bradway : Erica, as we're pushing up against the top of the hour, why don't we take our final 2 questions. Operator : Okay. Your next question is from Brian Skorney with Baird. Brian Skorney : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question and happy birthday, Arvind. Thinking a little more on the disclosed notice of deficiency today. I think last year you also received an [Indiscernible] and modified [Indiscernible] related to 2013 through 2015 and are also under investigation for 2016 through 2018 by the IRS and just seems like this all-related issue is around profit allegation in Puerto Rico.  So, I was wondering if you could just walk through the next steps in terms of the tax for a petition. Can they -- can the petition to be heard in tax court fail? And if it does go to court and the decision goes against you, does that sort of established precedence for the other years as well. And based on the IRS calculation methodology for 2010, for 2012, have you run that same calculation to establish what number bound of liabilities for 2013 through now would be? Peter Griffith : Yes. Brian, thank you for the question. Look, we filed a petition with the U.S. tax [Indiscernible]. In this case, it could take several years to resolve. The IRS is also proposing significant adjustments to 2013 and '15, relate to similar issues. As you know. We disagree, strongly disagree with the proposed adjustments.  We're pursuing a resolution with the IRS Administrative Appeals Office on that. The IRS, as you notice, they're currently auditing the years 2016 through '18., so yes, we're sure they'll take the same position for the other periods under audit. We believe that we have adequate reserves for that. Brian Skorney : Great, thank you. Bob Bradway : Hey, let's go to the final question. Operator : Your final question is from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Andrew Galler : Hey, this is Andrew Galler on for Tim. I just wanted to ask one question on [Indiscernible]. So, given your partner AstraZeneca officially discontinued atopic dermatitis last week, can you talk about any impact on your competitive positioning? The decision Eastern availed to look asthma, do be given the high coincidence of atopic conditions? David Reese : I mean, I think the short answer here is no, and we remain extremely bullish about tezepelumab, given its activity across a range of patients with asthma, regardless of eosinophil count. As we mentioned, we were granted priority review by the FDA. Clearly an acknowledgment of the potential fit of this medicine with a large residual unmet medical need. So that's [Indiscernible]. That doesn't really give us positive [Indiscernible]. Bob Bradway : Okay, Erica. Well, let me just thank our callers for joining the call today. We're excited about the second half of the year, a lot going on here. And so, we look forward to having the opportunity to gather with you in October and update you on the next quarter. Appreciate your interest in Amgen. Thank you. Arvind Sood : Thanks, everybody. Operator : This concludes Amgen's Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question and answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks.  In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Erica (ph) Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to our Q3 call. I think the 3 key themes for this quarter are continued execution, pipeline advancement, and preparedness to long [Indiscernible] new products. Let's get started.  The slides have been posted. A quick reminder that we use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO Bob Bradway. Bob (ph). Bob Bradway : Okay, hello, everyone and thank you for joining our call. It was another solid quarter of growth for Amgen with total revenues rising 4% driven by volume growth of 8%, which reflects the strong global demand for many of our innovative medicines such as Repatha and Prolia as well as for our high-quality biosimilars. Earnings per share for the quarter grew 11%, thanks to disciplined management of our operating expenses. Shifting to the future. As we begin to see beyond COVID-19, I believe we've set ourselves up well to deliver attractive growth over the long term.  By way of example, I'll draw your attention to our immunology and oncology portfolios, where we are building on our successful track record through a combination of internally generated innovation and strategic business development, which we expect to contribute to our long-term growth. In inflammation, we're very excited about Tezepelumab, a first-in-class treatment for severe asthma that we hope to launch in the U.S. next year.  Given that millions of patients for whom existing asthma therapies are inadequate, we believe Tezepelumab will be a significant growth driver for us for years to come. This product builds on our many years of success in inflammation. First with ENBREL and now, of course with Otezla. We remain optimistic about the growth potential of Otezla. And as the next step, we are eagerly awaiting an expanded indication in the U.S. for mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis, particularly at a time when concerns have emerged for some potential new competitors. We also continue to grow Otezla globally with the product now available in over 40 countries, up from 32 countries when we acquired it.  Looking a bit further into the future, we expect to bring AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to Humira, to the U.S. in 2023. We expect to replicate the success we've had with the AMGEVITA in many other markets around the world. We're also enthusiastic about AMG 451, phase three ready, potential first-in-class treatment for atopic dermatitis that we're studying with our partners Kyowa Kirin, as well as a number of Amgen discovered therapies currently in Phase 2 for lupus and celiac disease.  In oncology, we're happy with the recent launch in the U.S. of LUMAKRAS, our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor, which treats non-small cell lung cancer. And we look forward to additional approvals and launches in major markets around the world as we roll forward. LUMAKRAS joins a portfolio of medicines already generating some $10 billion a year in sales. Several of these Medicines delivered double-digit sales growth in the third quarter, including KYPROLIS, BLINCYTO, and [Indiscernible]. Looking ahead, we're excited about the growth potential of several other oncology assets in our pipeline. We have initiated already our first Phase III trial for Bemarituzumab, a potential first-in-class molecule to treat gastric and gastro esophageal junction cancers. We're also making good progress with several of our internally discovered solid BiTE -- solid tumor BiTE molecules, including one for prostate cancer and another for small cell lung cancer. In short, we have a number of products now on the market with plenty of room to grow, more coming over the next several years from our pipeline, a compelling discovery research engine to continuously replenish that pipeline, and the wherewithal to take advantage of compelling business development opportunities as they arise. All that gives me confidence in our ability to serve more patients around the world, and to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders.  On a final note, I would like to take my Amgen colleagues for their continued commitment to patients and to our business. We were delighted to be named last week by Fortune Magazine as one of the 25 best workplaces in the world. And that's a reflection of our people in the passion and excellence they bring to their work. David, let me turn it over to you. David Reese : Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. I would like to begin by welcoming our new colleagues from Teneobio who bring expertise and technologies that will accelerate our innovation. One of our core areas of interest in research and molecular engineering is the development of multi-specific drugs to make undruggable targets tractable.  The Teneobio acquisition combined with our previous incorporation of new evolution and its DNA encoded library technology, provides capabilities to develop both large and small molecule multi-specifics, and is a good example of how we're combining internal and external sources of innovation to advance the R&D portfolio. More than 60% of the molecules in our pre -clinical pipeline multi-specifics, we will have more to say as those programs advance. Across R&D, we have focused on building a portfolio of complementary assets in certain disease areas to help drive the long-term growth of the Company. Turning to our clinical programs, I will highlight a few areas where we have made significant progress and are advancing multiple first-in-class molecules.  In oncology, one key area of focus is lung cancer. As you'll hear from Murdo (PH), the LUMAKRAS launch is off to an excellent start and the clinical programs remain on track. We have initiated the Phase 2 study of LUMAKRAS mono-therapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer for patients with STK11 mutant and or PD-L1 negative tumors.  We continue to expect the top-line results from the Phase three confirmatory study versus docetaxel, as well as data from our PD-1 combination and ship combination cohorts in the first half of next year. In the TearLab Numab or AMG B-757 Bite program targeting DLL3 in small cell lung cancer for some patients with very advanced disease in the Phase 1 trial have now had responses lasting over a year, supporting our potentially registrational Phase 2 study, which we intend to launch by year-end. Finally, in squamous non-small cell lung cancer, we will initiate a Phase 1B study of bemarituzumab directed against FGFR2b in the coming months. Turning to gastrointestinal cancers, we will begin enrolling a Phase 3 trial of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in 3L+ Colorectal Cancer in the coming weeks. In first-line gastric cancer, we have initiated the first multiple Phase 3 studies with bemarituzumab, with additional trials starts in the coming months. These studies will address regional differences in the treatment of gastric cancer by exploring Bemarituzumab in combination with either backbone chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus a checkpoint inhibitor.  Prostate cancer is another area of focus in oncology. With the acquisition of Teneobio, we now have 2 distinct bi-specific T-Cell engager technologies targeting PSMA. We anticipate decision enabling data from the expansion cohort in the 8-cap [Indiscernible] AMG 160 program in the first half of next year and are now exploring outpatient administration. AMG 340, formerly TNB 585 continues to progress through dose escalation and we anticipate having informative data by the middle of next year as well, allowing us to determine the best path forward for one or both of these PSMA molecules. Finally, rounding out our prostate cancer portfolio is AMG 509 targeting Steap1 which is also progressing through dose escalation. We anticipate having decision-making data next year.  In inflammation, we spoke at length a few weeks ago about the increasing activity in our portfolio of both innovative and biosimilar molecules, regulatory approvals and launches expected in each of the next several years. In the Tezepelumab program, regulatory reviews in severe asthma are proceeding with an FDA action date in the first quarter of 2022. Studies in 3 additional indications are in progress to investigate the utility of Tezepelumab across a range of inflammatory diseases. In skin autoimmune diseases, the FDA review of Otezla for mild-to-moderate psoriasis continues with a PDUFA date in December. A few weeks ago, we presented results from a Phase II study of AMG 451/KHK4083, the first-in-class dual action anti-OX40 anti body we're developing for atopic dermatitis in collaboration with Kyowa Kirin. These data were very well received by the medical community as there is a clear need for innovative therapies with differentiated mechanisms of action for these patients. We have had productive regulatory interactions on the program and plan to launch Phase III trials in the first half of 2022. Finally, we also expect Phase III data from biosimilar candidates [Indiscernible] STELARA, EYLEA, and Soliris in the inflammation portfolio next year. In cardiometabolic disease in atherosclerosis through [Indiscernible] trial, Phase III outcomes study of approximately 12,000 patients at high-cardiovascular risk, but without prior myocardial infarction or stroke, is expected to complete enrollment in the coming weeks.  Olpasiran a small interfering RNA targeting lipoprotein(a) and our first RNA-based therapy remains on track to readout Phase 2B data by the middle of 2022 and provides a potential complement to Repatha in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by serving patients whose pathology is not driven by LDL cholesterol.  In conclusion, with an innovative portfolio where approximately 3/4 of our clinical stage programs have first-in-class potential, and the growing portfolio of biosimilars, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver important new medicines for patients, and growth for shareholders over the near and long term. Murdo. Murdo Gordon : Thank you, Dave (ph). Third quarter product sales increased 4% year-over-year. Volumes increased 8% globally, and we had record quarterly sales for several of our key products including EVENITY, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, and Nplate. Our ex-U.S. business grew 19% with volume growth of 25% year-over-year. We continue to execute our volume-driven growth strategy and see gradual recovery in our business from the impact of the pandemic.  During the early part of Q3, we saw [Indiscernible] in patient care dynamics due to a surge in COVID-19. As we progress through the quarter, we saw improvement in patient visits and diagnosis. Total customer activity improved during Q3, however, face-to-face customer interactions remained below 2019 levels.  Now, let me review some product details beginning with our general medicine portfolio, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha, and Aimovig. Overall revenue for our general medicine portfolio grew 22% year-over-year, with 24% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 15% year-over-year, driven by double-digit volume growth.  In the third quarter, new and repeat patient demand continued to improve as Osteoporosis diagnosis rates reached over 90% of pre - COVID levels. EVENITY which complements Prolia in our bone portfolio had record sales of $149 million for the third quarter driven by strong volume growth. Given the severe impact of fractures on the lives of postmenopausal women, EVENITY provides an excellent therapy to build bone first. Moving to Repatha, which remains the global leader in the PCSK9 class. Repatha sales increased 33% year-over-year driven by 42% volume growth. In the U.S. we saw 64% year-over-year volume growth. This was partially offset by lower net selling price stemming from an increase in the number of Medicare Part D patients receiving Repatha and who entered the donut hole. Outside the U.S. volumes grew 24% year-over-year. We remain confident in our ability to grow Repatha globally to address the significant unmet medical need in treating high-risk cardiovascular patients. Moving to our inflammation portfolio, Otezla sales increased 13% year-over-year with 7% volume growth. Since its launch, Otezla has been used by over 750,000 patients globally. And in the U.S. it is the leader in bio-naive psoriasis patient share. Otezla has 92% commercial payer coverage and is an affordable, safe, and efficacious option for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients. We are now preparing for the anticipated U.S. approval of the mild-to-moderate psoriasis indication in the fourth quarter when we will have the opportunity for the first time to promote the use of Otezla in this patient population. ENBREL sales decreased 3% year-over-year driven by a 2% decline in volume. This is the second straight quarter of slowing volume declines thanks to ENBREL's long track record of efficacy and safety. Together with our partner AstraZeneca, we're preparing for the launch of tezepelumab in the U.S. with an expected PDUFA date in early Q1 2022. Our Salesforce is fully staffed, trained, and has been deployed to provide disease state education. We're actively engaging with payers to ensure access to patients for this breakthrough medicine. We look forward to bringing Tezepelumab to the 2.5 million people around the world who live with severe uncontrolled asthma.  Moving to the hematology and oncology business, sales of our 6 innovative products and our [Indiscernible] KANJINTI biosimilars, collectively totaled $1.8 billion in the quarter, growing 12% year-over-year. Several brands had record sales in the quarter, including Hytiva, KYPROLIS, Nplate, and BLINCYTO. Neulasta Onpro maintained 50% volume share in the quarter and continues to be the preferred choice for physicians and patients. The most recent published average selling price for Neulasta in the U.S. declined 38% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter. Going forward, we expect increased competition to result in continued net price on volume erosion.  Our launch of LUMAKRAS is off to a strong start with revenues of $36 million in Q3 and cumulative sales of $45 million through the end of the third quarter. LUMAKRAS has been prescribed by over 500 oncologists in both academic and community settings. A majority of clinical laboratories have updated their testing reports to reflect KRAS G12C as an actionable mutation.  And approximately 75% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer are now being tested for the mutation at the time of diagnosis. Having been a part of several lung cancer launches in my career, I'm very pleased with the LUMAKRAS launch uptake in the U.S. Thanks to our broad player access and the positive reaction from the oncology community.  I would say the U.S. health authorities have also approval LUMAKRAS in Canada and LUMAKRAS in the U.K. Overall; I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, our record sales across a number of products, and our increasing levels of customer activity. And with that, I will turn it to Peter. Peter Griffith : Thank you, Murdo. I will briefly walk through our third quarter financial results before discussing 2021 guidance. Our team\u2019s quality of execution during the past 18 challenging months continues to provide us with the strength to make timely, prudent investments as we see them in both internal and external innovation that will deliver long-term growth. Let's now turn to the business. The third quarter marked another period of solid performance with year-over-year revenue growth of 4% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 11%. As Murdo described, strong volume growth continued in the quarter with 8% year-over-year growth driven by Prolia, EVENITY, and Repatha and in BLINCYTO. In addition, this quarter includes $147 million of favorable changes to estimated sales deductions previously recorded. In the third quarter last year, the favorable estimated sales deductions were $36 million, resulting in $111 million year-over-year benefit in this quarter.  Our established products, which include Neulasta, Neupogen, Epogen, Aranesp, [Indiscernible] and Sensipar declined 21% year-over-year, driven by volume declines and lower net selling price. These products will continue to contribute meaningful cash flows to our broader portfolio and also to innovation.  We do expect increased competition to result in additional erosion of these established products. Other revenues at $386 million increased 21% year-over-year, primarily driven by shipments of the COVID-19 antibody therapy to Lilly. We expect full-year 2021 other revenues to be in a range of 1.5 to 1.7 billion. Third quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses were flat year-over-year.  As continued focus on execution, productivity, and efficiency fueled investments to drive long-term growth. Including the third quarter's share of the approximately $200 million of operating expenses expected for the full year related to the Rodeo, Five Prime and Teneobio acquisitions, as well as the Kyowa Kirin collaboration. Through focused expense discipline, we now expect full-year operating expenses on an absolute basis to increase approximately 3 to 4% over last year, inclusive of the approximately $200 million related to these transactions. We will continue to execute on opportunities to allocate capital to important internal and external innovation opportunities.  On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 15.8% driven primarily by product mix, including COVID-19 antibodies shipments to Lilly. For the full-year, we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales, 16 to 17%. Non-GAAP R&D spends in the quarter decreased 4% year-over-year.  For the full year, we expect non-GAAP R&D spend will increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range as we progress our innovative pipeline programs, including the launch of registration enabling trials in lung and gastric cancer. Non-GAAP SG&A expense in the quarter decreased 5%, and we expect the full-year to also decline as we continue our focus on execution efficiency and digitalization.  Non-GAAP, other income and expense, net expenses increased on a year-over-year basis due to increased losses from our 20% share of Beijing's results recorded under the equity method of accounting one quarter in arrears. We expect full-year net expense in the range of $1.3 to $1.4 billion.  We have financial flexibility with $12.9 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet and strong cash flows. Additionally, our third quarter dividend was a $1.76 per share, an increase of 10% over last year. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2021, we have invested in internal and external innovation to advance our pipeline in 2021 and continue to set ourselves up well for long-term growth. Moving to revenue, based on underlying market dynamics, we are updating our 2021 revenue guidance range to $25.8 billion to $26.2 billion. We are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $16.50 to $17.10. Our non-GAAP tax rate range is updated to 13.0% to 14.0%.  Our capital expenditure guidance remains at $900 million and our capital expenditures continue to include investments supporting our environmental activities, and also support our commitment to attain carbon neutrality. We expect share repurchases for 2021 to be in the upper end of our range of 3 to 5 billion.  We executed effectively in the third quarter and are well-positioned for long-term growth. Before turning it over to Bob (ph), I'd like to thank and recognize our 24,000 AMGN colleagues around the world for delivering another strong quarter of execution. Bob (ph). Bob Bradway : Thank you, Peter (ph). Why don't we open up the call now for questions and let's remind our callers of the procedures and the request that we limit our questions to just 1 on the first go. Thanks. Operator : As a reminder [Operator Instruction]. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael Yee : Hey guys. Good afternoon. Good evening. Just a question about the financials and how to think about go-forward, it's sort of a high-level question, but as you think about the results this year, sort of the narrowing of guidance this year, a Company that typically seems to come in on the higher-end and I know there's a COVID pandemic ongoing. How do you think about the push and pull dynamics as we enter 2022? I know you don't give 2022 guidance, so I would just love for you to comment on the high level, realizing we're in a pandemic. Thank you. Bob Bradway : Yeah, Michael, you're right. We're not going to get to 2022 guidance at this point. I think what you can see are we continued to manage the business effectively. That's I think reflected in the 4% on the top-line and 11% on the bottom-line EPS growth. And we we'll continue to invest in opportunities that we think can deliver growth. We're very clear that as we look at the future we expect to be able to deliver growth for our shareholders and we'll have more to say about that when we give guidance for the next period. Michael Yee : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Aspen: Hey guys, it's Aspen [ph] on for Geoff. Thanks for the question. So you previously talked about over 3,000 patient number treated with LUMAKRAS that include some patients on studies. I guess I just want to get a sense of what percentage of that maybe the nonpaying bolus has been converted over the paying and maybe what's the timeline for moving through the rest of that mess. Thanks. Murdo Gordon : Hi it's Murdo, thanks for the question. We are roughly at about 75% of early access programs or patients who were enrolled in clinical trials converting to commercial supply. The two major markets where that's happening the U.S. obviously and, and in France. Well, we've not been approved in Europe yet. We do have access to the ATU program in France where patients coming out of our early access program can roll into the ATU program where we're actually a booking revenue. Aspen: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Chris Raymond : Thank you. I have a question on Aimovig or maybe more strategically your neurology presence. Just for the drug, obviously revenue in script trends is stalled and I think it's pretty obvious that the oral CGRPs that are having an impact on the market. Murdo I noticed that you skipped over that one in the prepared comments.  Maybe just talk about your commitment to neurology now with this market dynamic. Is this a category that we should expect more investment in from a product offering standpoint or is there maybe some other plan here that you could maybe talk about? Thanks. Murdo Gordon : Sure. Thanks, Chris. The first thing I would say is, Aimovig continues to be an important product to help patients suffering from migraine, and we continue to believe that there is a large population of migraine sufferers who have yet to be helped by the advent of the CGRP category.  Obviously as the market leaders in subcutaneous category of CGRP products, we have given up share to the orals as they've come into the market, but they've also expanded the market beyond the preventive setting and into the acute setting, and even the preventative setting has grown with the advent of the oral.  We expect that the market still has quite a bit of growth and headroom for growth. We expect to be able to continue to maintain our leadership share position in total prescriptions. We have over five years now of safety and efficacy data in the market. We continue now to have all of the U.S. commercial responsibility for Aimovig given recent work to consolidate what Novartis was previously contributing. So we've actually increased our neurology presence in the last few months.  And then the last piece that we're excited about is we are awaiting our head-to-head superiority data versus topiramate to be published and after which we'll be able to promote that to general neurologists, headache specialists, and even the many primary care physicians who are using Aimovig to help their patients who are chronic migraine sufferers. So a bit of headroom, you're right on the oral evolution taking some growth out and also a little bit of net price in the quarter taking some growth out as well. Bob Bradway : Strategically, we'll continue to look and see if we can find products that fit well with the franchise that we're building, we'll continue to look for those. Chris Raymond : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I feel like Amgen went through this period of getting a fair amount of credit for the clinical development in LUMAKRAS program. And we might be entering that phase where a lot of competitors have clinical stage programs on KRAS and we're about to get a lot of data over the next few months. And I guess my question is : What's your best case on how the clinical data across the field shakes out. Is this going to be a PD-1 situation where everybody is about the same or could you end up seeing approaches like wrath on inhibitors etc. to look any different on resistance mutations? And a follow-up to that also, I feel like as we think about Amgen's leadership on KRAS target in the first place, should we expect Amgen to file INDs on other KRAS mutations like G12D or G12C? Thank you. David Reese : Thanks, Umer, this is Dave. As you mentioned, of course there are multiple competitors coming behind LUMAKRAS. We feel very good about our position. I've not seen anything to tell us we don't have a really outstanding molecule, and many of those are very early, just starting dose escalation. I think it's premature to speculate on potential differentiated mechanism of action or these sorts of things. We also have a very broad-based global program.  As we mentioned, we're now under regulatory review, I think at last count it's now in over 15 jurisdictions or countries including EMEA and Japan where reviews are progressing and those are of course 2 very large markets. So I feel very good about where we are. We've got a large combination therapy program. There\u2019s a lot to learn yet, it took 40 years to get into the clinic and we're sorting out a lot of biology. But I feel very good about the molecule we've got and where we are. Bob Bradway : Dave, you want to say anything else about our G12D or B program? David Reese : Oh sorry. Thanks for the reminder. In terms of -- we are interested in other targets, as many of you know, there are 7 or 8, and specific KRAS mutations that are now potentially attractable although they are different on a structural basis and each one possess distinct challenges. We do have some work ongoing and as that progresses, we will say more about that publicly. Umer Raffat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Cowen. Gabe Daoud : Hey, this is Gabe on for Yaron. Thanks for taking my question. Just for LUMAKRAS to follow-up. So for the data with pembro, that's expected in the first half of next year, can you kind of give us some maybe set the stage a little bit for whether the data will be mature enough for to get a good look at efficacy.  What we have TPS status available for all patients? And then just for the second ship to combination arm that you recently added, any insight you could share into the thinking behind adding TNO -155. Was there any difference in the profile compared to the rev med molecule that you would highlight that might be a better overlap with LUMAKRAS? Thank you. David Reese : Yes. Thanks Gabe [ph]. The -- in terms of the what I would say broadly the checkpoint inhibitor combination data, we do expect to have a fulsome enough dataset when we have everything together and present at some point in the first half of next year to I think give good insights to the field about what these combinations look like.  In terms of the various SHP2 inhibitors for which we're pursuing combinations. There are some biochemical differences between those drugs. And I think it's well worth our while given the potential importance and the mechanistic rationale of SHP2 as a combination target for us to examine those various molecules, and so we're pressing forward on all fronts. Thank you. Gabe Daoud : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Geoffrey Porges : Very much for taking my question. Maybe just another slightly big-picture one, Bob and Murdo. I know you pay close attention to what's going on in DC and IBM sitting, where do you think that we're close to having a deal on drug pricing reform and particularly, could you give us a sense of what the financial impact on Amgen would be of the proposed Part D changes. And then secondly, do you believe that you have any molecules that would be subject to negotiation under the proposed part of negotiation of part B -- selected part B drugs in the current language. Thanks. Bob Bradway : Thanks, Jeff. It's obviously very premature for anybody to pretend like they know what the shape of the I mean, legislation will be. I don't think anybody has really seen any meaningful draft language. What we are aware of course, is that there's some tweeting and some back and forth between the house and the Senate, including moderates in both, suggesting that they're close in that they think they have a framework that they can align around.  So it will need to wait and see the details. And as you would expect, we will be focused on seeing whether what they're proposing leads to better access for patients to medicine and whether it does that while preserving the ecosystem that enables all of us to innovate the way we do and the way we think we need to for the country. Stay tuned, Geoff, again, it's very premature. I know you guys would love to have a picture that you could share with your investors and a picture that would make some sense, but I think anybody trying to draw one at this point is really doing it in the way of sculpting fog. Geoffrey Porges : Okay, thank you. Bob Bradway : Okay, thanks Geoff. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if we could just touch a little bit on your outlook for product guidance, it looks like you raised other revenue guidance, but you also took down the high end of your total Company guidance and maybe you could just talk about, and that looks like about $800 million swing if you add the two together. So maybe you could just talk about what's the driver there and where you're seeing the pressure. Thanks. Peter Griffith : Matthew (ph). Thank you. Peter, here. Listen on the revenue range, were -- 258 to 262 reflects the latest market dynamics as Murdo (ph) shared with you. Volume growth year-over-year from products Prolia, Otezla, Repatha, EVENITY biosimilars. Competition against the mature products, as I mentioned, but could create cash flow producers for us. The sharper recovery we'd anticipated early hasn't materialized at the rate we projected, but the recovery continues that is steady but more gradual rate as Murdo described for you. So we continue to build into guidance. The mid-single-digit net price declines in '21 and we've got other revenue at [Indiscernible].  The increase year-over-year driven primarily by the Lilly manufacturing reimbursement profit share, which began in the second quarter as we\u2019ve said? And so those are the dynamics around the top side of the guidance. Bob Bradway : I just Matt, I'd like to observe that relative to the beginning of the year when we gave the original guidance, COVID impact has lingered longer than, I think we thought when we looked at this at the beginning of the year, in particular in terms of the face to face visits and the number of patient diagnosis inside doctor's offices. By now looking through the retrospective scope, it's pretty clear that the surge had an impact on the number of patients going to see the doctors and in turn, prescriptions being written.  So I don't think we're experiencing anything different from our peers, but at the start of the year we were hopeful that vaccines and other things might have made us or enabled us to be further along in saying goodbye to this pandemic than I think we are right now. But again, otherwise, business is performing well and consistent with where we hope to end of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Alethia Young : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Maybe to follow up a little bit along with that. Can you talk a little bit about with Repatha and Aimovig, some of the selling price pressure you've seen and do you think that it's a slow step down or is it something that just will happen more periodically? Thank you. Bob Bradway : Alethia, did you say Repatha and Aimovig is that what you're asking? Alethia Young : Yeah. Murdo Gordon : Yeah. Okay. Sure. So Repatha in the quarter is more a function of what we've been able to do since lowering the price in terms of increasing our penetration in the Medicare Part D population. So we've seen some really nice growth there. But what happens when you grow in Medicare Part D is you also grow in the number of patients that enter the donut hole. And that's what we're really seeing in Q3, and we expect that to continue in Q4. The good news side of that equation is we're growing nicely in Medicare. We're seeing much less patient abandonment in Medicare. And that should be a compounding source of growth for us on a go-forward basis. But I would expect a pattern of Q3 and Q4, net price drag as a function of the Medicare Part D coverage gap, unless of course that changes in whatever is brewing in DC. But that's how it's happened right now. On Aimovig it's a little bit different.  It's just -- it's really the annualization of contracted business with PBMs in general. There has been fairly competitive activity there to maintain preferred formulary positions on national PBMs. And we don't have the same amount of volume growth on Aimovig, but we do expect that to be more stable going forward. So overall, I think our major price effects have stabilized and we're actually now seeing some good top-line volume dropped to the bottom. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Are there any color you could provide on the pace of enrollment for the Phase 2 study or pass and also any comments you could share, on how you anticipate the competitive landscape to evolve in the Lico Protein, any market with [Indiscernible] potentially getting approved before pasarin Thank you. Bob Bradway : Yeah, thanks, Jay. In terms of the Phase 2 study, it has actually completed enrollment. Of course these patients have followed for some time. And as I noted in my remarks, we expect data in the middle of 2022. We're quite pleased with the long-term follow-up we've seen from the Phase 1 trial in terms of Olpasiran lowering and the preliminary safety profile of the molecule. That program is on track, or if anything a little ahead of schedule. As you know there is another molecule ahead of us. We have a slightly different mechanism. As a small interfering RNA we like the molecule quite a bit. This is a large population of patients. If you recall that about 50% Murdo Gordon : Of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is not driven by LDL cholesterol and probably the majority of that is LP little a driven. So we believe there are many, many patients around the world that can be served by LP literally lowering agents. And so we're quite eager to see the full phase 2b data. Jay Olson : Great, thanks for taking the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny Gal : Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. So we typically ask you about the negative impact of a potential deal in Washington. I was wondering if we can reverse it and talk about the benefits. So to the extent there are any -- a deal which limits patients out of pocket costs, other drug will benefit from increased use here?  What other drugs will you see significant abandonment in Medicare Part D that might take -- might get more use. And second, you've started interchangeability trial for your Humira biosimilars. Can you just talk a little bit about your change of perspective here? Do you believe that interchangeability will be required longer-term to participate in this market and if not, what's the justification for the drug? Murdo Gordon : Thanks Ronny. It's Murdo. So hypothetically speaking, should there be an out-of-pocket cap for patients in Part D introduced in some change in legislation, I think it would help in our portfolio. We've been advocates for changes to Part D in that regard for quite a while, where we do think that the out-of-pocket expenditures and the list price equation for co-pays for patients are disincentives to drug appearance and maybe even for initial fill.  So I think products like Repatha, where we are largely a Medicare Part D population could benefit from out-of-pocket caps. Now, it depend obviously what that travels with. Does it travel with more commitment from the manufacturer in the catastrophic phase where we pick up more of the top, so it needs to be equated with other things that could be in any proposed legislation?  But I hope that out-of-pocket caps come into play because I think patients who are in Part D are sometimes treated poorly, and are sub optimally treated because of that. And it would improve their affordability.  To the question on the AMGEVITA interchangeability study, we continue to feel very good about our opportunity with AMGEVITA being in that first wave and potentially alone in the first wave of biosimilars launches to Humira in the U.S., affords us an opportunity to work with payers, work with the PBMs, and with providers to establish a leadership position.  We look at every parameter of bio-similar products and this is experienced from AMGEVITA itself in Europe, but it's also experienced from our other bio-similar portfolio. In the U.S. and we look at things like latex, Reese citrate free. We look at needle gauge, we look at device, and of course we look at interchangeability. So while we don't think it's essential, we think it's just another attribute of the product that could augment our success in that launch in 2023. So that's really why we've initiated the trial running. Ronny Gal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets. Sudan Loganathan : Hi, this is Sudan Logan Nathan [ph] on for Kennen. Thank you in advance for taking our question. So first I wanted to ask on LUMAKRAS, so how much of impacts are you expecting democrats having on the updated top end revenue guidance that you updated for 2021? And then taking into account any competition entering the market in 2022, how do you plan to formulate wherever we do guidance based on that for 2022?  And then secondly, in regards to the LUMAKRAS perspective, BICS third-line Combo program for colorectal cancer. Looking forward how this could -- what could this mean for Vectibix? If approved, do we expect some growth in that program if this combination gets through to approval?  And then thirdly, just wanted to ask about the antibody manufacturing agreement with a [Indiscernible] COVID-19. Is that still something we can expect to be included in the other revenue line item going forward, any updates on that, just based on the pandemic environment? Arvind Sood : Let's take the first question, and we can answer that, and the rest, call me later, this is Arvind from Investor Relations and we can address those questions separately. So maybe we can address the question about LUMAKRAS. Bob Bradway : I think it was [Indiscernible] Murdo Gordon : Yeah. Bob Bradway : -- Revenue and competition. Murdo Gordon : Yeah, more of a commercial question. We obviously don't provide product level revenue guidance, but I'll say this : I've worked on oncology for many years now, and I've been a part of some important lung cancer product launches. And this launch, after 40 years of trying to solve the KRAS G12C conundrum in lung cancer, this launch has been very special and the team has done an excellent job of executing across the payer customers, our provider customers, and of course, for patients and I was very proud of what our R&D organization was able to do in the speed at which they brought this product to market.  And I feel that the medical and commercial organizations have taken the customer-facing stage and the go-to-market stage of this launch extremely seriously and with a lot of responsibility, and so far, it's early days, but so far they've done very, very well. And so I'm pleased with the trajectory.  What we're seeing is many academic centers are changing their testing protocols in lung cancer so that everybody knows if their KRAS G12C status. Many large community oncology networks have done the same. Now we still have a few large community oncology networks to go. So we will be working on those in the fourth quarter. But I couldn't be more pleased with the way in which we've entered the market. And I think that bodes well for our ability to establish a strong leadership position and help many, many patients who are unfortunately progressing from first-lane into second-lane disease before competitors come in.  It's hugely rewarding to launch a product like this where you hear stories of patients who have been told that their options are limited and that they should sign up for hospice care coming at a hospice and getting treated with LUMAKRAS with commercial drugs and responding. And the drug is working well in the marketplace.  We're hearing those anecdotal stories coming back from prescribers and we will continue to do everything within our power to continue to launch LUMAKRAS quickly around the world and help many, many more patients. Arvind Sood : Right, thanks, Murdo. Erica, let's take the next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Robyn Karnauskas : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe a glass half empty one and a glass half full one. I'll start with the glass half empty. When I look at what's going on with your business, I mean, I think what we've heard on the call a lot is pricing pressure despite your growth and your great marketing strategy. And then you've got a pipeline that's got a lot of competitors that are going to compete with it, because there are a lot of people out there with either similar molecules or competing molecules. On that question is how -- any change in strategy for development and picking the next-generation R&D candidates going forward, or any tool kits or platform that you might need to develop a drug. And then the half-full question is, you have this great opportunity in [Indiscernible]. You did a great job with LUMAKRAS developing that drug. Can you talk a little bit about marketing strategy? Could you have competition here, but you could stay head of that competition with all the drugs that you're developing, walk us through -- remind us of the strategy at Amgen for making sure that you're the dominant player, even in a multi-player environment. Thanks. Bob Bradway : Maybe we just go in reverse order. Murdo, why don't you start and then Dave can finish? Murdo Gordon : Well, not to belabor the point, but again, I worked in the oncology field for a number of years and what I've seen since coming to Amgen is real strength in the legacy of Amgen, which is of course the supportive care products that we have. We've augmented that recently with the launch of our biosimilar portfolio and then most recently of course with the launch of LUMAKRAS.  And when I sit down with CEOs of cancer networks or academic cancer centers, they are very interested in talking to Amgen and they are also interested in talking to us about the very rich pipeline of products that Dave Reese and his R&D colleagues are developing. So I think we're very much a leader in oncology. I think that our commercial position with innovative.  Products and biosimilars and launches of new therapeutics put us in a very strong account position. And I think in a world where a lot of care is delivered in community oncology, our relationships there are extremely strong.  I've been able to make some customer visits this year despite some of the interruptions of the pandemic and most of my visits have been in support of the LUMAKRAS launch, and I can tell you they have been very, very good at working with us to develop testing programs, look back programs, entering flags and EMRs, making sure patients are flagged for treatment.  And it's those systems and those processes that being first on the ground, we should be able to build and sustain. Longer-term, of course, it will be the continuation of being first with indications and being broad in the development of the asset and then supporting it with additional products in lung cancer that Dave is developing in our pipeline. David Reese : Great. Thanks, Robyn. In terms of tool kits, we could obviously talk probably for hours about the tool kits that we've got in discovery, research, and our clinical trials. Let me focus on just a couple of things for the purposes of this discussion, we are building what I think is an industry leading capability and what I call human data. Which means the collection, integration, and interrogation of data ranging from various omic data? Genomic data, transcriptome data, proteomic data, through clinical trials data, through real-world evidence in real-world data. And it's one of our core belief that the coming few decades will be one by those who understand how to make use of, and in particular analyze for giant tsunami of data that is now starting to wash over us. Now that data of course generates drug targets and pathways. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are building extensive capabilities for the development of multi-specific molecules. Either small molecules, large molecules, or hybrid molecules. About 80% to 85% of the currently validated targets are currently not approachable with existing technologies.  And we are building the capability to go after what I think will be a good fraction of those undruggable target. So I feel great about the platforms that we've gotten [Indiscernible] and am continuing to build on a lot more on this over the next year or 2. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JP Morgan. Gavin: Hi, this is Gavin on for Cory. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe one for Murdo. Just curious about the expected impact of Tesla's mild-to-moderate label expansion. Specifically, should we expect an immediate uptake in 2022 or just something that will be a little more gradual?  And then secondly, just geographic expansion which underscores a key strategy for the growth profile for this product. And rest of the world has been around 20% of total sales there, just curious if that trend is going to continue. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thank you, Gavin. When we acquired Otezla, I thought it would be a really good adds to the portfolio and our strength in immunology both with dermatology and with rheumatology. And obviously we had to make a certain set of assumptions about how that product would evolve in our ownership. And so far I have to say I'm even more pleased with the strength that the product brings to Amgen. We've been successful as you highlight in demonstrating the product's efficacy and safety in the mild-to-moderate patient setting, which is a perfect sweet spot for this product, given the convenience of its oral dosing, given the well demonstrated safety and efficacy of the product. We also recently had a decision on the patent for Otezla, which definitely helps make a very strategic product for us, a very important product for the growth of the Company.  And the fit is just perfect. We have integrated the legacy Celgene team fully into Amgen. We've got both ENBREL and Otezla now being promoted in rheumatology and dermatology. And we've seen volume growth improve and most markedly in the last part of Q3, but that continue into Q4.  We didn't plan on a pandemic when we did the transaction obviously, but we've weathered it well, the team has sustained focus and we are well-prepared for the mild-to-moderate launch. We are anticipating a decision on that soon from the FDA. We have the resources available, we have the teams trained, and we have an increased footprint in dermatology in anticipation of the approval.  And we expect to ability to execute very effectively. We also have very, very strong payer coverage here and we think that the majority of these mild-to-moderate patients, and we're targeting a specific subset. We're targeting those patients that have larger body surface area or very difficult to treat areas with topical. That's about a 1.5 million patient population. It's a large opportunity, but we think that the profile of the product, the price point of the product versus biologics puts us in a very, very strong position to treat these patients. The other thing I would add that we expect to benefit from somewhat more so in the PsA area versus psoriasis, but the safety concerns of the JAKs right now, quite frankly, are helping Otezla and the overall perception of our safety and our efficacy. And I think that might bond well for future competition that's currently in the process I guess of being filed with the FDA. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter Gould : Great, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to change it up a little bit, I wanted to ask around the line extension strategy for tezepelumab and EOE, how you think about the attractiveness of EOE given that it's increasingly caught the attention of larger biopharma. And I guess alongside that, when your partner disclosed the orphan [Indiscernible] designation, they talked about a planned Phase III. Should that be the expectation that you'll move straight to Phase III versus doing some Phase II work here? Thank you. David Reese : Thanks, Carter. Eosinophil like esophagitis or EOE, as it's called in the field is an increasingly diagnosed condition. Patients with heartburn now who typically would've been diagnosed with Reflux over the previous decade, a fair number of those are now recognized to have [Indiscernible], given the mechanism of action of Tezepelumab, given what we've seen in some of our biomarker and tissue acquisition off studies in asthma, based on eosinophil depletion in target tissue. This makes a lot of sense, and that is why with our partners, we are carrying this forward into Phase 3 based on the Phase 1 data that we have generated. So I think the evidence package across the molecule here that supports that. Arvind Sood : Erica, as we're getting close to the top of the hour, why don't we take one more question after [Indiscernible] ask Bob to make some concluding comments. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim. Kelcy: Hey, this is Kelcy on for Michael. I thanks for taking our question. Could you maybe just discuss kind of your latest thoughts around potential accelerated approval opportunity in the front-line setting for lung cancer? And maybe when you might expect to have kind of a clear path forward one way or the other from the FDA. Thank you. David Reese : Thanks for the question. The FDA has Jim been generally clear that in the first-line setting, randomized data are required. We are, as I indicated, conducting a trial in patients with STK11 and/or PD-L1 negative or low tumors where checkpoint inhibitors are not particularly effective. When we have those phase II data available, Of course, if we saw interesting data, we would have the appropriate discussions with regulators. But I think the general expectation is that barring significant results, 1, we'll expect randomized trials in front line lung cancer. Kelcy: Thank you. Bob Bradway : Let me thank all of you again for you -- for joining our call and we look forward to having opportunity to meet with you in the New Year when we report on the fourth quarter. We obviously have a lot of exciting things happening between now and then.  Again, starting we expect [Indiscernible] expanded label for Otezla to be followed by the launch label for Tezepelumab, and the beginnings of a number of new Phase III trial programs, as we indicated on the call. So, exciting time for us, look forward to a gathering with you in the New Year. Again, thanks for your support. Arvind Sood : Great. Thanks, everybody.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call will be recorded.  And I would now like to turn the call over to Bill Slattery, Jr., Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications at ChemoCentryx. Mr. Slattery, please go ahead. Bill Slattery, Jr. : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to the ChemoCentryx Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. For those of you I have not yet met, I recently joined ChemoCentryx as Head of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications. My contact information can be found at the bottom of the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, providing an overview of our financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2021. The press release, along with a slide deck that you may find helpful while you listen to this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.chemocentryx.com. Joining us on the call today from ChemoCentryx are Dr. Thomas Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board; Susan Kanaya, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer; and Tausif Butt, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Tom and Susan will make introductory remarks before we open the call to your questions. During today's call we'll be making certain forward-looking statements. As explained on slide two, these forward-looking statements are based on current information, assumptions and expectations that are subject to change and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These risks are described in the company's filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 1, 2022.  You are cautioned not to place any undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and ChemoCentryx disclaims any obligation to update such statements. In addition, this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of this live broadcast, March 1, 2022. ChemoCentryx undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this live conference call. I will now like to turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Bill. Good afternoon to everyone listening. Thank you for joining us. Please move to slide three in our presentation. Today I will cover three important topics that highlight our recent success and outline the significant milestones we expect throughout 2022. First, we'll take a look at our progress in the early weeks following the U.S. launch of TAVNEOS in ANCA-associated vasculitis. Second, I\u2019ll update you on our plan to broaden TAVNEOS into our pipeline and our drug, including next steps that we expect to take at Lupus nephritis, severe hidradenitis suppurativa and C3 glomerulopathy. And third, we\u2019ll discuss recent progress we\u2019ve made and next steps for our unique, orally active, small molecule PD-L1, PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor CCX559 for which we expect initial Phase I data this year.  Moving to slide four, you can see that 2021 was an historic year in our corporate journey. After over 20 years since the founding of ChemoCentryx we've navigated the uncertain and uncharted territory at the frontiers of science, and achieved our longstanding goal of bringing our first medicine to patients, suffering from a devastating and debilitating disease.  Following FDA approval, we launched TAVNEOS as an adjunctive treatment for use in patients with severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis on October 18, leaving us 51 business days in the quarter r post launch. As we launched, we took a final step in our vertical integration. We now constitute and integrate U.S. biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and now markets innovative medicines of our own devising. It was a long and arduous journey to get here with some 17 years working on the TAVNEOS program alone. But the human rewards in bringing something truly different, to under serviced people, such as those enduring ANCA-associated vasculitis have made it all worthwhile.  January of this year brought another significant advance with the EU approval of TAVNEOS. This means that TAVNEOS is now approved in the U.S., in Europe and Japan for ANCA-associated vasculitis indications. Further European approval triggered a milestone payment of $45 million from our partner Vifor Pharma. We are pleased to share that Vifor launched TAVNEOS in Germany on February 15 of this year, with additional territories expected in the first half of 2022. As a reminder, Vifor will pay ChemoCentryx royalties in the teens to the mid-20\u2019s on ex-US sales of one aggregate net sales line.  Back to the United States as shown on slide five, we set out to develop our commercial infrastructure in the months leading up to approval, including the hiring and meticulous training of professionals in medical science liaison physicians, as a sales representative, and in other key roles. As we approached the launch, our initial marketing focus was multi-faceted by design. First and foremost, we sought to educate physicians on the TAVNEOS approved label and supporting clinical data, raising awareness through a hybrid approach of in-person and virtual meetings that provided flexibility in these times of COVID. Through our commercial team, we are initially focusing on the top prescribing physicians. We calculated that a combined field force of about 75 would sufficiently cover the approximately 3,400 clinicians, comprising key external experts, top prescribers and community specialists who collectively are responsible for roughly 80% of all ANCA-associated vasculitis prescriptions in the United States.  Further, we recognize the importance of working closely with patients, listening to advocacy groups and other active voices in the vasculitis community that it welcomed the arrival of a modern, orally administered and mechanistically targeted medication, which was designed from the start with their disease at mind. Too often orphan diseased patients seem to feel that they languished in a seldom visited treatment backwater, receiving occasionally repurposed drugs that may provide benefits to their condition, but were not designed specifically for that purpose. TAVNEOS was and is different. Now through branded campaigns we plan to educate appropriate patients on the TAVNEOS safety and efficacy profile, while also employing unbranded campaigns to provide disease awareness. These efforts are designed to support patients in having appropriate conversations with their healthcare professionals. Through these mechanisms we have activated a continuous positive feedback loop that will help inform our actions as we move forward, soliciting and obtaining prescriber and patient experiences in order to support continuous improvement of our commercial and outreach efforts. Let us now move to slide six. As we reflect on our first few weeks post U.S. launch. I am pleased to report encouraging progress. While the headline number is the top line revenue for Q4, which came in at approximately $1 million, including limited channel supply for our agreements with specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy selling TAVNEOS, we have stated before that we believe the best way to track our progress for the first few quarters is by focusing on three key performance indicators.  Specifically during the fourth quarter, these metrics include the following : We received 127 patients start forms or patient referrals from 102 unique prescribers. At the end of Q4, there were 90 patients on drugs and the conversion rate of patient start forms, to patient on drugs was 71%. The result in these key metrics, mark promising progress for a rare disease such as ANCA-associated vasculitis, especially when considering that the launch took place mid-quarter preceding a major holiday season and that was of course impacted by the arrival of an Omicron wave of COVID even before the Delta surge had finally end. As we move through the current order, which will eventually be the first full quarter of commercial activity. The leading indicators are favorable for our expected upward growth curves.  Moving to slide seven, we have superimposed the progress across key metrics from the beginning of the first quarter, i.e., through January. Accordingly, between the launch and January 31, we received 179 patients start forms from 140 unique prescribers and there were 141 patients on drug, representing the 79% conversion rate for patients start forms of PSFs. Since we are still at quite an early stage, I will also share with you today more largely qualitative color and context and we expect to give you a future quarters, when the qualitative - I'm sorry when the quantitative data will paint a more complete picture than it does today.  On side eight for example, let us look at some of the prescribing patterns that we are seeing. Through January 31, as it relates to what types of physicians are prescribing TAVNEOS we estimate 66% of the prescriptions are coming from Rheumatologists, 28% from Nephrologists and 6% from other treating physicians, such as pulmonologists. As it relates to where these referrals are coming from, while we are pleased with the traction across centers of excellence, we are particularly enthusiastic about the in-roads we made within the community setting as well. This success is in-part a testament to our commercial teams reach, supplemented by the unaided awareness of TAVNEOS that has continued to blossom, since the advocate trial pivotal results were initially released in the New England Journal of Medicine last year. We are also pleased to share that approximately 33% of positions are repeat prescribers, through January 31. We believe this suggest physicians are having positive first experiences, which we hope to continue to build upon.  Additionally, the time it takes to convert patients start forms, to patients on reimbursed medication is now tracking in line with our expectations, taking approximately four weeks to obtain a payer coverage decision, which we anticipate will continue to decrease over time. What's more, initial feedback from healthcare providers suggest that they are experiencing success now in obtaining reimbursements based on prior authorization, and if necessary appeals for appropriate patients who meet the criteria outlined in our FDA approved label.  As these patients await coverage decisions, we have provided mechanisms for immediate access to treatment for eligible patients through or support program. While we continue to support access per plan via such patient support programs, we are now seeing an ever greater share of paid models as the launch progresses.  Having launched into the unique environment, I\u2019m very pleased with our progress to-date. Apart from the obvious constraints on the availability of in-person as opposed to virtual visits, whether by our reps to physicians or by patients to physicians the Omicron wave led to staff shortages amongst healthcare workers, which in turn means that physicians continue to face capacity challenges seeing their patients in person.  We acknowledge that this is not a phenomenon unique to ChemoCentryx and in any case we plan for an orderly progression in the quarters following the launch, rather than a bold list of early patients which could have distorted the true growth picture. In short, we believe that TAVNEOS has the potential to become a blockbuster drugs at peak in our first indication alone. In the meantime, I look forward to updating you again in a couple of months when we release our full Q1 results. Let us now turn to slide nine, where we will look beyond our current commercial efforts. We have an exciting year ahead from a clinical development perspective as we aim to expand our patient reach by developing TAVNEOS as a pipeline and a drugs and also by advancing our novel-orally administered PD-L1, PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor known as CCX559.  In 2021 as you know, we prioritized and focused on ANCA-associated vasculitis approval. In Q4 we were busy building up a New World class clinical development organization led by Dr. Rita Jain who joined ChemoCentryx full time in October as our Chief Medical Officer, in addition to her role as Director on our Board, a position she has held since March of 2019.  Dr. Jain has enjoyed a distinguished medical academic and corporate career, and is an outstanding leader to take our development efforts to the next level. She will also oversee the post marketing studies on TAVNEOS in ANCA-associated vasculitis which is likely to yield useful supplementary data of interest to physicians and payers.  Moving to slide 10, the biological rationale for TAVNEOS across several underserved inflammatory and autoimmune disorders is compelling, given us unique ability to selectively inhibit the C5a receptor, preserving other functions and components of the immune system. I will remind us, TAVNEOS was designed to be an anti-inflammatory agent based on its mechanism of action and not broadly immuno-suppressant. Throughout 2022, our focus includes three indicating, lupus nephritis, severe hidradenitis suppurativa and C3 glomerulopathy.  First, we plan to meet with the FDA to discuss our plans for lupus nephritis, a disease in which uncontrolled complement activation has been implicated in kidney destruction. Once steps have been agreed upon, we anticipate initiating a clinical development program for TAVNEOS in patients with lupus nephritis in 2022. This should be followed in close order by another meeting with the FDA to discuss our plans for a pivotal Phase III trials of TAVNEOS in patients with severe hidradenitis suppurativa or HS, which we hope to initiate in the second half of this year. As you will recall, in our Phase II AURORA trial in HS, TAVNEOS showed a statistically significant improvement over placebo in a pre-specified subgroup of early stage 3 HS patients. To investigate and understand that clinical result, our research at ChemoCentryx has now provided evidence for clear differences at the molecular, the cellular and the histological level between more moderate HS disease for example early Stage 2, versus severe or early Stage 3 HS, a key differentiating feature appears to be a greater involvement of the C5a, C5a receptor access in early Stage 3 disease, versus milder forms of HS. Our data will be discussed at the upcoming dermatology conferences this year.  As for C3G, later in 2022 we plan to meet the FDA to discuss our accolade trial results of TAVNEOS in the very rare kidney disease or C3 glomerulopathy data from which we have here previously. The accolade trial with the largest, blinded randomized controlled study conducted to-date in this indication, and we are keen to review the effects demonstrated in this study with the FDA, such as the evidence for slowing of fibrotic progression indicated by the endpoint of the C3G histologic index of disease chronicity and other effects seen with TAVNEOS administration. We don't propose to invest in additional large scale clinical work in C3G in the absence of some defined path forward by which TAVNEOS might be used as this indication, due to the long and costly nature of such trials involving for example, serial kidney biopsies, at baseline at other time points, along with the challenges of patient recruitment in this very rare disease. We are hopeful that the data will inform a positive discussion with the FDA and this potentially life threatening disease for which there are no approved therapies.  Last, let me say a few words about CCX559. Our potent orally administered PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitor which entered first in human studies into Q3 of 2021. As seen on slide 11, after dosing multiple cancer patients, we can confirm that the drug is poorly absorbed well at levels that are approximately proportional to dose, and appearing generally well tolerated to-date. Additionally, a number of indicators confirm that immune cell activation is occurring.  Given the physical limitations of large molecules, that is anti-checkpoint antibody therapy example, which may not penetrate the tumor microenvironment well, a small molecule medication has the potential to establish itself in several niches in what many believe could be a fairly short time frame, providing a beachhead from which we could substantially expand clinical development on CCX559 in this very valuable area.  We plan to present initial data from the dose escalation phase of this CCX559 Phase I study in upcoming oncology meetings starting with the AACR in April and we expect to enter a phase Ib/II clinical trial in the second half of this year.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Susan Kanaya to outline our healthy financial situation heading into 2022, which is sufficient to progress our TAVNEOS launch efforts as expected for the [inaudible] activities. Susan? Susan Kanaya : Thank you, Tom. Our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results were included in our press release today and are summarized on slide 12. Total revenue for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2021 were $2.3 million and $32.2 million, compared to $4.4 million and $64.9 million in the same period in 2020.  TAVNEOS U.S. net product sales were approximately $1 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Product supply revenue contributed $1.3 million and $1.8 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 respectively. Collaboration and license revenue was $29.1 million for the full year of 2021 compared to $64.4 million in 2020. Cost of sales for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 was $302,000. Cost incurred from manufacturing campaigns initiated prior to the October 2021 FDA approval of TAVNEOS were recorded as research and development expense. Research and development expenses were $18.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $21.2 million for the same period last year. Full year 2021 research and development expenses were $83.0 million, compared to $77.9 million in 2020. These increases were primarily attributable to the manufacture of commercial drug supply in anticipation of the launch of TAVNEOS in ANCA vasculitis and higher research and discovery expenses, including those associated with the development of CCX559. Selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses were $23.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $12.7 million for the same period in 2020. Full year 2021 SG&A expenses were $78.9 million compared to $42.2 million in 2020. These increases were principally due to higher employee-related expenses associated with commercialization planning efforts and the launch of TAVNEOS in 2021. Net loss for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 were $40.5 million and $131.8 million, compared to net losses of $29.9 million and $55.4 million for the respective periods in 2020. Total shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021 were approximately 70.4 million shares. We closed 2021 with approximately $352.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. This year-end balance excludes the $45 million milestone for the EU approval of TAVNEOS received from Vifor in the first quarter of 2022. Lastly, for 2022 we expect to utilized cash and investments in the range of $120 million to $140 million. Tom? Tom Schall : Thank you, Susan. Moving to slide 13, before opening up to your questions, let me briefly summarize where we are. After a watershed year in which ChemoCentryx arrived upon the world stage as an integrated bio pharmaceutical company, we have positive feedback from the TAVNEOS launch and the leading indicators of further growth are favorable. We are focusing on our pipeline in a drug approach for TAVNEOS, aided by a world class clinical development function and have advances of lupus nephritis, severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and C3 glomerulopathy in our sites for 2022. CCX559 is progressing through Phase I with initial clinical data to be presented this year and we are in a strong financial position to execute right across the scope of our enterprise. As we join the ranks of commercially integrated U.S. biopharmaceutical companies. I am happy to report that the landmark here of 2021 has positioned ChemoCentryx well.  Our enterprise has traveled far to bring the benefits of medical innovation to clinicians and especially the patients that we serve. We\u2019re also aiming to provide returns for our shareholders. And as momentous as 2021 was for the company, we have only just begun. I will now turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Seedhouse of Raymond James. Your line is open. Ryan Deschner : Hi there! This is Ryan Deschner on for Steve Seedhouse. I just want to ask, if you guys can give us anymore quantitative detail on patient start forms or on the demand in general seen in the month of February relative to January \u201922. And then also, when do you expect to reach a majority proportion of paid scripts. Thank you. A - Dr. Thomas Schall : Yeah, so thanks very much for that question. So we're not providing progress beyond the additional month of Q1 just yet, but again to remind you through January the patient start forms reached 179; patients on drugs reached 141, representing almost an 80%, 79% conversion rate, and we had 140 unique prescribers. So I think we're quite happy with that conversion rate.  That\u2019s accelerating over where we were in Q4, which indicates to us that physicians are having success getting patients on therapy. We're also happy to see 33% repeat prescribers, which suggests to us that physicians are having a positive first experience. And further, we're \u2013 we see the time to coverage decisions are down now to approximately four weeks on average, and that's down from our initial expectation of four to six weeks. So all those indicators are going in the right direction and I think we're pleased with that.  We have an increasing number, an ever increasing number of paid prescriptions as we go forward, and again, we imagine that early on we were making an investment in the patient support programs appropriately to get eligible and appropriate patients on the drug as quickly as possible, with as few barriers, and we think that investment will pay off, and in future quarters I will tell you just how big that ever increasing percentage of paid prescriptions will be. Ryan Deschner : That\u2019s helpful, thank you very much. And actually if I can squeeze one more quick one in. How many scripts does each patient receive on average; sort of a one for three months\u2019 supply off the bat or how does that work? Thank you. A - Dr. Thomas Schall : So essentially we have one month\u2019s prescription and then we renew those. Ryan Deschner : Okay, thank you very much. A - Dr. Thomas Schall : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dae Gon Ha of Stifel. Your line is open. Dae Gon Ha : Good afternoon! Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019ll stick to one question, but a multipart one if I could if I may. So with regards to the separate, I guess your market research, 66% being Rhum\u2019s and 28% being nephrologists. I guess how are you thinking about marketing wise strategically targeting nephrologists to gain a broader following in that cohort. And also as you think broadly about sort of the feedback you were getting from both, rheumatologists and nephrologists, is there any kind of reluctance or more, I guess stronger affinity by one group of doc's versus the other? Thanks. A - Dr. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Dae Gon. Yeah, you know it's true we see more rheumatologists, maybe slightly more than we might have modeled. Having said that, these are very complicated patients and frequently they see more than one specialist, where \u2013 and again, not infrequently their primary doctors are rheumatologists. So even if they have kidney manifestations and are seeing a nephrologist, they will go back very frequently to the rheumatologist and as who writes \u2013 that\u2019s who is writing the script. So I think that that explains in part some of that predominance of the rheumatology part of the equation. Having said that, we're very keen on helping nephrologists as well understand the benefits of the drug. As you know published data suggests that it has a quite marked effect on eGFR improvements, and I think that as the experience in the nephrology community expands and we've already heard some interesting first experiences in nephrology cases and when you start hearing about those either peer-to-peer or at major upcoming meetings in Europe and the United States, I fundamentally think you'll get a lot more attention from nephrology. I\u2019d also say this, look, it's quite early days and this \u2013 the now, the preponderance of rheumatology script writer's versus nephrology may in fact be somewhat exaggerated at this early point. So we'll just have to see how that goes going forward. Dae Gon Ha : Tom, I'm really sorry. If I can squeeze in one more question, the January trend that you provided today does seem like there is some sense of acceleration in terms of PSS and POD\u2019s. So can you maybe speak to what you're seeing there and the dynamics and to what extent has omicron been still a headwind if you will as you commented two months ago at a competitor conference. Thanks. A - Dr. Thomas Schall : You're absolutely right. Look, I think the acceleration looks good. I mean in January alone what did we add, about 50 more patients start forms, so you have 152 and about 50 additional patients on drug just in January alone. Those are really good trends, right. So those things are things that I'm very happy with. Look, let's talk about COVID. COVID is and will be a major factor for all of us and for some time to come. No matter what happens with the current wave of omicron, even if it disappeared tomorrow, nothing is going to change quickly and how COVID has impacted how we can interact in clinical settings, not just we as sponsors, but patients and physician as well. So we can't be naive about that, that's for sure. Having said that, you know I think that despite launching TAVNEOS in Q4 into like a sub quarter and major holidays and the omicron emergence, I think we were really pleased even with the Q4 trends at the breadth of the TAVNEOS prescribers, which includes not just the so called external experts, but the community physicians as well, and yes, both in rheumatology and nephrology.  So look, it has impacted, COVID has and omicron has impacted certainly MSL access and Rep access to sites, especially at the large academic centers or centers of excellence. About 40% of our calls have been in-person and even in January so far with even a bit less than 40%. But that's okay; we planned for virtual visits to continue; we had planned when we were launching to have a hybrid approach. Our team has the tools needed to connect either in-person or online, so we hope that we'll be able to be providers when, how and where they need to be met. So I think overall we got the situation well in hand. Dae Gon Ha : Great! Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on all the progress. Dr. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Dae Gon. Operator : Thank you. Up next we have Michelle Gilson of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Michelle Gilson : Hi! Thank you for taking my questions. I guess Tom, just wanted to clarify, the numbers of patients on drugs, that's not necessarily patients on paid drug, right? A - Dr. Thomas Schall : No, that\u2019s correct. Michelle Gilson : Okay, and then\u2026 Dr. Thomas Schall : That would be all patients on drug at this point. Michelle Gilson : Alright, sounds good. And then, could you kind of walk us through you know the timeline of patients of the submission of start forms, to beginning of treatment, and then you know \u2013 did you give \u2013 I don't think I heard you give us any numbers on like kind of the average time that you're seeing reimbursement.  And you know could you also maybe Tosh, one for you. Could you outline for us your strategy around positioning and you know what your core messaging is to physicians around TAVENOS and selecting appropriate patients. Dr. Thomas Schall : Excellent timed question Michelle. Let's try to take it all in sequence there. So we have \u2013 you're quite correct. Patients on drugs includes all patients on drugs, including those that benefited from our patients spot programs and patient assistance programs. Now you will recall maybe from previous discussions that we had very carefully considered our plan to make sure we were trying to remove as many barriers as possible or early and immediate access to drugs for eligible and appropriate patients, those who are eligible and early, right. So that's why, early on we knew that the patient support programs, including patient assistance where there is the ability to get on temporary supplies of unpaid medication was so important, and one of the reasons that we continue to indicate that our metrics in the early quarters are most importantly patient start form, patient on drugs and conversion rate. And then that, the revenue line will lag a little while, but overall we believe that lag will be much higher because of these early investments through patient support programs.  So the number of paid folks as we go along grows and that's a trend we're seeing through Q4 and into the, as I mentioned \u2013 into the early parts of Q1 where we've analyzed the data quite closely. Now the time therefore to get people on drugs, again by design, is as we can provide that support and provide services to clinics and patients, can be very short, because again patients assistance can happen before the time that a decision is made on getting the coverage inactive, so that's important.  We have noticed again, that the time to getting coverage is now dropping as an average, it's about four weeks, but you know it\u2019s a wide range. It can be like basically the same day up to several weeks, but about four weeks. So that's a figure that I mentioned, and that's very reasonable because patient access and patient support programs are really designed around that sort of four week window at this early phase of the launch. So I think all of those are clicking in nicely with the program we designed and the metrics are coming out as if the performance in the real world is mirroring fairly well our model performance.  And Tosh, I will turn it over to you for the other part or parts of that question of Michelle about message points for HCPs, etc. Tausif Butt : Thank you, Tom. So Michelle, I\u2019ll have a crack at your question. So now in terms of positioning and patient time, first of all just to review for everybody. Our positioning and promotion is in line with our FDA approved label. So we are essentially talking to physicians about newly diagnosed patients and relapsing patients, as long as they are both severe and active and TAVNEOS could be an appropriate option to add to their existing standard of care and at the same time reminding them that TAVNEOS does not eliminate glucocorticoids.  In terms of the key messages, we try to keep it really straightforward and hopefully compelling to these physicians. We remind them essentially what we did in the advocate study, which is number one, we\u2019ve replaced the standard glucocorticoids that they utilize for these patients, and when we did that at six months we remind them that TAVNEOS was equivalent or not inferior to the standard of care, and at a 12 months this improved to superiority of the standard of care, and in addition of that there are a few other secondary benefits.  There was a reduction in relapsed rates, an improvement in kidney function as measured by eGFR, an improvement in quality of life, a reduction in glucocorticoid related adverse events, and all this achieved with an 86% mean reduction in glucocorticoids alone. That essentially is the nutshell of the story in 30 seconds. Now clearly we then engage into Q&A with those physicians, but that essentially is a message that we're focusing on. Michelle Gilson : Okay. And have you been able to engage a good number of physicians in that 400 top prescriber groups that you guys have outlined Tosh. Tausif Butt : Yes in terms of outreach, we have \u2013 though January we reached just under 60% of those top 350,000 customers and we continue to get more reach into the months of February.  And the top 400, yes we\u2019ve interacted \u2013 yes, we have interacted with the majority of those as you know, prelaunch with the MSL, and post launch with the MSL and our reps. Michelle Gilson : Okay. Thank you so much for taking my question. Dr. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Michelle. Operator : Thank you. And next we have a question from the line of Joseph Schwartz of SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi all! This is Will on for Joe. Thank you for taking our questions today and congrats on your recent progress. So one for us, from what we\u2019ve seen in our own K-world [ph] checks and as we saw in the metrics reported today, there are clearly some physicians who are very early adopters of TAVNEOS, which is great to see. So we're wondering what defines an early adopter relative to the later adopters and what do you think the later adopters want to see in order to prescribe TAVNEOS. Any thoughts here would be appreciated. Thank you. Dr. Thomas Schall : Yeah I, have some impressions. I guess I would say, let's just call them impressions we don't yet have enough data to have sort of granular evidence. But our early adopters, many of them were experienced with the drug in clinical trials. So they were very aware of the way TAVNEOS is used and has been used in those trials. They are very intimately aware of the advocate Phase III pivotal trial result and they are up-to-date on the findings that were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  So I would say many, though not all fit that profile. So I would \u2013 some, there is another group that is a little bit worried about in the era of COVID just how immune-compromised ANCA-associated vasculitis patient maybe as a consequence of their standard therapies, including B-cell depletion. So there are some that are wondering if TAVNEOS could have a role in helping these individuals particularly in a time of COVID and so there is a lot of outreach there. And then there's the third group, which again is a little \u2013 is a pleasant surprise at this point, early as we are in the launch. But these are the community physicians who have a great degree of unaided awareness about TAVNEOS and what the effects of TAVNEOS may well be for their patients with severe ANCA-associated vasculitis. So we see a healthy proportion from that group, and I think that that's quite encouraging.  Fundamentally I see a lot of interest in the Nephrology community, notwithstanding the \u2013 what looks like a somewhat skewing to rheumatologist being the prescribers in the majority of the script so far. But Nephrologists have been very interested and very vocal with some of their early experiences. So I don't know how public those are yet, but I hope that they'll be coming out in discussions at meetings for the Nephrology community in Europe and in other meetings to come and I hope you'll be hearing about some of those, certainly those case studies from some of the leading Nephrologists that have used TAVNEOS in their patients. And I think that sumps up most of my impressions. Unidentified Analyst : Great! Thank you. And if I could sneak in one quick follow-up. Are there any common questions that the sales force are getting or any kind of pattern here that you could talk about? Thank you. Dr. Thomas Schall : Well I think \u2013 sure, I mean this is a new drug. Clearly people are very curious about how to use it. The label is fairly broad and leaves a lot to the physician's judgment discretion. So physicians are asking questions such as, how do I use this with my current medication on this patient? How do I use it, do I need to start glucocorticoids or reduced glucocorticoids in context of prescribing TAVNEOS and essentially how do I get people started on TAVNEOS. So it\u2019s those kind of things that are questions about access as well and I think we've been able to address appropriately all those questions. Unidentified Analyst : Great! Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. And up next we have Yanan Zhu of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Yanan Zhu : Hi! Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the progress. So first of all I wanted to understand a little bit better the conversion rate for the fourth quarter. That 71% number obviously indicates a 29% of patients did not convert. Could you touch upon what might be the reason for patient not go on to therapy and then for the January number, interestingly I think as you alluded to, you have a 50 new patients starts form and then 50 more patients on drug, suggesting perhaps 100% of the patients have converted. Could you say whether that's the correct interpretation and what's your expectation for the conversion rate going forward? Dr. Thomas Schall : Well, all very good questions Yanan and thank you. You know some of it may just be from Q4, a timing issue. So there could have been folks that got patient starts sort of late in the quarter, and then spilled over into the New Year.  So I think what we're seeing is all these kind of rolling, basically rolling averages. So the lag time from conversion earlier, sometimes just talk is the question of again access, well early access was being worked out and refined, also while early discussions around coverage were being worked out, etc. So we expect and we have seen a reduction in the time from the original four to six weeks down to four weeks as people go into the system, and I think that's reflected in an increasing conversion.  I would hesitate to put a number on where we would like to be, but I can say that a conversion rate of around 80% is fairly good and you know most people that get on the drug are eligible for the drug, they fit squarely in the labeled indication, occasionally you'll get someone who either is eligible for the drug or cannot get into the system and even the patient access program is not suitable for them, and those are the reasons that you might have lack of certain conversions. Yanan Zhu : Okay, got it. Thank you. And if I may ask about any initial feedback on efficacy that you hear from the prescribers and how much of that 33% repeat prescribers do you think is driven by physicians seeing signs of efficacy. Thank you. Dr. Thomas Schall : Well, you know it\u2019s too early. One, I would hesitate to speculate. Secondly, I think it\u2019s too early to say about the repeat prescribers. Look, I think its good news obviously that we are seeing increasing numbers of repeat prescribers, and again that trend seems to be accelerating in the appropriate direction, so we are encouraged by that.  I am very much hoping that we'll start hearing some early reports on efficacy at the upcoming nephrology meetings, and I would hope that maybe you'll hear some things that you are. I don't know that as a fact, but I do know that a lot of the major players will be at the European, both European League of Rheumatology Meeting and the European Renal Association meetings in a couple of months.  And I would be very interested to hear what some of those folks have to say, because I know they seem to have some patients on therapy. So maybe we'll hear as early as that, maybe there'll be some letters about case studies coming up in the not too distant future. It's really more up to what the investigators decide to do and how they are going to disseminate their information. So I hope that we'll hear a lot more about that in the very near future. Yanan Zhu : Great! I'm looking forward to those information. Thank you, Tom. Congrats again. Dr. Thomas Schall : Thank you, Yanan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed White of H.C. Wainwright. Your line is open. Ed White : Thanks for taking my question. So you had mentioned this core programs Tom. I'm just curious as to the amount of free drugs given in the fourth quarter; perhaps the dollar value if you have it or the number of patients and then what your outlook is for the year. Thanks. Dr. Thomas Schall : Sure thing Ed. So we are not giving a lot of detail around the patient support and patient assistance programs. I think it's a little bit, it\u2019s a little bit early to talk about that. Sufficed to say, we have said we have said we made a considerate investment in patient support, patient assistance program, and I think that is paying off for us. I think we're seeing rapid access to drugs matters.  I will give you a little bit more granularity on this. So as we go through January, again, we're seeing an increasing amount of now patients on paid medication. Over one-third of the patients are now on paid medication and that number and proportion seems to be increasing, ever increasing. That is pretty much right in line where we thought it would be at this quite early stage of the launch, and we are happy with the trend line. Now, we will continue to support appropriate patient access, again with limited and temporary patient access to unpaid product, but again we think that's the appropriate investment as that ought to translate to an ever greater share a paid bottles as the launch progresses, and particularly as folks then get their prescriptions refilled and repeated and they work through the system. So I think we're right on track with where we want to be and I think the trend lines are well within our models at this point. Ed White : Okay, great. Thanks Tom. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Tenthoff of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Edward Tenthoff : Great! Thank you very much for taking my question. My congratulations too! Really impressed with where you are. In the long term I think it speaks to the profile of the drug. I wanted to get a sense a little bit for the patient experience. It maybe early, but I'm trying to get a sense for how quickly patients are feeling better, how quickly they can actually start to see some of these kidney function improvements, and there wereimprovements in the other organ systems. How quickly they can start actually \u2013 a physician will actually start to reduce the steroid dose. A lot of really good question, but I wanted to get a sense for sort of what the patient might experience on TAVNEOS. Thanks guys. Dr. Thomas Schall : Thank you very much. Yes, we know from our clinical work what we have been able to show in the controlled studies. Too early, and we don't have enough real world evidence, although we do have some anecdotes. But we know in our clinical work that we \u2013 for example if you just look at for patients with kidney dysfunction. If you look at the amount of protein in the urine, as measured in a variety of ways, but just say urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, we have shown in many \u2013 well, there are three controlled studies that we ran, and certainly the two were then called. Avacopan was used in the absence of that the daily scheduled oral prednisone taper.  You know we see a really marked reduction in proteinuria within a week, certainly by two weeks; significantly different from those persons that are only on standard of care therapy, which includes high dose prednisone taper. So that can happen within a couple weeks, and if you're a kidney patient with a nephrologist, you're probably being watched very carefully if your Glomerular Infiltration rate is degrading, because that really is the fear and you'll be first watched for proteinuria, may be doing that at home with a simple dip stick test.  So the patient is likely to see results in fairly short order if real world matches what the controlled trials helps. We also know in controlled trials that as a population you start to see an increase in estimated glomerular inflammation rate, which is based on the levels of Serum Creatinine, that's a question that starts with serum creatinine. So as serum creatinine goes down, then estimated glomerular filtration rate is going up. And what we see is, that can start happening quite rapidly as well, at least with population studies from the controlled trials. You know within about four weeks people start to see some inflections in there EGFR. I mean again, if your kidney patient that\u2019s super important. Now we've also heard about the reports and I think there's a couple of case studies where even a reverse trend of declining eGFR can happened quite considerably, more swiftly than that. So we\u2019ll be \u2013 I think there are some abstracts out there that have been published or accepted. It will be interesting to see more of those reports. So for the patients speaking to their nephrologists, those are all very encouraging signs and they can happen quite rapidly.  We know in terms of patient reported quality of life, again in the Phase II studies. You know even by four weeks we started to see improvements in patients sense of wellbeing, increased vitality. Certainly those were very firmly established by week 12 in the Phase II studies, week 26 in the Phase III study and continuing improvement out at week 52.  So in short, I think the data does support the idea that patients on TAVNEOS ought to actually feel better in fairly short order and whereas when they are on the totaled standard therapy, reporting, self-reporting any improvement in how they feel about their disease, is really rare and I don't know if there are many studies, controlled studies where it's actually been report. So I think that's going to be an interesting feature of the program. We\u2019ll see what the real world tells us in pretty short order. Edward Tenthoff : Great! Thanks for that color Tom. Dr. Thomas Schall : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And next we have Anupam Rama of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Anupam Rama : Hey guys! Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a quick one for me with some parts, which is you talked a lot about some of the dynamic for patient start forms, patients on drugs, you talked about some of the reimbursement trends. I guess specific to 1Q, how are you thinking about some of the seasonal dynamics around the order the quarter give, any growth in that, and it sounds like you have scripts being written for one month. Thanks so much. Dr. Thomas Schall : Yeah so, Tosh do you have feelings about the trends in Q1 in seasonal dynamics? Tausif Butt : I think its scripts related to one month. Typically they are approved for depending on the [inaudible] for a period of six months to one year. So we don't have any concerns about the scripting issued for one month.  In terms of trends into Q1, look as Tom alluded to or not really \u2013 Tom just shared with you, we launched to-date, as of end of Jan 31, you can see the continued acceleration that we see in January and we look forward to sharing more details of that acceleration in February and March at the end of Q1 earning. When we look at January launch to-date we are encouraged. Anupam Rama : Thanks so much. Dr. Thomas Schall : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I see no further questions in the queue. I will turn the call back over to Thomas Schall for closing remarks. Dr. Thomas Schall : Well, thank you very much and thanks everyone for joining our call today. Thanks also for the very stimulating and insightful questions and you may now disconnect. Bye now. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day!",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : My name is RJ, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's First Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background nose. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Okay, RJ. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our Q1 call. I think our performance in Q1 exemplifies our continued focus on execution while staying on track to deliver against our long-term objectives. So let's get started. Slides have been posted. Quick reminder that we'll use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to vary or differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. When we last spoke in February, we told you that we'd be focused on execution and that we have a number of opportunities in place that should enable us to deliver long-term attractive growth. In the first quarter of the year, we executed well on these many opportunities, delivering 6% revenue growth and 15% earnings per share growth. We achieved this performance despite the effects of COVID during the first two months of the year, currency headwinds, and of course, net selling price declines. The innovative brands that we highlighted in February continued to generate strong volume growth in the first quarter, including Repatha, which was up 49%; Prolia, up 10%; EVENITY, up 59%; and Otezla, up 7% as well as several of our oncology products, which also generated attractive volume growth in the quarter. Our two newest innovative medicines, LUMAKRAS and TEZSPIRE, are off to a strong start offering compelling new treatment options for patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancer and severe asthma, respectively. And we're also pursuing significant new indications for both of these products. Let me just say, with respect to the five high-quality biosimilars we have on the market, that they're performing well and in line with our expectations. As we've noted previously, growth for the portfolio of biosimilar products over time will come through the steady introduction of new products, including the U.S. launch of AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to HUMIRA in January of next year. AMGEVITA is the first of six new biosimilars that we expect to launch by the end of the decade. International growth is an important component of our long-term strategy, and we saw a strong volume growth outside the U.S. of 15% in the first quarter and nearly 30% volume growth in the Asia Pacific region. Turning to our pipeline. We're advancing, as you're aware, a number of mid- to late-stage potentially first-in-class opportunities in inflammation, oncology and general medicine while continuing to invest in our innovative marketed brands and biosimilars. Since our business review, we've had important data readouts for LUMAKRAS, Repatha and ABP 654, which is our Phase 3 biosimilar candidate to STELARA. We have several more data milestones that come through the remainder of the year. Looking to the longer term, we continue to thoughtfully invest in an integrated set of discovery research capabilities, including human data and generative biology, as we look to significantly expand the number of targets we can pursue, reduce cycle times, and increase the probability of our success. As to our commitment to innovation, we're committed to pursuing the best innovation available, whether it comes through our own efforts or is sourced externally, and our strong balance sheet and cash flows will enable us to continue to invest in innovation in both organically and through business development. Our work to serve patients comes at a time when society is confronting many challenges. We're doing our part to address these as we have throughout our history, with a focus in four areas : removing barriers that limit equitable access to health care, working toward a more adjusted society, minimizing our environmental impact, and ensuring that our actions and culture reflect Amgen values. If you're interested in learning more, our latest environmental, social and governance report was published earlier today and is available on our website. Before I turn to Peter, let me just thank my Amgen colleagues around the world for their commitment to serving patients and outstanding execution. Now Peter, over to you. Peter Griffith : Thank you, Bob. We're pleased with our execution and growth this quarter as we drive towards our long-term goal. I will walk through our first quarter financial results before discussing our 2022 guidance. The financial results are shown on Slide 5 of the slide deck. The first quarter marked another period of solid execution, with year-over-year revenue growth of 6% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 15%. For product sales, strong volume growth of 9% was driven by Repatha, Prolia and EVENITY. Volume growth was partially offset by declines in net selling price and foreign exchange headwinds. Our established portfolio comprised of EPOGEN, Aranesp, NEUPOGEN, Sensipar and Parsabiv, generated almost $1 billion of product sales and continues to deliver strong cash flows. Transitioning to our biosimilars, AMGEVITA remains the most prescribed adalimumab biosimilar in Europe. And looking forward, we will leverage this successful experience as we prepare to launch and grow this product in the United States in January of 2023. For MVASI and KANJINTI, as anticipated, we experienced year-over-year declines driven by net selling price reductions and we expect this trend to continue for these products. Murdo will discuss product sales in more detail in his remarks. Other revenues of $500 million increased 64% year-over-year, primarily driven by our COVID-19 antibody collaboration. First quarter, total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year as we invest in our pipeline, execute product launches and drive digitalization across the Company. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 1.1 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 16.6%, primarily due to higher direct manufacturing costs, COVID-19 antibody manufacturing costs and increased royalties and profit shares. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the quarter decreased 1% year-over-year. Recall that Q1 2021 included $53 million related to our acquisition of Rodeo Therapeutics. Excluding the $53 million for Rodeo in 2021, non-GAAP R&D increased 5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the first quarter declined 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments and activities and driving productivity. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were a net $413 million expense in Q1. This line item is driven by interest expense and our share of BeiGene results as a result of our use of the equity method of accounting. We have a strong balance sheet, generates significant cash flow and retain excellent financial flexibility to evaluate strategic business development opportunities. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, investing in the best innovation, internal and external; second, investing in our business through capital expenditures, including for our new environmentally friendly facilities under construction in Ohio and North Carolina; and third, returning capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including $1.94 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from Q4 2021; and fourth, opportunistic share repurchases, including 24.6 million shares of common stock in the first quarter, which included 23.3 million initial shares received and retired under the accelerated stock buyback agreement. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2022. We're pleased with our growth to date in 2022, and we're tracking to our 2022 plan. Accordingly, we're reaffirming our 2022 guidance with a revenue range of $25.4 billion to $26.5 billion and a non-GAAP EPS range of $17 to $18. This non-GAAP EPS guidance does not include upfront expenses that may occur from certain types of transactions in the future. Similar to our peers, we have updated our non-GAAP policy to no longer exclude such expenses from our non-GAAP results in accordance with guidance recently issued by the SEC. For reference, the only impact as we recast 2021 to incorporate this change is that our non-GAAP operating expenses will now include two items that were previously excluded in 2021. First, $1.5 billion recorded and acquired in-process R&D associated with the Five Prime acquisition in Q2 2021. And second, $400 million recorded in research and development related to an upfront payment to license rights to AMG 451 from Kyowa-Kirin Corporation in Q3 2021. Important additional points to consider for the remainder of 2022 : foreign exchange had an adverse impact on our Q1 2022 sales, and based on current rates, it is expected to create headwinds to our reported product sales of approximately $400 million year-over-year and has been included in our guidance. We note that while the results of our hedging program are reported in product sales, our hedging program is designed to partially mitigate the foreign exchange impact on our net income over the full year. In total, our 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% or approximately $0.35. We continue to expect other revenue for 2022 to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion. Q1 included a majority of our full year's projected revenue from our COVID collaboration and recall that these revenues in 2021 were recognized across Q2 to Q4. Our COVID collaboration revenue outlook depends on the state of the pandemic and continued government support. Our expectations for total non-GAAP operating expenses for 2022 are unchanged from the last time we spoke. However, when comparing against our recast 2021 results, total non-GAAP operating expenses will now reflect a low double-digit decrease year-over-year. We continue to expect 2022 operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50%. We continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 15.5% to 16.5%. Our expectations for non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2022 remain unchanged. Based on our recast 2021 results, in response to the SEC guidance mentioned above, which increased non-GAAP R&D expense in 2021 by $400 million, our expected 2022 non-GAAP R&D expense now equates to a decrease of 4% to 6% year-over-year. We continue to expect SG&A spend to be flat year-over-year as a percentage of product sales. And we now expect other income and expenses to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, reflecting increasing interest rates and our share of BeiGene's results. This is a change from our previous range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. And for the full year, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate range of 13.5% to 14.5%, up from our prior guidance of 13% to 14%. You've had an opportunity to read the update to our litigation and dispute with the IRS over the proposed adjustments for the period from 2010 to 2015, included in the press release. We firmly believe that the adjustments proposed by the IRS for that time period and the penalties proposed by the IRS of the 2013 to 2015 period are without merit. Further, the amount of the adjustments proposed by the IRS for 2010 to 2015 period overstates by billions of dollars, the magnitude of the dispute. We filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court in July 2021 to contest the adjustments previously proposed for the 2010 to 2012 period. And we plan to file another petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest the adjustments proposed in the notice for the 2013 to 2015 period. The dispute is expected to take several years to resolve. Amgen believes the IRS assertion of approximately $2 billion in penalties for the 2013 to 2015 period is wholly unwarranted. We've applied a consistent transfer pricing methodology since 2002. We've documented that transfer pricing methodology is required under relevant tax regulations, and have extensively discussed that methodology with the IRS across multiple tax audits over multiple tax years. The IRS has never previously proposed transfer pricing penalties. Amgen also believes, based upon the positions advanced by the IRS, that the IRS adjustments for the 2010 to 2015 period are overstated by approximately $2 billion due to the IRS failure to account for certain income and expenses. Amgen has reported its income and expenses in a consistent manner for many years, and the IRS has appropriately accounted for the Company's income and expenses in all prior audits. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the 2010 to 2015 period would be reduced by up to approximately $3.1 billion of repatriation tax previously accrued with respect to the Company's Puerto Rico earnings. Amgen previously made advanced tax deposits to the IRS, totaling $1.1 billion for the 2010 and to 2015 period. These deposits would further reduce any additional cash tax that could be imposed. The IRS is currently auditing the 2016 to 2018 period, -- we expect the audit to continue for several years, and it is possible that the 2010 to 2015 dispute will be resolved before the conclusion of the 2016 the 2018 audit and administrative appeals process. Any transfer pricing adjustments the IRS may propose for this period will be lessened by the change in tax rates resulting from the 2017 tax reform law, which reduced the difference between the tax rates applicable in the U.S. and Puerto Rico by approximately 2/3 beginning in 2018. We are highly confident in our positions in the litigation and dispute. We are grateful to all of our highly skilled colleagues in Puerto Rico and their important and ongoing contributions to Amgen's mission of serving patients. And now back to the mission of serving every patient every time. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen remains strong given the strength of the business and our outstanding and dedicated team of 24,000 colleagues that deliver every day for patients. This concludes the financial update. I'll now turn it over to Murdo. Murdo Gordon : Thanks Peter. First quarter product sales increased 2% year-over-year, we continue to progress our volume-driven growth strategy, which led to a 9% volume increase globally in Q1. We delivered record quarterly sales for Repatha, EVENITY and BLINCYTO; and double-digit volume growth for several additional products, including Prolia, KYPROLIS and AMGEVITA. In the first two months of year, COVID-19 affected our business in the U.S. and around the world as the Omicron variant led to diminished capacity in the health care sector and reduced working days for our own sales forces. In March and continuing into April, the impact of Omicron in the U.S. receded, which allowed us to engage in increased face-to-face customer interactions. Provider and patient activity have also increased leading to improvements in demand for our products. Now let me review some product details, beginning with our General Medicine portfolio, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and Aimovig. Overall revenue for our general medicine portfolio grew 19% year-over-year with 23% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 12% year-over-year. Volumes grew 10%, fueled by an increase in both new and repeat patients. EVENITY, which complements Prolia in our bond portfolio, had record sales of $170 million for the quarter, driven by strong volume growth across our markets. Moving to Repatha, the global leader in the PCSK9 class, Repatha sales increased 15% year-over-year, driven by 49% volume growth. And in the U.S., we saw 41% volume growth. Net selling prices declined as we offered higher rebates to support broad Medicare Part D and commercial patient access. Outside the U.S., sales grew 12% with strong volume growth coming from the inclusion of Repatha on China's National Reimbursement Drug List beginning January 1. We remain focused on increasing Repatha market penetration globally to address the significant unmet medical need in treating high-risk cardiovascular patients. Moving to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla delivered 7% year-over-year volume growth in the first quarter. In the U.S., we saw a strengthening of the market with Otezla remaining the market leader, achieving a 30% share of patients who are new to systemic agents for psoriasis. Otezla's recently expanded label has been well received by payers, providers and patients. We're seeing early signs of physicians using more systemic treatments for mild psoriasis patients, and the majority of dermatologists anticipate increasing the use of Otezla for mild psoriasis. Globally, Otezla sales decreased 5% year-over-year due to net price declines and lower inventory levels in the U.S. across wholesale and specialty pharmaceutical channels. Otezla net price declines in the U.S. were driven primarily by enhancements to our co-pay and bridge programs to support new patients starting treatment. Looking forward, we expect lower year-on-year price erosion for the remaining quarters of 2022. We also expect continued volume growth driven by broader adoption of Otezla, given our unique broad indication regardless of the severity of psoriasis. Enbrel sales decreased 7% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by declines in net selling price and inventory levels. Year-over-year, volume remained flat in the first quarter, supported by Enbrel's long track record of efficacy and safety. Our launch of TEZSPIRE is off to a strong start with $7 million in sales in the first quarter. Initial feedback from payers, providers and patients is very positive. Physician's unaided awareness increased to greater than 65% since launch, supported by our disease state education programs. On the access front, TEZSPIRE is a medical benefit product for which we expect permanent reimbursement coding as of July 1 of this year. Both allergists and pulmonologists acknowledge TEZSPIRE's unique differentiated properties and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe asthma who are uncontrolled or biologic eligible without any phenotypic and biomarker limitations. Moving to the hematology and oncology business, our six innovative products grew 17% year-over-year with 11% volume growth. We saw strong volume growth from KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO which we expect to continue throughout this year. XGEVA sales grew 7% year-over-year, while volumes declined 2%. Our launch of LUMAKRAS is progressing well with revenues of $62 million in the first quarter, representing 38% quarter-over-quarter growth. In the U.S., LUMAKRAS has been prescribed to approximately 2,500 patients by over 1,500 physicians in both academic and community settings since launch. While approximately 80% of patients in the U.S. are tested for their KRAS G12C status, the test result is not always available and/or reviewed when the patient progresses beyond first-line therapy. The opportunity to improve care is to ensure the KRAS G12C status is available in the patient chart or electronic medical record and reviewed by the oncologist to ensure that LUMAKRAS is discussed as an option for the patient. LUMAKRAS has strong payer coverage in the U.S., with 93% of patients having formulary access. Outside the U.S., sotorasib has now been approved in nearly 40 countries around the world with recent reimbursement approvals in the United Kingdom and Japan. Sales of our oncology biosimilars declined 25% year-over-year, while our biosimilars, MVASI and KANJINTI, both hold leading shares, we expect continued net selling price deterioration and volume declines, driven by increased and ASP erosion. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches beginning with AMGEVITA in the United States in January of 2023. Overall, we're executing well against our growth strategy with strong volume trends across our portfolio. With that, I'll turn it to Dave. David Reese : Thanks, Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. First quarter was one of continued execution in R&D where we focused on progressing our robust innovative clinical pipeline comprised of many potential first-in-class opportunities. Beginning with inflammation, we initiated two additional studies with TEZSPIRE in severe asthma. The WAYFINDER Phase 3b study, designed to demonstrate a reduction in oral corticosteroid use in adult participants on long-term oral corticosteroid therapy in the PASSAGE Phase 4 real-world effectiveness study designed to evaluate TEZSPIRE in adult and adolescent participants, including underrepresented populations such as Black Americans, smokers and patients with asthma-COPD overlap. Phase 3 planning continues for rocatinlimab, formerly AMG 451, an anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with heterogeneous moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Rocatinlumab binds activated pathogenic T cells expressing OX40. Its unique mechanism of action, rocatinlimab inhibits and prevents the expansion of activated pathogenic T cells and reduces their number. Thus, rocatinlimab has the potential to lead to profound disease control. In addition, this provides a rationale for longer dosing intervals, with the prospect of achieving disease modification. ROCKET, the comprehensive rocatinlimab Phase 3 program, remains on track to initiate in mid-2022. In our biosimilar portfolio, last week, we announced preliminary results from a Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 654 compared to STELARA, ustekinumab, in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The study met the primary efficacy endpoint, demonstrating no clinically meaningful differences between ABP 654 and STELARA. Now turning to oncology. Earlier this month, we presented data at AACR on outcomes from a two-year analysis of the LUMAKRAS CodeBreaK 100 trial, which demonstrated the long-term clinical benefit, including overall survival of patients with KRAS G12C mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with LUMAKRAS. These data showed that roughly 1/3 of patients were still alive at two years, and the prolonged tumor response was also observed with a 41% objective response rate by central review. While this was a single-arm trial without a control arm, the efficacy data compare favorably with anticipated outcomes in this patient population based on historical data. There were no new safety signals reported over the course of this two-year follow-up analysis. We have submitted data from the LUMAKRAS PD-1 combination and SHIP2 combination cohorts to a medical congress taking place in the late summer, while top line results from the LUMAKRAS confirmatory Phase 3 study versus docetaxel and the dose comparison study are on track for Q3 and Q4, respectively. Also in the lung cancer setting, we have submitted updated Phase 1 data of tarlatamab, our DLL3-targeting half-life extended BiTE molecule being used in patients with relapsed/refractory small cell lung cancer to a medical congress taking place in the late summer. And we plan to initiate DeLLphi-303, a Phase 1b study testing tarlatamab in combination with standard of care in first-line small cell lung cancer this quarter. Finally, in squamous non-small cell lung cancer, we are enrolling patients in a Phase 1b study of bemarituzumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against FGFR2b. Turning to gastrointestinal cancers. We presented data at the ASCO plenary series in February, where LUMAKRAS demonstrated a centrally confirmed objective response rate of 21% and disease control rate of 84% across 38 heavily pretreated advanced pancreatic cancer patients. We continue to explore the benefit of LUMAKRAS as a monotherapy and when combined with other agents in this setting. In third-line colorectal cancer, Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix is enrolling patients. In gastric cancer, a Phase 1b study of bemarituzumab plus oral chemotherapy regimens in tumors with FGFR2b overexpression has been initiated. In General Medicine, we were pleased to announce the results from two Repatha open-label extension trials, the FOURIER OLE, studies designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of Repatha in more than 6,600 high-risk adults with clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease on stable effective statin therapy. In the OLE studies, patients received Repatha for approximately five years, with some patients receiving Repatha for up to 8.5 years in aggregate across the FOURIER and OLE studies. The combined results from these studies reinforce the long-term safety and tolerability of Repatha in lowering LDL cholesterol. We are extremely encouraged by the sustained benefit of this medicine in patients with cardiovascular disease who still struggle to get their LDL-cholesterol level below the recommended targets. These extended results for patients on Repatha are consistent with what the health care community has learned over the past seven decades about the benefits of lowering cholesterol. That is robust and sustained LDL cholesterol reduction affects the spectrum of important cardiovascular outcomes. We look forward to sharing these data at a medical congress later this year. In conclusion, we continue to execute crisply across our innovative and biosimilar portfolios and look forward to sharing new data from a number of our programs throughout the rest of the year. With that, I'll turn it back to Bob for Q&A. Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Dave. RJ, could you remind our callers of the process for submitting a question, we're happy to answer questions now. Operator : Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Your line is open. Michael Yee : Can you hear me okay? Bob Bradway : Yes, Mike, go ahead. Michael Yee : Very good. Question for Dave. Obviously, the KRAS field is quite competitive and you have a very important Phase 3 LUMAKRAS confirmatory study reading out. I just wanted to know your confidence around the expectations for a positive result there against docetaxel, how fast you could file that and whether that changes the paradigm for accelerated approvals for competitors around you. So maybe just comment on that study and the ramifications. David Reese : If we replicate what we've observed so far with LUMAKRAS, I think, Mike, we would be quite confident in the likelihood that the Phase 3 trial against docetaxel, which, of course, has been around for decades, will be positive. We would, of course, discuss with the FDA and other regulatory bodies, how to file these data and move forward with full approvals in terms of effects on the competitive landscape. I'll leave that to others to comment on. But we're very confident in LUMAKRAS at this point. We're approved in roughly 40 countries around the world. The program is moving forward very briskly, and that's our focus right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jay Olson : As you continue to generate important new clinical data for Repatha, data coming for Olpasiran, AMG 133, I saw you recently published data for AMG 986 for heart failure. It seems like you're building an increasingly strong cardiovascular portfolio. Can you just talk about your strategy in cardiovascular disease? And what are the large opportunities there? And are there any gaps in your cardiovascular portfolio where you may want to pursue business development opportunities? Bob Bradway : Why don't I take the last piece of that, and Dave, why don't you respond to the first? I'll start. I think Murdo wanted to comment as well. Good. Jump in. Thanks, Jay. I think you raised an incredibly important question. As you're all aware, cardiovascular disease is one of our three principal areas of therapeutic areas for research. It remains an area of focus for us going forward. It remains the number one public health burden in terms of morbidity and mortality across the globe. And that, in part, is what spurs our commitment here with Repatha. Murdo will comment in a minute, but we believe there is tremendous opportunity to serve patients on a hypothesis that's probably the best proved in medicine in terms of LDL cholesterol. You mentioned the LPa program, Olpasiran, or AMG 890. Just to remind everyone, LPa is probably the single most important driver outside of LDL cholesterol in terms of the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. As I noted, we're looking forward to over the next couple of months, Phase 2b data in those programs. And our goal would be to transition Phase 3 as quickly as possible if those data replicate what we saw in Phase 1. In addition, we have a very active preclinical research portfolio, I think, indicating our ongoing strategic commitment to this area. Murdo, maybe I'll turn it to you next and then Bob can talk about the business development. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Dave. Underpinning, obviously, the huge unmet medical need of cardiovascular disease is our ability to reach that global population of patients, and we've built the medical and commercial capabilities and global footprint to support that business. We reported 49% volume growth on Repatha, 15% sales growth year-on-year. So we clearly have momentum now, and we continue to feel that there's more for us to do for these patients. We're also very clear that we are focused on improving the affordability of our medicines for these patients. And I think that that's another area we've made great progress. So adding to that portfolio with our own internal pipeline is a welcome thing. And I think Dave's team is working very hard, not only on the pipeline assets, but also to improve the profile of Repatha with the VESALIUS trial, which is ongoing. And of course, the recently announced long-term follow-up trials that were continued, so the profile of Amgen in cardiovascular disease is strong. And I'll turn it over to Bob on the business development. Bob Bradway : Yes. And there, it's very simple, Jay. We've challenged our business development and research teams to find attractive innovation externally that we can add to our portfolio. So we're looking for things that we can add value to every day in cardiovascular disease as well as in inflammatory diseases and in cancer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Goeff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is open. Geoff Meacham : Peter, a lot more commentary on the tax dispute with the IRS on this earnings call compared to when you first talked about it last year. I think probably a higher number of the investors expected. So the question is, has there been a recent discussion with the agency or the service that prompted broader language today? And I know it's going to take years to fully resolve, but would you expect your tax reserves to change over the course of that discussion? Or is that just something that's going to be a stagnant number? And then when you fully resolve it, then you'll appropriately make that change. Peter Griffith : Yes. Goeff, thank you for the question. Look, we wouldn't -- we're in litigation, so we wouldn't comment on discussions with the IRS first. And then secondly, on reserves, as you can understand, we don't comment on where we're at in terms of the size of the reserves other than we would just simply say that we're very confident in our position and the level of reserves that we've established. And as we said, this is about Puerto Rico and the allocation of profits between the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where we perform a majority of our global manufacturing. Puerto Rico is home to our flagship manufacturing complex, 30-year presence, 2,400 -- 2,400 highly skilled employees, over $4 billion in capital investments. And as we said, we believe that the IRS positions are without merit. We're going to vigorously contest those adjustments proposed for 2010 through 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Salveen Richter : On LUMAKRAS, what steps can you take to ensure that G12C status is recognized by physicians to drive prescriptions here? And could you also frame the outlook for the combo study with KEYTRUDA that's reading out in late summer? Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Salveen. Maybe I'll start and then turn it over to Dave on the data question. We're obviously working extremely closely with all of the oncology providers to improve their own internal systems, whereby they have that KRAS G12C status with literally fingertip ready for making treatment choices for their patients. What we are seeing is a little bit of a COVID hangover effect. Many of these large oncology networks in the U.S. are short staffed and constrained in the resources that they can deploy against things like EMR enhancements, against things like better workflows for diagnostics and biomarkers, particularly new biomarkers. So we are working literally account by account across the country. We've made huge improvements, and we've seen some very large community oncology networks, which is where 80% of the patient base is treated. They're treated in the community centers. I think in the academic institutions, the testing is very strong, robust. The care is clear, and the test results are available for patients who progress. So it's really in the U.S. community setting where we're working. As we look ex-U.S., we see a different pattern by country. So countries that have advanced biomarker technology and very clear systems like Germany and France, we expect good uptake there and we're already seeing early indicators of that. France, as you may recall, has an early access program called an ATU program where we can actually charge for the product and that's being used already fairly broadly. And in Germany, we're just launching and a few weeks old as we are in Japan. So I think it's a network by network project that we're working intensely with our medical colleagues, with our commercial teams to make sure that no patient slips through. Dave? David Reese : And Salveen, thanks for the question. In terms of data availability, as we noted, we've submitted the data for one of the summer oncology conferences. We are looking at both combination and sequential approaches with PD-1 inhibitors. I'd also point out that one of the things we're beginning to examine is the whole population of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. You can divide them roughly into 1/3 are PD-L1 negative tumors, third have load intermediate PD-L1 expression; and third, have high PD-L1 expression. In the PD-L1 negative population, for instance, the effect of checkpoint inhibitors is quite modest, and that's an area where we are looking at combinations of LUMAKRAS with straight chemotherapy. So, one thing to keep in mind, as this field evolves is that depending on PD-L1 expression, the approach clinically may vary as well. And we are crafting our development program accordingly. Arvind Sood : RJ, let's take the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Matthew Harrison : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon I was hoping a question for Murdo. Murdo, can you just maybe comment know you commented a business review around your thoughts around contracting and specifically biosimilar contracting as we think about both the HUMIRA launch and some of the other products. Any updated thoughts in terms of how that's going or your expectations on specifically HUMIRA for 2023 versus 2024? Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Matthew, for the question. No, I don't really have a lot of new information to update you on. We continue to feel like we're extremely well positioned for the opportunity to be among the first, if not the first, and potentially only biosimilar for a period of time in the market in 2023 as of January 31. We like our profile competitively given that we -- as you'll recall, we use the existing inflammation commercial organization that currently commercialize Enbrel and Otezla that have relationships intact with rheumatologists and dermatologists. We actually have a GI footprint as well supporting us solo. So, we feel that we've got the customer relationships. We definitely have the payer relationships. We have obviously 40 years of biologics manufacturing and supplying every patient every time to provide the confidence for pharmacy benefit managers to make the decision to make our product available as early as possible. So we're excited about the opportunity. And then, of course, after the launch of AMGEVITA in the U.S., we have several other launches, STELARA EYLEA, Soliris and then additional launches thereafter. So, six new biosimilars coming into the market, so this is an area where we're very focused. We've invested in this area. It's important to us for our long-term growth, and we have the capabilities in the market to ensure success. Arvind Sood : Let's go the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Yaron Werber : Great. I guess, Peter, maybe for you and for the rest of the team. I guess, Peter, for you, first, the tax rate is increasing incrementally this year. Is that relating to the ongoing litigation with the IRS? Or is that for different reasons? And then maybe, Murdo, for you, the U.S. LUMAKRAS is growing, but it's going poll lower than we expected. Are you expecting ex-US to be bigger or similar in size to the U.S.? Peter Griffith : Yes. Let me jump in first here. I don't think Murdo wants to take the tax part of that. So look, we're only moving it up by 50 basis points. Yaron. It's not related at all to the tax litigation. And just maybe that highlights the point that I should make in response to Goeff's good question a little bit earlier, which is why more commentary now. I think this is exactly why, because this is a complicated area for all of you, for the analysts. And we want to make sure you understand our position. We think that it's been a struggle to understand for folks, this just prior conference calls. So we just want to be more specific on it. But in the case of that question itself, it's not related at all. And again, Yaron, thanks for the question. We're confident in our position in the level of reserves where we're at. But we're wanting to provide some more background for you on it. So hopefully, that's helpful. And now I'll turn it over to Murdo to get back to business. Murdo Gordon : Thanks Peter. You're on. I would say in the U.S., what we're seeing with LUMAKRAS is when that KRAS G12C status is known at the point of progression from first-line treatment to second line. We're getting over 80% of those patients to be treated by LUMAKRAS. So we're penetrating the population when the identification of the KRAS G12C status is there. So that's clearly the lever that we need to ensure improved. And as I answered Salveen's question earlier, this is really an account-by-account book of work. And we're doing it with urgency because we really can't have patients progressing from first line to second line and not have the choice of LUMAKRAS. So this is really important work that we're doing for patients. When we look at the epidemiology of disease in the U.S. versus ex-U.S., I would say that the overall incidence of non-small cell lung cancer is similar between the U.S. and Europe in terms of size. Now one thing just to think about as you go into Asia, as the incidence of KRAS G12C mutational status is a bit lower. If you take Japan as an example, it's about 4% of patients who have non-small cell lung cancer that also have a KRAS G12C mutation compared to 13% in the U.S. So, the mutational epidemiology does change a little when you go outside of U.S. and Europe. So, we would expect the business to be slightly bigger in the U.S. than it will be in Europe and rest of the world. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Umer Raffat : I guess two, if I may. First, perhaps on KRAS. There's an interesting disclosure on the slides on how 2,500 patients have taken it in U.S. commercially. And third-party data sets would suggest perhaps 1,200 patients were on the drug in March. And I'm trying to square those two. About 1,200 patients were on therapy in March and 2,500 is total exposure. Crude math would suggest that duration of therapy has tracked five-ish months or so. Is that consistent with your observation? And then secondly, Peter, on the tax court side, can you guide us through what the time line could look like because I feel like this is one of those topics? Now there's a -- two sets of liabilities that people will put in their model somehow at certain probability and having a sense for what the time line could look like for resolution, or at the very least, on when the hearing is or when a key core dates coming up on the tax code, that would be very helpful. Murdo Gordon : Yes, perhaps on the first question regarding patient numbers and duration of therapy. I think it's a little bit premature to be able to draw conclusions from numbers on drug versus numbers treated to get to DOT or duration of therapy. What you need to understand, I guess, in the 2,500 patients is we've got a combination of patients who were very late-stage disease, third line and beyond potentially who were challenged with the product and didn't do very well. Whereas the steady state will be more second-line patients having experienced maybe one prior line of therapy who could do quite well as indicated by the long-term follow-up data that we just put out at AACR, where you see about 1/3 of patients being alive at the two-year follow-up mark. So I think it's too early to infer from existing in-market patient numbers to understand what the effective duration of therapy will be. And in fact, I often say this is you really actually need 24 months in market to understand what your look-back period is to understand what your duration of therapy is. So it's going to be quite some time before we know what our real-world duration of therapy will be. Peter Griffith : Peter here. So, on the tax side, thank you. In terms of next steps and time line, we will be filing a petition with the U.S. Tax Court within 90 days. And as I mentioned, we will vigorously contest 2013 through 2015 notice through the judicial process. We plan to see consolidation of the 2013-2015 period with the ongoing 2010 to 2012 tax court case. And as I said, it will take several years for this to resolve itself. So that's the current time frame as we see it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays. Your line is open. Carter Gould : Maybe to focus for a second on TEZSPIRE. I was looking to get a little bit more color there, specifically how you think about the importance of the J-code there and the extent that could drive an inflection in sales and I guess to the extent that's been an impediment to date. And then obviously, you started WAYFINDER recently. In the past, you guys kind of talked down the importance of the source results. So as we think about WAYFINDER, is that sort of critical in addressing that gap or simply nice to have some color there would be helpful. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Carter, on the question regarding TEZSPIRE. We're really excited about the market response to TEZSPIRE by having such a novel, unique product where the profile really simplifies the treatment of severe uncontrolled asthma, particularly for pulmonologists who have so much else to do, that they're looking for a simple solution that can treat their patients without being limited by phenotypic or biomarker status. So overall, we think it's going really well. It's clearly a benefit to have a permanent J-code in the market, which, as I mentioned, will be coming July 1. That gives confidence to providers and to their billing staff that they can code the product appropriately and have a high degree of assurance on reimbursement. I think they know the reimbursement is happening now, but it's also tied to reimbursement for some of these practices. Some of them run pretty tight cash flows. And knowing that the permanent J-code should expedite the time to reimbursement will actually help. So yes, I'd say it's going to be helpful. But I would say the in-market response currently is really good. And we're clearly providing product to patients who are going through that reimbursement step in that process so that they can get on therapy and have access to the medicine. But yes, we'd be looking for additional sales force -- sales growth in the back half of the year. David Reese : Yes, Carter. And in terms of WAYFINDER, this trial, we believe, will address some of the methodologic limitations. We believe we saw in the SOURCE trial. The sample size is much larger. It's a single-arm trial, sample size over 300 patients. Patients can be on a higher dose of steroids. There can be a more rapid corticosteroid taper. And we're looking at the effects earlier at earlier time points. All of these, I think, give us confidence that we will see effectiveness of TEZSPIRE in the setting of lowering oral corticosteroid use. In addition, we presented recently at the Quad AI meeting updated data from NAVIGATOR and other trials showing a very profound reduction in exacerbations in patients on oral corticosteroids. Again, I think this is going to be a really important drug for the treatment of asthma across a range of phenotypes, and we're quite confident in the development program going forward. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Truist. Your line is open. Robyn Karnauskas : So just a couple on Repatha. So just your thoughts on inclisiran with the permanent J-code coming in July and your thoughts on the impact on Repatha in the second half of the year? And then just a second, you have impressive growth with Repatha. Maybe you could give a little bit more color on script trends by doctor. Are you seeing more scripts by cardiologists here some trends that give you confidence that, that growth can continue as far as who is prescribing the drug versus I think previously in the early days, it was lipidologist mailing. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Robin. We are pleased with the evolution of Repatha. The growth is actually fairly consistent across the broad cardiology community. So it's not just your podologist, a variety of cardiologists. We're seeing general community cardiologists. We also have a large effort focused on integrated delivery networks and hospital systems where we have been successful in establishing a more standardized way of treating the some 25 million high-risk ASCVD patients in the U.S. that end up in an acute care facility for their MI or other events that they've been admitted for. And unfortunately, many of them don't even get a lipid panel, and many of them get discharged without appropriate recommendations or initiation of treatment. So we've stepped that up quite a bit, and we're seeing improvements quality of care. And those patients are being discharged then to the community cardiologists and/or primary care physicians with clearer intent on more aggressive lipid-lowering therapy or cardiovascular risk reduction. So that's definitely helping. For future growth, we're obviously going to continue that effort, and we're going to continue to expand that IDN work that we're going to do in the U.S., but we're also going to invest incrementally in primary care, given that we're seeing some spontaneous prescribing with primary care. So we're very pleased with the growth of Repatha. Ex-U.S., the other thing I would mention is we got the Jan 1 listing for Repatha in the China National Reimbursement Drug List, which has been a good launch for us there. And our team in China is doing a nice job of ensuring that Repatha is an option for high-risk ASCVD patients in that country. So really, I think we've got a large amount of headroom for growth on this product. there's a large patient population, and we've got good momentum now in cardiology, and we need to continue to build that into primary care and around the world. With respect to inclisiran, obviously, they're a competitor in the market. But given that they don't yet have event reduction data, even with reimbursement coding, I think they're still limited in what they can promote. But again, there's tons of patients out there that need more aggressive lipid-lowering therapy and more aggressive cardiovascular risk reduction, and we see that the market can bear a lot of people talking about this severe disease, the number one killer in the world for everybody that's concerned about patients and what we can do about it. So overall, we're still very bullish. Bob Bradway : RJ, I know we've got several colors still hoping to ask questions. And I just want to give the callers heads up that we'll probably go a few minutes over the top of the hour. So, why don't we take the next question, and we'll do our best to get to everybody? And if we're unable to do that, then we'll, obviously, Arvind and his team will be available later. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Mohit Bansal : Maybe a question on TEZSPIRE. So given that right now, it needs to be administered by a provider, do you -- what kind of reservation do you expect from the doctors at this point in terms of prescribing the agent, given that Dupi is available for self administration. And the question is, is there a possibility in the future that you could come up with a self-administration injection, which could actually help it become a self-administered at-home product. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Mohit. Unfortunately, because severe asthma, especially uncontrolled severe asthma is such an acute condition, many of these patients are under frequent care of a pulmonologists that are an allergist. And so they're seeing their physician on a very regular basis. And I think given our very convenient once month dosing, it's seen as a fairly easy product to administer. And of course, it's early days in the launch, but the feedback has been that the physician administration is not a barrier to initiation of TEZSPIRE. And allergists, in particular, are used to physician-administered products. What I think the benefit side of this is really playing out is that they have much less work to do on the biomarker side or the phenotypic assessment side. And so we've simplified their workflow in that regard. I do think over the long haul, we'll continue to evaluate what we need to do to ensure that there's convenience and maintenance for patients. And obviously, we're looking at other indications and other life cycle opportunities for test buyer. So we'll continue to assess whether or not we want to provide a self-administered option. I mean, clearly, the product could be developed that way, and we continue to look at that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dane Leone from Raymond James. Your line is open. Dane Leone : Congrats on the quarter. One question for me. Presuming the dose equivalency study of LUMAKRAS actually demonstrates that 240-milligram Q-day is equivalent to 960. How are you playing on managing that transition at the end of the year? And the reason we get this question a lot from investors is, obviously, that will coincide with the presumable launch of a competitor in the KRAS G12C space. Maybe to frame it, just from a script being given 30-day script being given at the end of the year, if this dose equivalency does show that lower dose is equivalently effective, that 30-day turns into a 120-day script? Just how is your team thinking of managing this? And is there any expected change to pricing that would be enacted if the lower dose is seen as equivalent? Murdo Gordon : Yes, it's a pretty detailed hypothetical. What I would say is, first off, we remain confident that the 960-milligram dose is the right dose. And clearly, the safety and efficacy benefit of that product looks very good. And given the long-term follow-up data, clearly, it's a high bar for us to be able to see if it can be approved upon at a lower dose. So that's the one question that remains to be answered. The way, I guess, I can't directly answer your question because there's so many different complicated variables to it. But what I would say is, we continue to look at the best way to provide the right treatment for continuing patients. So if you're a second-line non-small cell lung cancer patient, you've been prescribed LUMAKRAS at 960. You're taking it, you've responded and you're stable. I'm not sure any oncologist is going to want to lower your dose, if you're a continuing patient. Now we've seen that in other disease areas where there might have been a dose change either to go up or to go down, where patients who are on a stable dose usually stay on that. So that would be my one bit of additional commentary to your question. But we'll wait and we'll see the data and we'll handle it according to what the data say and what the FDA guys us to do. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Evan Seigerman : I wanted to ask one from Murdo on Otezla now that we have the full label or kind of the full spectrum approval as of last December. So have you seen any sort of barriers for the more mild patients do these patients need to go to any sort of step edits or are they able to get it pretty freely? Do you expect that to change over the course of the year? Just love to get some color on how you're pushing it or marketing in those patients. Murdo Gordon : Thanks for the question, Evan. No, we're really pleased with the response from payers and PBMs to ensuring that the expanded label now regardless of severity of psoriasis the patients can have strong access and good affordability for the product. In fact, we've actually improved access this year versus last year. So, we've been able to produce some of the prior authorization criteria, things like percentage of body surface area. There are there are some medical policies of prior authorizations where that's described as a percentage. We've had many of those removed. So we've actually opened up access for those patients. And I think that year to prescribe Otezla for that milder patient. I was at the American Academy of Dermatology meeting in March and spoke to many dermatologists and asked them what their prescribing experience was like and what the reimbursement experience was. And I think many of them played back to us that Otezla was easier than it had been in the past to prescribe for that milder patient. The other thing we did was we enhanced our co-pay systems and our own bridging programs to ensure that, that launch would go well. So far, so good, off to a good start, but I don't anticipate access being an impediment. Arvind Sood : RJ, in consideration to the folks on the East Coast, it's past the hour. So why don't we take two more questions, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Gavin Scott : It's Gavin on for Cory. I just had a follow-up from a question earlier in the queue on LUMAKRAS pembro combo data late in the summer. I guess just of the lung cancer patients, can you remind us if this is predominantly second line plus? Or will there be sufficient patients in the front line to assess the pathway or a path forward? And then should we also look for multiple doses and/or different dosing administration. I think you've discussed in the past sequential dosing versus other strategies. David Reese : Yes. Thanks, Cory. Most of those patients will be second line and beyond. Maybe there is a limited experience in first-line, and we are looking across a range of doses with both combination and sequential therapy. So you can expect to see all of that when the data are presented. Bob Bradway : Let's take one last question, RJ and after the Rob, just going to make a couple of concluding comments. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow from UBS. Your line is open. Colin Bristow : I'll keep this quick. Just quickly on the tax issues. Could you just talk about whether we should view this as being essentially limited to 2015? Or is there scope for this really to permeate through to effectively 2021? And then just quickly on LUMAKRAS, there was a small investigator-led data set presented at ELCC a few weeks ago. We saw some relatively high rates of LFT elevations with LUMAKRAS dose in closed sequence with PD-1. I was just curious how this compares to your own experience with the combo versus sequential dosing. And anything else you can say about the path forward there? Peter Griffith : Colin, thank you. Look, on the case, we're very confident in the position we've had and our structure and how we've allocated profits between Puerto Rico and the United States. So we're very confident in those reserves. If you did think about going forward, I did suggest in the press release articulated that the IRS is currently auditing 2016 through '18. If they did propose any transfer pricing adjustment, which is in the audit, the magnitude of those adjustments will be lessened by the change in tax rate from the 2017 Tax Act, which reduced the differences between the tax rates applicable in the United States and Puerto Rico by approximately 2/3 beginning in 2018. But once again, we're very confident how we're structured and we're very confident in the level of our reserves. And so we don't anticipate any changes going forward. Bob Bradway : And Dave, do you want to get to the second piece of that? David Reese : Yes, with regards to the ELCC data, these were uncontrolled data from an investigator in France, patients receiving monotherapy potentially after checkpoint inhibitors. I can tell you that the rates of hepatic toxicity were higher than we have observed in our clinical trials program and through our ongoing pharmacovigilance effort. So I'm not sure why that was the case, but it was a heterogeneous unselected group of patients. It's hard for us to comment any further on those data. Bob Bradway : Let me just thank all of you for dialing in. We appreciate your support and your interest in the Company. As we've tried to convey through this call, we feel we're executing well here into the 2022 calendar year. And we look forward to being back together with you after the second quarter to report on our progress through the midyear. Thank you. Sorry, we went a few minutes over. Thanks. Arvind Sood : Thank you everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call, and we thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : My name is Jason and I'll be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Second Quarter of 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Okay, Jason, thank you. Good afternoon, everybody and welcome to our Q2 call. Lots to cover today so we'll go and jump right in. Some of the key themes you'll hear about today include continued volume driven growth, our strategy of seeking both internal and external innovation, the latter exemplified by our announcement this morning of acquiring ChemoCentryx and lastly navigating through a difficult macro environment. We have posted the slides for your background, we will use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation today, and some of the statements will be forward-looking. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, we'll be discussing our second quarter performance, as well as our planned acquisition of ChemoCentryx which all of us here are very excited about. Starting with our operating results, we delivered strong volume driven growth in the second quarter, with unit volumes increasing 10%. Our innovative products performed well globally. Repatha, Otezla, Prolia and EVENITY, all delivered double-digit sales growth in the quarter. Our KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO in our innovative hematology oncology portfolio, all generated record quarterly sales. Our two newest products LUMAKRAS and TEZSPIRE are both off to a strong start. LUMAKRAS is now being prescribed for patients with non-small cell lung cancer in 25 countries around the world. TEZSPIRE has made a big impact in a short period of time for a broad population of patients with severe asthma in the U.S. With our planned acquisition of ChemoCentryx, we will be adding another newly launched innovative product to our portfolio, TAVNEOS, which is for ANCA-associated vasculitis which is a serious and sometimes life threatening autoimmune disease. TAVNEOS is a terrific medicine, the first innovation in this space in more than 10 years and very much needed given the harsh side effects of the older treatments and the seriousness of the disease. This product also fits right in Amgen's strategic sweet spot. Our decades of leadership in immunology and nephrology will enable us to add value to the TAVNEOS launch, reaching many more patients and much more quickly than would otherwise have been possible. You'll hear from Murdo in a moment, but let me just say that opportunities like this don't come along that often. We're really looking forward to working with the highly skilled and committed team from ChemoCentryx to realize the full potential of this very innovative product. We think we can make a difference for patients and own an attractive return for our shareholders from this investment. Dave will talk about the pipeline shortly and our innovative and biosimilar molecules are proceeding well through the pipeline and the highlights of course include the really encouraging data for our cardiovascular molecule Olpasiran which we expect to move into Phase 3 testing. On the oncology side, data from our BiTEs or bi-specifics in several solid tumors are giving us growing confidence in the role these molecules can play in diseases where there are still really big unmet medical needs like small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer. Across the board our biosimilars are advancing to plan setting us up for the growth of that business from future launches. Let me now turn to the current drug pricing debate in Washington. By now it won't surprise you to hear that we're disappointed by the proposed legislation. For some time, we've been advocating for reforms that respect innovation and provide improved access to it. The proposed bill does neither. The bill will impose price controls and price controls will stymie innovation. At a time when our nation needs more innovation, the result of this bill will be less of it adding to the problem to bill those precious little to improve the affordability of medicines for patients. So, when it comes to innovation and affordability, this bill is a little lose for patients. Recent developments are no surprise however, we've been positioning our business for some time for a world of compressed lifecycles and prices and if adopted this legislation will accelerate those trends and we will adapt accordingly. We continue to believe that the world needs more innovation, not less and our focus will remain on advancing more of it. Across inflammation, oncology and general medicine, we have a broad portfolio of innovative and biosimilar products meeting the needs of patients globally and we remain encouraged by the prospects for our long-term growth. Through the first half of the year, our team performed well meeting the needs of the patients we serve. I'm grateful to them for their dedication to our mission. And let me turn now over to Peter. Peter Griffith : Thank you, Bob. The CFO organization welcomes ChemoCentryx to Amgen and we're excited to help enable the teams to serve patients. We are pleased with our performance this quarter and we're on track to deliver against our long-term objectives. We continue to see the company successfully navigate through foreign exchange headwinds, increasing interest rates, inflation, supply chain pressures and the war in Europe all while working through COVID variants surges. We're grateful for the hard work of our 24,000 mission-driven colleagues at Amgen and serving our millions of patients around the globe. I will present our second quarter financial results before discussing our 2022 guidance. The financial results are shown on Slide 6 of the slide deck. We effectively executed in the second quarter with year-over-year volume driven revenue growth of one percent and product sales growth of three percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange, revenue growth and product sales growth for three percent and five percent respectively. Our EPS growth of a 163% versus our recast Q2, 2021. It's favorably impacted by the $1.5 billion Five Prime In-process R&D expense in 2021, excluding the $1.5 billion charge for Five Prime, Non-GAAP EPS grew six percent. Turning to product sales. Strong volume growth of 10% was driven by Repatha, Prolia, LUMAKRAS and EVENITY, as well as a number of other products in the portfolio. Year-over-year volume growth was partially offset by declines in net selling price of six percent and foreign exchange headwinds of two percent. Our established product portfolio generated almost one billion dollars of product sales and continues to deliver strong cash flows to fund internal and external innovation, just like the ChemoCentryx deal today. Transitioning to our biosimilars, AMGEVITA remains the most prescribed adalimumab biosimilar in Europe and we are preparing and excited for the U.S. launch of this product in January 2023. Other revenues of about $300 million decreased 24% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower COVID-19 antibody collaboration revenues versus Q2, 2021. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased year-over-year, driven primarily by the $1.5 billion Five Prime related expense in 2021 that I previously mentioned. Recall from our Q1 discussion that we've updated our non-GAAP policy to no longer exclude such expenses from our non-GAAP results in accordance with guidance issued by the SEC this year. For comparison purposes, our 2021 non-GAAP operating expenses will now include two items that were previously excluded. First, the $1.5 billion recorded in Acquired In-Process R&D associated with Five Prime in Q2, 2021, and next secondly, And next, secondly $400 million recorded in R&D related to an upfront payment to license rights to AMG 451 from Kyowa Kirin Corporation in Q3, 2021. Excluding the impact of the Five Prime in-process R&D, $1.5 billion charge in Q2, '21, second quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses declined five percent year-over-year, reflecting continuous improvement driven by digitalization, process simplification and automation, which more than offset investments to advance our pipeline and support product launches on a non-GAAP basis cost of sales as a percent of product sales decreased 2.2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 14.7%, primarily due to lower COVID-19 antibody shipments and direct manufacturing costs, partially offset by evolving product mix. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the second quarter decreased two percent year-over-year, primarily due to lower marketed product support, partially offset by higher spend in research and early pipeline. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the second quarter declined two percent year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments and activities while driving productivity. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were a net $410 million expense in Q2. This was driven by net interest expense and our share of BeiGene results as a result of our use of the equity method of accounting. We have a strong balance sheet, generates significant cash flow and retain significant financial flexibility to execute strategic business development opportunities. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, today's announcement of the acquisition of ChemoCentryx is a great example of investing in the best innovation, whether internal or external. Second, investing in our business through capital expenditures including for our new environmentally friendly facilities under construction in Ohio and North Carolina. Third, returning capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including a $1.94 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from last year's quarter. And fourth, opportunistic share repurchases and while we had no share buybacks in the second quarter, Q1, 2022 at $6.3 billion. Let's turn to the outlook for the business for 2022. We are pleased with our progress through the first half of 2022 and we continue to be confident in the trajectories of our growth brands. For the full year, we now expect to absorb $500 million in foreign exchange headwinds against product sales based on recent foreign exchange rates, of which we absorb $200 million in the first half of the year, reflecting our effective execution today while considering the challenging foreign exchange dynamics, we are narrowing our 2022 revenue guidance range to $25.5 billion to $26.4 billion. Our non-GAAP EPS range of $17 to $18 remains unchanged. This range encompasses foreign exchange headwinds of approximately three percent or $0.45 for the full year based on recent foreign exchange rates. Of that $0.45 we experienced approximately $0.20 in the first half of the year. So we anticipate an additional $0.25 in foreign exchange headwinds against EPS in the second half of the year. Our non-GAAP EPS range also encompasses cost associated with our acquisition of ChemoCentryx, both foreign exchange and ChemoCentryx will influence our performance within the range. I'll share a few additional points to consider for the remainder of 2022 with a particular focus on how these trends are likely to impact Q3 and Q4. First, we expect foreign exchange headwinds against product sales in Q3 and Q4 of approximately a $50 million in each quarter for a total of $300 million for the second half of the year. These headwinds are most pronounced in brands with significant ex-U.S. scale such as Prolia, Aranesp, AMGEVITA, Vectibix and XGEVA. Second, anticipated negative pricing trends for MVASI and KANJINTI are expected to continue in the second half of the year and we expect quarter over quarter product sales declines in those products for the remainder of the year. We expect KANJINTI sales for the year of roughly $300 million and MVASI sales for the year of roughly $850 million. As we've noted, growth in Biosimilars will be driven by the addition of new products and geographies and we look forward to being the first Biosimilar, the HUMIRA to launch in the United States with Amgevita in January, 2023. Third, we expect Q3 Enbrel product sales to approximate Q2 Enbrel product sales. Fourth, for the full year, we now expect Neulasta product sales to be between $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion. This is a change from our previous range of $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion. We expect a negative pricing trends for Neulasta will continue in the second half of the year. Fifth, although we expect that net impact of these factors will result in Q3 revenues and EPS lower than Q2. I would reiterate that our full year EPS guidance remains unchanged at $17 to $18. We now expect other revenue for 2022 to be in the range of $1.4 to $1.6 billion versus our prior range of $1.4 to $1.7 billion. Our expectations for total non-GAAP operating expenses for 2022 are unchanged from the last time we spoke. We continue to expect that operating expenses will increase in the second half of the year versus the first half of this year, including important investments in our pipeline as well as both current and upcoming launches. Again including Amgevita in January, '23 and increasing R&D spend in the third and the fourth quarter. We continue to expect 2022 non-GAAP operating margin as a percent of product sales to be roughly 50%. We continue to expect non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 15.5% to 16.5%. Our expectations for non-GAAP R&D in 2022 remain unchanged. Based on our recast 2021 results which now include $400 million of expense in Q3, related to the license with KKC for AMG 451. Our expected 2022 non-GAAP R&D expense now equates to a decrease of 46% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to be flat to slightly down year-over-year as a percent of product sales. We continue to expect other income and expenses to be in the range of $1.6 to $1.8 billion with an increase in Q3 over the run rate of the first two quarters due to both increasing interest rates, and our share of BeiGene's results. And finally, for the full year, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate range of 14.0% to 15.0%, up from our prior guidance of 13.5% to 14.5%. We will effectively execute throughout the remainder of 2022, despite the continuing headwinds we will continue investing in the best innovation. We look forward to the launch of Amgevita in January, '23 driving the launch of the Tezspire and Lumakras progressing our pipeline, successfully integrating ChemoCentryx and delivering on our 2030 objectives. This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Murdo. Murdo? Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Peter. Second quarter product sales increased three percent year-over-year driven by a 10% volume increase. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, global product sales grew five percent, we delivered record quarterly sales for Prolia, EVENITY, AMGEVITA, KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO and delivered double-digit volume growth for several additional products including Repatha and LUMAKRAS. Our ex-U.S. business grew five percent, with volume growth of 20% year-over-year. In addition to the strong second quarter, I'm also personally excited about our announcement to acquire ChemoCentryx and the opportunity to help patients with severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis, a serious and potentially life-threatening autoimmune disease. I'll say more about TAVNEOS as I comment on the performance of our inflammation portfolio. I'll start with our General Medicine business, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and Aimovig. Overall revenue for this portfolio grew 17% year-over-year driven by 24% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 13% year-over-year. Volumes grew 12%, driven by an increase in both new and repeat patients. EVENITY had record sales of a $191 million for the quarter, driven by 60% volume growth in the U.S. and 37% volume growth outside of the U.S. Enbrel sales decreased eight percent year-over-year for the second quarter, primarily driven by declines in net selling price and volume. Enbrel remains a frequently prescribed therapy due to its long track record of efficacy and safety. Our launch of Tezspire is off to a very strong start with $29 million in sales in the second quarter. I'm encouraged to see that both allergists and pulmonologists have prescribed Tezspire across a broad range of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We're also seeing initiation in both biologic naive and previously treated patients. On the access front, Tezspire is a medical benefit product for which we received permanent reimbursement coding as of July 1. Physicians acknowledge Tezspire's unique differentiated profile and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe asthma who are uncontrolled or biologic eligible without any final phenotypic and biomarker limitation. Now, our agreement to acquire ChemoCentryx brings a compelling opportunity into our leading inflammation and nephrology portfolio with TAVNEOS, a recently launched first-in-class treatment for ANCA-associated by Vasculitis or AAV. Let me take a minute to talk about how important I think TAVNEOS will be for patients. AAV is a serious systemic autoimmune disease that leads to inflammation and eventual destruction of small blood vessels. This inflammatory process can lead to permanent organ damage and in some severe cases can be life threatening. TAVNEOS represents a significant advance in the treatment options for the eight to 10,000 U.S. patients a year who develop severe active disease or experience major relapses of AAV. We are looking forward to meeting and working with the talented team at ChemoCentryx and I'm confident that by applying Amgen's deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence, we can help many more patients with AAV with TAVNEOS. Moving to our hematology and oncology business. Our six innovative products grew 14% year-over-year with 11% volume growth. This was driven by strong volume growth for KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO which we expect to continue throughout this year. XGEVA volume declined two percent in Q1 and was flat year-over-year in Q2. Our launch of LUMAKRAS is progressing well with revenues of $77 million in the second quarter, representing 24% quarter-over-quarter growth. In the U.S., LUMAKRAS has been prescribed to over 3,000 patients by over 1900 physicians, and we've seen broad adoption in the community setting where the majority of non-small cell lung cancer patients are treated. Unfortunately, while 85% of patients in the U.S. are tested for their KRAS G12C status, only 50% of the time do oncologists have these test results available to support second-line treatment decisions and our teams are removing barriers to ensure that the oncologist is able to review KRAS G12C status when the patient progresses beyond first-line therapy and we've seen that when the KRAS G12C status is known in the second line setting, 85% of patients receive LUMAKRAS. Outside the U.S., LUMAKRAS has now been approved in over 40 countries and we're actively launching in 25 markets and rapidly pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries. Sales of our oncology Biosimilars declined 24% year-over-year, while our biosimilars for inviting KANJINTI both hold leading shares. We expect continued net selling price deterioration and volume declines driven by increased competition. In total, our Biosimilars portfolio has become an industry-leading franchise, which has contributed $5.5 billion of product sales cumulatively. Looking forward, we're excited about the upcoming launch of AMGEVITA in the United States in January of 2023, followed by the next wave of Biosimilar launches to STELARA, EYLEA and SOLIRIS. Overall, I'm very pleased with our execution and volume growth in the quarter. Our expanding international presence and diverse portfolio of products, including the exciting addition of TAVNEOS position us well to deliver on our long-term growth strategy. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave. David Reese : Thanks Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by sharing my excitement for the transaction we announced today. As you've heard ANCA-associated vasculitis is a serious and sometimes life threatening disorder. Having treated these patients personally, I fully appreciate the challenges they face and the benefits of TAVNEOS in addressing the significant unmet need. I look forward to working with the team at ChemoCentryx. For research and development, the second quarter was one of continued execution where we announced new data on several programs and continued to progress, our robust innovative clinical pipeline. Beginning with inflammation, in July TEZSPIRE was recommended for approval in the European Union by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for severe asthma and also approved in Canada. We initiated the SUNRISE Phase 3 study, designed to assess the efficacy and safety of TEZSPIRE in reducing oral corticosteroid use in adults with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma. The ROCKET Phase 3 program evaluating rocatinlimab, an innovative anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis was initiated in June. Following additional discussions with regulators and our partner, we are amending the studies to further improve patient convenience and investigate a range of doses. No safety or efficacy issues have arisen. We continue to remain very excited about the broad potential of this program in atopic dermatitis. In oncology, we will present data from two of our thoracic programs at the upcoming World Conference on Lung Cancer. The first is tarlatamab, the DLL3 targeting HLE BiTE molecule being studied in heavily pretreated patients with small cell lung cancer, a population with few treatment options. In this setting tarlatamab demonstrated promising antitumor activity with notable response durability. We look forward to presenting an updated data set in the World Conference and continue to enroll patients in a potentially registrational Phase 2 trial in this setting. We're also investigating tarlatamab in combination with standard of care in first-line small cell lung cancer in combination with AMG 404, a PD-1 inhibitor in patients with second line or later small cell lung cancer and in neuroendocrine prostate cancer. I'll also present data from our LUMAKRAS checkpoint inhibitor in SHIP2 combination studies. Data from the former are embargoed until August 7. So we can't discuss the results today, but we can say is the PD-1 have been challenging to combined with other targeted agents due to tolerability issues. We will present a comprehensive dataset from this study. As a reminder, we are investigating multiple potential pass to first line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with LUMAKRAS potentially segmented by PD-L1 expression levels where the non-small cell lung cancer population breaks down into roughly thirds across PD-L1 high expressers, low expressers and PD-L1 negative expression. We've seen promising early data in the PD-L1 negative population and based on discussions with regulators, we are planning to initiate a Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS plus chemotherapy in first-line advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. While a smaller dataset, we are very encouraged by both the efficacy and safety of the LUMAKRAS combination with Revolution Medicines SHIP2 inhibitor RMC 4630. In patients without prior KRAS G12C inhibitor treatment, three of four patients with non-small cell lung cancer who received the highest two doses of RMC 4630 in combination with LUMAKRAS at a confirmed partial response and all four had disease control. In gastrointestinal cancer, we are also pleased to announce that data from the full dose expansion Phase 1b study of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in refractory KRAS G12C mutated colorectal cancer were accepted for presentation at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress taking place in September. The final analysis of the FIGHT study Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, controlled trial evaluating Bemarituzumab, a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b FGFR2b targeting monoclonal antibody and modified FOLFOX6 in patients with previously untreated advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer was completed. These results continue to demonstrate the Bemarituzumab plus modified FOLFOX6 improves the clinical outcome of patients with FGFR2b expressing tumors with no new safety concerns. A greater survival benefit was observed with increasing levels of FGFR2b expression. In general Medicine, we announced top line data from a Phase 2 study of Olpasiran, our small interfering RNA targeting Lp(a). These data demonstrated a significant reduction from baseline in Lp(a) of up to or greater than 90% at week 36, the primary endpoint and week 48 at the end of treatment period for the majority of doses, which range from once every 12 weeks to once every 24 weeks in dosing frequency. No new safety concerns were identified during this treatment period. Presentation of these results is expected at a medical congress in the second half of this year. We're very excited about this innovative molecule and are moving to rapidly initiate a Phase 3 outcome study. AMG 133, a multispecific that inhibits the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR) and activates the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor, has completed enrollment. We are planning to submit data from the initial cohorts of this Phase 1 study to a medical congress occurring late this year and are actively the Phase 2 program for this molecule. In conclusion, with an innovative portfolio, we're approximately three quarters of our clinical stage programs have first-in-class potential and a growing portfolio of Biosimilars, we are well positioned to continue to deliver important new medicines for patients and growth for shareholders over the near and long term. And with that, I'll turn it back to Bob for questions and answers. Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Dave. Jason, could you remind our callers of the process for asking a question? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Jay Olson : Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the ChemoCentryx deal, it looks like a really exciting opportunity to treat patients with high unmet medical need in AAV. Can you just talk about the synergies, in particular our revenue synergy potential, and then the strategic fit for ChemoCentryx within your organization? Thank you. Bob Bradway : Yes. Thanks, Jay. We, as you can tell we're excited about the fit. We expect our teams and implant inflammation and nephrology will be excited to have this product added inside Amgen and in terms of synergies, obviously, it's a very good fit, but we're focused on investing and growing this opportunity, we think we see some opportunities to help the team at ChemoCentryx reach even more patients and they have so far. So our focus will be on that and so I don't think we really have much more to say at this point other than reiterating that we're excited about because it addresses an important need in the marketplace, it makes a big difference for patients who otherwise don't have great alternatives available to them. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Chris Raymond : Thanks very much, maybe just on also another question maybe digging in the TAVNEOS and also if I can touch on Bob, your comments on the drug pricing legislation as it relates to this deal. So I think you guys point out having a nephrology and inflam presence is kind of unique for you guys in the commercial side, maybe just give a bit more color how you intend to leverage these two forces in the specific role. So have and then maybe the second part of this drug pricing language there is a decent amount of angst specifically around provisions targeting small molecules and allowing CMS to negotiate and you're nine so ChemoCentryx is predominantly a small molecule company, just maybe square those two issues there, if you will. Thanks. Bob Bradway : Murdo wanted to start on the first question. Murdo Gordon : Thanks for the question Chris. We are obviously pleased with the very nice strategic fit of TAVNEOS in our portfolio. The ChemoCentryx's team have been mostly focused on rheumatology and there are sub-specialties of rheumatologists who treat a lot of these AAV patients. So, they've been quite focused in their commercial efforts so far, we can scale that much more broadly, we have a national footprint on rheumatology given our current in-line inflammation business and we can also add nephrology, about a third of these patients end up getting diagnosed by nephrologist given that one of the presentations AAV is renal impairment or a renal inflammation, I should say. So that's the immediate benefit, but we've also got resources like our patient support programing, our medical teams, our institutional key account managers and our ability to work with payers to ensure that medical policies in prior authorizations are seamless for providers and patients. So, there is a lot we can bring to the table beyond just a very focused, but very effective so far ChemoCentryx effort. Bob Bradway : And with respect to Washington, Chris, obviously we evaluated this in the context of the legislation, the potential legislation that's making its way through the Senate at the moment and well, as you point out, this is a small molecule product, we don't expect that there's any particular risk for this product as compared to other small molecules that could become subject to the price controls implied or pluses in the legislation so again, we think this is an attractive product, the clinical profile looks really well suited to the needs of the marketplace and we're excited to be joining the team with them. Operator : Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Salveen Richter : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow-up here. I'd like to dig a little deeper into what you said in the prepared remarks about the passage of this legislation, accelerating trend to reposition the business and manage lifecycles. Do you think this increases the urgency for M&A, given your financial strength and if so, what types of targets probably would make sense given the debate about non-orphan products versus orphan products and just a second question here on AMGEVITA being first to market, maybe you can just give us a sense of how that positions you and an early payer discussions here. Thank you. Bob Bradway : Yes, you will catch the second piece of that Murdo and I'll address the first which is with respect to Washington again Salveen. As you know, this is still potential legislation. So we'll watch carefully to see if it gets passed and it if goes exactly what gets passed. So, I don't think at this point, will say anything more specific than what I said in my opening remarks, which is that we've been advocating for reform that would promote innovation and improve patient access to it and we'll be concerned to the extent of the legislation passes doesn't do those two things. Murdo Gordon : And Salveen on AMGEVITA, obviously we're pleased that we're first out of the gate with the AMGEVITA launch in the U.S. at the end of January next year, we were pleased with our performance outside the U.S. with AMGEVITA where we've established market leadership at the higher share and we've been able to hold that despite competition. Obviously, the U.S. market is a different market given payer in reimbursement structure, but we feel confident that we'll be able to establish good access and coverage for AMGEVITA early in the launch lifecycle and we think that PBMs and payers are interested in ensuring their patients and members have biosimilar availability and option. So, all going well and according to plan. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Umer Raffat : Hi guys, I'll ask two today, if I may, one on your deal and one on the quarter. Maybe starting with the quarterly update, I saw your partner as well as your press release talked about the lack of safety issue on the OX40 program. However, the need to perhaps change the dosing regimen. I guess my question is, if there is no safety issues that, is it fair to assume there is a biomarker change maybe a severe TH drop in a subset of patients, which could be prompting this regulatory feedback. And if you could remind us what dose were you currently using every two weeks in Phase 3. And then on ChemoCentryx deal. I think it's an interesting case study on sort of where the clinical data stood versus how good the commercial receptivity has been, but is it fair to assume that you wouldn't have moved forward with the deal, unless they were already yet perhaps 700 plus patients by now and their peak patient guidance was 6,000. Thank you very much. Bob Bradway : Okay. Dave, do you want to take the first. David Reese : Yes, thanks Umer. In regards to OX40, yes, no safety issue, no biomarker issue either, no change in any kind of patient subset. As I said in my prepared remarks beginning this is really driven by ongoing discussions with the FDA to explore broader range of doses and we took that opportunity to we think improve patient convenience. I wouldn't overthink it or read anything more into it than that and we don't think that this will affect overall program timelines. Bob Bradway : I'm not exactly sure what you're looking for in your specific question, but Murdo feel free to jump in. Murdo Gordon : Yes, Umer, we've been following the TAVNEOS journey for a while and I think what everybody has to remember here is that the nature of this disease. I mean this is a severe acute autoimmune inflammation that involves the lungs, the kidneys, sometimes skin and other organs and can cause permanent end organ damage if not treated effectively and efficiently and quickly and the current standards of care are difficult treatments for patients to tolerate and if you can intervene and improve that patients potential to remain relapse-free over the first 52 weeks as a rheumatologist or a nephrologist, if you all you have to do is add TAVNEOS to their base regimen, you're going to do that. So I think the behavioral change here is one that many physicians are choosing to do and that as you alluded to, that's been encouraging to see in the early phase of this launch. But the reason we like TAVNEOS is it helps reduce the potential relapse for patients by adding TAVNEOS to the current standard of care and potentially reducing glucocorticoid use. So this is a disease area that if we were doing the development on our own it would fit squarely in our strategy and so it comes in, into a strong inflammation portfolio and it's one that we think our scale and commercial and medical capabilities will allow us to accelerate what has already been a good launch. Bob Bradway : I'd say Umer that we are obviously attractive the fact and is still at an early stage of its launch. We think we can add value to that and the feedback from the marketplace has been encouraging. The prescriber and patient based marketplace, that is. Okay, let's move on. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Michael Yee : Thanks for the question, now maybe for David. I know the upcoming data you've talked about the challenge in combination with PD-1. So maybe you could just right size your expectations is the bar fairly high there to move forward due to talks. And is your focus on front line really into the combination with chemo. So maybe just make a comment there and if you could just sneak in a second, when you actually talk about AMG 133 on your slide deck, I know there's a lot of focus obviously in obesity. Can you just comment on what we're supposed to know there advancing that forward. Thank you. David Reese : Yes, sure. So in terms of Lumakras PD-1 combination, obviously I can't say much because of the embargo we're presenting these data Sunday afternoon in Vienna. As we think about development in first-line I'd like to think of kind of three buckets of patients are those whose tumors are PD-L1 negative, those who are PD-L1 low to intermediate and those that are PD-L1 high expressers. As I mentioned and as you picked up on in the PD-L1 negative population, we're moving forward with a Lumakras plus chemotherapy Phase 3 trial and then we will disclose the results of the checkpoint inhibitor data in Vienna and outline our plans for further development in this space, I think that's probably all I can say right now, but I would really think about this as different groups of patients where the therapy will be tailored to their particular tumor based on PD-L1 expression. On AMG 133, very pleased with our progress there as I mentioned, we completed enrollment in the Phase 1. We hope to present that we are submitting, in the process of submitting that to a medical congress and we're very actively planning what the Phase 2 program will look like and we'll have more to say about that as our plans are finalized over in the coming months. Michael Yee : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Bob, If I could just ask your sort of outlook on BD and M&A. We see due to modestly sized deals for assets with a bit of a pipeline over the course of the last year. How do you think about continuing to do more deals of that size versus something larger and more transformational and just how do you think about where you are in terms of adding assets versus where you'd like to be? Bob Bradway : Matt, I don't think anything has changed, we continue to look for ways to invest in the business and our focus is on trying to find the best innovation and to try to advance particularly in the areas where we've been clear about our stated interest. So implant oncology and then the general medicine area. So we continue to look, there are obviously many more opportunities in the small and medium size and there are in the large size. But as I've said consistently through my tenure Matt, we feel responsibility to look at all the options to add value for our shareholders and we'll continue to do that. Arvind Sood : Jason, next question? Operator : Our next question comes from David Risinger with SVB Securities. Your line is now open. David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. So my question is related to understanding interchangeable Biosimilars and there are two parts, please. So first, obviously AMGEVITA is in a great position in the first half of next year, but could you talk about that product's ability to compete with interchangeable Biosimilars that are launching in the second half of '23 since AMGEVITA won't have that designation. And then the other part is news just hit a couple of days ago that the FDA approved Biosimilar Lucentis as interchangeable even though there was never a switching study conducted. So, I'm wondering if that's a sign that your ABP 938 or Biosimilar EYLEA is likely to also be approved as an interchangeable. Thank you. Arvind Sood : Thanks, David for the question. I would say right now in our conversations with payers and insurers and for that matter, physicians interchangeability has not been a barrier to have them consider AMGEVITA as an option and an alternative to the innovator. We are pursuing interchangeability with AMGEVITA and we'll expect those data to readout later on in the launch. So I think our incumbent position being first to launch will help whether additional competition as they enter if they have interchangeability and our expectation is at least a couple will but we'll follow quickly with our own interchangeability data. So, it will be a short period in time where that competitive advantage may exist or persist in the market. As for ABP 938, I won't speculate on what the FDA might say about that. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Mohit Bansal : Great, thanks for taking my question and maybe a question on LUMAKRAS Phase 3 study. So, Dave, what do you think could be clinically meaningful benefit forward docetaxel in this particular study. And the other part of the question is basically if you think about a chemo post-IO chemo tends to do well. Do you think placebo response could be better than historical in this particular trial? Thank you. David Reese : In terms of the Phase 3 study on track to report out this quarter, it's an event driven trial, if we see behavior of LUMAKRAS consistent with what we've observed really across the program to date in advanced lung cancer, I think we will be well positioned there. The trial has 90% power to detect a significant difference in progression-free survival. So, it's very well powered, I'm sure it will be a well conducted study and so we look forward to having those data soon. In terms of the placebo response, that I think it's hard to speculate on that. The trial that we are conducting in the PD-L1 negatives as chemotherapy plus LUMAKRAS against what would be considered a standard therapy arm where the addition of checkpoint inhibitors has a relatively modest additive benefit. So, based on preliminary data that we've seen, looking at LUMAKRAS in combination with chemotherapy as what's given us the confidence to move into Phase 3 and we've had productive discussions with regulators about that trial design. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff Meacham : Thanks so much for the question. I had one on LUMAKRAS, I guess Murdo for you. Commercially, when you look at the U.S. trends over the past say three quarters or so, maybe just help us with kind of are you reaching peak sort of saturation for G12C testing? How do you think about that in terms of the timing of getting to that same level outside the U.S. and then maybe, lot of people have asked about kind of the, the Phase 3 combo studies, but maybe if there is a, at a high level kind of an incremental opportunity that you would envision as you look to the combination study data. Thank you. Murdo Gordon : Yes, thanks for the question, Geoff. I would say it's less about peak testing in the U.S. where we've already got about 85% of frontline patients being tested and receiving a KRAS G12C status. Right now what we know is only half of the tested patient population in second line has the test result available when they're progressing. So that's really what we're focused on, we are focused on where is that test result for that progressing patients so that that treating oncologist can give the patient the benefit of LUMAKRAS and when they have that test is again half the time, 85% of those patients get LUMAKRAS. So we're getting a very high percentage penetration of those second line patients when the prescribing physician knows their test results. So, we are not picking yet. We've got headroom for more improvement there, currently about half of those patients are not getting their KRAS G12C test result reviewed upon progression. So that's an important thing that it seems are focused on. That's what we think we can do to continue to drive some revenue growth in the U.S. and outside the U.S., what we're seeing is really again a tale of two types of markets in markets like Germany, Switzerland and France where biomarker testing is very well developed and their clinical information systems are also very well developed, so that test is available and retrievable upon progression in second line. We're seeing very rapid lift and uptake in places where that's not quite as well developed I think Spain, Italy, to some extent, the U.K., the uptake resembles more what we've seen in the U.S., Geoff Meacham : And just clarify. This is in our expanded access programs? Murdo Gordon : In our expanded access programs where we've seen clinical utilization, but I'm also talking about other experience with other targeted therapies, you're going to see a slower uptake in some markets than you will in others because of that testing infrastructure. So, we're working on that with those markets, we're changing that behavior with clinicians. And I think we'll be able to successfully grow this product in second line and of course, if we get confirmatory data in Phase 3, what that does is it makes it easier to promote because we're no longer on an accelerated approval and hopefully the datacenter compelling and continue to reinforce the value of LUMAKRAS. Bob Bradway : Jason, next question? Operator : The next question comes from Yaron Werber with Cowen. Your line is now open. Yaron Werber : Great, thanks for taking my question. David, it's for you with respect to Tavneos, the drug was tested in C3 glomerulopathy and also severe HS hidradenitis suppurativa and that data was a bit mixed. I think they were looking for FDA feedback and C3G and they're are thinking about Lupus Nephritis as well potentially starting another study and you thoughts is that these indications that you were supportive of. Thank you. David Reese : Hi. thanks, Yaron. Yes. So there are other disorders as you're indicating in which Tavneos has been investigated where activation of this limb of the complement cascade may play a role in the inflammatory disease process such as C3 glomerulopathy and hidradenitis suppurativa, we'll look at all of those data. Look at the programs with our new colleagues from ChemoCentryx and determine what the best path forward is to potentially address again diseases where there's currently very little effective therapy. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open. Carter Gould : Great. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. So, I wanted to come to your hemog franchise, you still have BLINCYTO and KYPROLIS but we saw the discontinuation of the latest kind of bite you had in myeloma, Amgen had a multi-year effort to try to extend its myeloma franchise. Is that still where does that rank in terms of priorities and I guess just speaking more broadly what does it say about the sort of the innovation jumps required to compete in hemog going forward. Thank you. Bob Bradway : We're going to take this in two parts. I think with respect to KYPROLIS obviously we're encouraged by the ongoing performance of that. And more generally to hemog portfolios, you referred to talk about the ongoing successful BLINCYTO again we're very encouraged by what we see and what we think we can continue to do for patients in relapsed-refractory ALL. But I think you also raised an important point, which is that multiple myeloma is a very crowded space and our decision with respect to 701 had a lot to do with our ability to get the market ahead of the competition or not. So, we're prioritizing on those medicines where we think we can be best-in-class and first-in-class and we have other programs underway that may be useful in multiple myeloma and Dave, you want to -- David Reese : Yes. As an area look we're guided by the science and the biology that we uncover AMG 701 what that was strategic multiple agents targeting BCMA and we chose to focus our efforts on for example tarlatamab DLL3 program where we've got a substantial lead. We've got a molecule that's extremely active, same platform is AMG 701 and so I think you'll see this kind of prioritization going forward. Arvind Sood : Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO. Your line is now open. Evan Seigerman : Thank you so much for taking my question and congrats on the deal earlier today, I actually want to touch on your prostate cancer efforts. Can you just walk me through some of the details around do you prioritizing 160 for the lower affinity T cell BiTE and just given the recent data we've seen in this space that may be newer technologies bispecific targeting CD 28 PSMA, how do you think your efforts can remain competitive here? Thank you. Bob Bradway : Thanks for the question. So it's, we've got now a pair of molecules targeting prostate cancer, actually three if you include neuroendocrine prostate cancer where we're conducting a Tarlatamab study where DLL3 expression is quite frequent in neuroendocrine tumors. But first AMG 509 targeting steep one I continue to be impressed with the data we are generating in that trial and we are moving ahead with all deliberate speed to advance that program. We hope to be able to share data either late this year or sometime into next year from that dose escalation in first in human study and then, as I had indicated, all along we would take a look at the accumulating data from AMG 160 Acapatamab and AMG 340 which came to us through the Teneobio acquisition and based on what we saw, we elected to prioritize AMG 340 targeting PSMA going forward. The data you're alluding to, from a few days ago is a handful of patients some we've seen in the similar things in early phases. I think what you need is more patients and in particular prolonged follow up, especially in this disease and in that regards on the quite encouraged with what I'm seeing from AMG 509 for example. So that portfolio of three medicines is advancing I feel actually on very optimistic about what we may be able to do in prostate cancer. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Michael Schmidt : Thanks for taking my questions. I had one on Aimovig. Just wondering if you could run market dynamics here just given 11% volume decline, is that a function of competitive dynamics or doesn't have to do with pricing and how should we think about peak potential given those trends? Thank you. Arvind Sood : Thanks for the question, Michael. I think our focus on Aimovig has been one where we're making sure that we address the patient population patient population in a way in which we provide good access, but at a reasonable in that price and I think strategically, we've been able to do that well, we did lose one major PBM to be at the end of last year into this year and that's affected volume evolution. But we've also been able to improve our net pricing year-on-year. So from a profitability standpoint Aimovig is doing better. I think longer term, it's early in the marketplace CGRP class should be growing faster than it is given that the antibodies are much, much better than what's available in the market and the older non CGRP class and of course we've got the advent of the orals, so it's early days. We're still watching it play out, we continue to focus on promoting for the preventive patients that have high frequency migraine and we continue to do well there. So longer term, I think there's just a lot to wait and see. Arvind Sood : Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Robyn Karnauskas : Great. I think you. I Just had one question and a follow-up question on the platform. So for OTEZLA, just talk a little bit about, given the lower price topicals and some of the data, new drugs that are going to approved in September, your thoughts on pricing and how we should think about that over the next year or two because I know you need more volume on those new drugs, but they could put some pricing pressure. And then on the BiTE platform in general, just to follow-up to Evan's question, I mean, so at what point do you -- seeing the new BiTE spec data coming out across the board from other companies at the -- from Regeneron as well, like at what point you deprioritize BiTE versus, say, the new bispec that are out there and put the money toward other things? Thanks. Arvind Sood : So thanks for the question, Robyn. I'll start with the Otezla question on how with the topical entry into the market is affecting our business. I think overall we've been really pleased with the expansion of our own label to include the mild patient population and what I am encouraged by is in our conversations with payers and PBMs, we were able to have that that label expansion include those patients in our current contracted coverage without adding any value to our deals with the payers, so we didn't have to increase our rebate rate to have the myeloma patient population included in fact, what we've seen is more and more PBMs and plans are removing prior authorization requests for Otezla. So, overall, I'd say our access is improving quite a bit without a deterioration in the race having to pay for it, where I think you'll see continued net price pressure is in our co-pay assistance that we provide to patients in affordability. That's really what we see as a dynamic on the net price of Otezla in the U.S. What we're not seeing though is pressure on the net price because of the topical entrants. The challenge with the topical entrants is they don't have broad payer coverage yet and so until that happens, I think Otezla will continue to do well on the, on the access coverage end rate that we pay for it. Longer term, I think, it remains to be seen whether these are in direct competition or complementary to the patient types that we treat if you talk to their dermatologists, patients fall into categories where they don't want to move into a systemic treatment and stay on topicals and those that are willing to try a topical because the body surface area involvement, the location of their psoriasis, many factors come into play, and that's really where we are competing is people who have already decided they want a systemic agent. So I think they're are non-overlapping populations for the most part, and we don't necessarily see with topicals is applying pricing pressure. David Reese : Thanks, Robyn. In regards to the BiTE platform, we've been working for some time on new generation technologies that will incorporate things like logic gates with multiple targets where either an AND gate or an or gate is engineered into the pipe for activation, the real goal here is to do two things, one, try and enhance efficacy, and two increase the therapeutic window so that you have is a little normal tissue-targeting as possible from the agents. So first molecules are moving towards the clinic, and we'll have more to say about that as we get ready to launch. Bob Bradway : Okay. Jason, I know, we're a little bit past the top of the hour, but we've got a couple more questions in the queue. So why don't we take a couple more and then if we don't get to you Arvind and his team will be around receiving for some time. Could I just go for the next call? Operator : Our next question is from Dane Leone with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Dane Leone : Thank you for taking the questions. I just wanted to get a, obviously a focus of everyone of estimating what the real opportunity for Lumakras is in the U.S. here. Could you maybe just define your understanding of patients that might be eligible for LUMAKRAS that are in the current study is the current clinical studies or other patients that might be in assistance co-pay or other schemes where they would be on drug, but just not on commercial paid for drug. I think that would be helpful is again, obviously the run rate as well below what the estimates would be and people are just trying to triangulate over time what the peak sales could really be here in the U.S. Thank you. Arvind Sood : Yes, Dane. I think I understand your question, but you don't please ask for clarification, if I don't address it that the clinical trial steal rate. If you will, patients who are not in commercial drug treatment, but are enrolled in other clinical trials is relatively small as a percentage of the total second-line non-small cell lung cancer patient. I'd say, less than 10% would be an estimate, it does vary goes up and down depending on the clinical activity of other investigational drugs and trials that are happening as I was answering a question earlier. The major challenge in growing LUMAKRAS in second line is ensuring that the prescribing physician has the KRAS G12C test result available to them when the lung cancer patient is progressing from frontline to second line. That's the gap in the treatment patient journey and right now our estimate is that that happens about 50% of the time and we are working to increase that. When that does occur, when the prescribing physician has the KRAS G12C result 8.5 times at attend that patient gets LUMAKRAS. So, we know that the profile of the product is conducive to that second-line treatment choice. We just, we just have to make sure we close down the administrative challenges of having that test result and patient in second line meet at the same time, we're also driving awareness and usage of our liquid biopsy for retesting and reassessment of that patient as they progress to second line. I hope that answers your question. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Tim Anderson : Thank you very much. Can I go back to Amgevita and Biosimilars here in the U.S., our sense is that payers may view the imperative of simply being to offer the best priced product to their constituents and I'm wondering whether with enough additional rebate maybe branded HUMIRA ends up being that lowest priced product. So my question, two questions really. Do you agree that the most important driver of what product used prioritize going to be net price or are there other factors at play and then is it in the realm of possibilities that branded HUMIRA ends up being that lowest-priced products? Thank you. Arvind Sood : Yes, thanks. It's an important driver obviously. Net price is definitely something that the pharmacy benefit managers are focused on as are the upstream insurers, but not the only one. And I think this is where we've been able to successfully differentiate our biosimilars in the past and we are confident we'll be able to do that in a go-forward basis and what I would describe it. I've described this before is that we can go to a pharmacy benefit manager and say we can make the transition from brand HUMIRA to AMGEVITA as seamless as possible. We have field force deployed that call on prescribing rheumatologists and GI physicians to treat these patients. We have patient programs that rival the innovative compound, because we are also in the marketplace with innovative compounds and we've designed these programs over many years. We have patient support to help that patient understand how to administer the product and use their device. We have world-class manufacturing of biologics and sustainability of supply and we have really good additional benefit coming with the interchangeability that I mentioned in progress. So that actually does improve confidence on the part of the PBM and the payer because they don't want to have their patients have a bad experience transitioning from brand to biosimilar. Now is it possible that the biosimilar, the brand retains a substantial share even with biosimilars in the market. Yes, of course that's possible, but we'll wait and see how that plays out. Bob, closing comments? Bob Bradway : Thank you, Arvind. And again, thank you all for joining our call. We feel that we've been executing well through the first half of the year and we're looking forward to carrying that momentum into the second half of the year and obviously excited about the ChemoCentryx announcements and what that represents the future of our inflam and nephrology franchises as well. So, thanks for joining. We'll look forward to catching up with you after the third quarter. Arvind Sood : Great, thanks, everybody. Operator : This concludes our 2022 Q2 earnings call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : My name is Jason, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Okay. Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our Q3 call. So we continued with our execution during the quarter with a focus on driving volume growth for our key products and advancing our innovative pipeline. Leading the discussion today will be our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. We have posted some slides for your reference and my customary reminder that we'll be making some forward-looking statements and use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, all of you, for joining our call. In the face of both macroeconomic and industry-specific challenges, Amgen remains laser-focused on delivering for patients and shareholders. Benefit of that focus was evident in the third quarter with volumes up a healthy 8% and 16% outside the United States. These results reflect the strong underlying demand for our medicines and the value they bring to patients even in challenging economic times like those prevailing at the moment. Revenues for the quarter were down 1%, reflecting a 5% net price decline consistent with what we communicated earlier in the year and a 2% impact from foreign exchange. All told, 11 of our products generated record sales in the quarter, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 15% with free cash flows reaching $2.8 billion for the quarter. Looking forward, we remain focused on several growth drivers. With the recent closing of the ChemoCentryx acquisition, we're excited to have TAVNEOS in our portfolio. TAVNEOS is the first new treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis in more than 10 years, and we're confident that we can leverage our decades of experience in inflammation and nephrology to bring this innovative medicine to many more patients moving forward. Two recently launched products, TEZSPIRE and LUMAKRAS, are off to solid starts. TEZSPIRE is performing well in asthma, and we have studies underway for several other indications for that product as well. LUMAKRAS is performing well globally with patients, payers and prescribers recognizing the importance of this innovation. With combination studies underway, we're exploring the many different ways this product may benefit patients through time. We have a number of key products led by Repatha, Otezla, Prolia and EVENITY that we know can benefit millions more patients globally than they do today. And let's not lose sight of the fact that these 4 products collectively generated $2 billion in third quarter sales with volume growth of 17%. We've built an industry-leading biosimilars business, having now launched five products in markets around the world, and we're months away from being the first company to launch a biosimilar to HUMIRA in the U.S. AMGEVITA is already the most prescribed HUMIRA biosimilar in Europe, giving us confidence as we prepare to enter the U.S. market. Looking forward, our next wave of biosimilars to STELARA, SOLIRIS and EYLEA are well positioned with our having now successfully completed Phase III trials for all three of these molecules. We have many potential new medicines advancing through our innovative pipeline, including Olpasiran, tarlatamab, rocatinlimab, bemarituzumab and AMG 133. These five molecules and several others that you'll hear about shortly from Dave Reese are vintage Amgen, which is first-in-class medicines that make a big difference for patients suffering from serious diseases for which there remains a real need for new and better treatments. Finally, we have a highly engaged and committed workforce, and I want to thank them, as always, for their great work. With that, let me turn over to our CFO, Peter Griffith. Peter Griffith : Thank you, Bob. We're pleased with our execution this quarter, and we are on track to deliver against our long-term objectives, most importantly serving patients. Our recently closed acquisition of ChemoCentryx adds a newly launched innovative product to our portfolio, TAVNEOS, a first-in-class and best-in-class approved treatment for patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Let's walk through our third quarter financial results before discussing our 2022 guidance. The financial results are shown on Slide 6 of the slide deck. In Q3, we recognized total revenue of $6.7 billion. This represents a modest decline of 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, total revenue and product sales grew 2% and 1%, respectively. Earnings per share of $4.70 grew 15% versus our recast Q3 2021. Recall those results included $400 million recorded in R&D expense related to our upfront payment to license rights to AMG 451, rocatinlimab, from Kyowa Kirin Corporation, KKC. Non-GAAP EPS grew 1%, excluding the $400 million expense for the KKC license. Murdo will review product sales with you, but I would highlight that our established product portfolio generated almost $900 million in product sales and continues to deliver strong cash flows to fund both internal and external innovation. Other revenues of $415 million increased 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 8% year-over-year primarily driven by the $400 million payment to KKC in Q3 2021. Excluding the impact of the $400 million upfront payment, third quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting investments to advance our research capabilities and pipeline while also supporting product launches. And we delivered a 52.5% operating margin as a percentage of product sales. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 0.3 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 16.1% primarily due to changes in product mix, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs and lower costs associated with fewer COVID-19 antibody shipments. Excluding the $400 million upfront payment, non-GAAP R&D spend in the third quarter increased 10% year-over-year primarily due to higher late-stage program support and research and early pipeline spend, partially offset by lower marketed product support. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments and activities while driving productivity, automation and digitalization. Non-GAAP OI&E was about $370 million in expense in the third quarter. This was driven by increased net interest expense and our share of BeiGene results because of our use of the equity method of accounting. Our OI&E was lower than anticipated due to gains from liability management that we do not expect to the same extent in future quarters. We have a strong balance sheet, generates significant cash flow and retain significant financial flexibility to execute strategic business development opportunities and execute on our multiple capital allocation priorities. In the third quarter, we executed on the following : first, our recent acquisition at ChemoCentryx is a clear example of investing in the best innovation, in this case, external for patients; second, investing in our business through capital expenditures, including advancing construction on our new environmentally friendly facilities in Ohio and North Carolina; third, returning capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including $1.94 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from Q3 2021; and fourth, opportunistic share repurchases. The final settlement of the accelerated share repurchase, ASR program, occurred in the third quarter, and we have repurchased about $6.3 billion of shares year-to-date. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2022. We're pleased with our execution through the third quarter. For the full year, we now expect to absorb about $560 million in FX headwinds against product sales based on recent FX rates, of which we absorbed nearly $400 million through the third quarter. And this is net of our hedging activities, reflecting our strong execution through the third quarter. And despite challenging foreign exchange dynamics, we're updating our 2022 revenue guidance range to $26.0 billion to $26.3 billion. We are updating our non-GAAP EPS range to $17.25 to $17.85. This range encompasses both FX headwinds of approximately 3% or $0.45 for the full year based on recent FX rates and costs associated with our acquisition of ChemoCentryx incurred between closing and year-end. I'll share a few additional points to consider for the remainder of 2022 with a particular focus on how these trends are likely to impact Q4. We expect FX headwinds to reduce product sales in Q4 by about $165 million. The U.S. government has agreed to purchase $290 million of Nplate. We will recognize about $200 million of those sales in Q4 with the remainder in 2023. We have completed the previously discussed divestiture of Gensenta, our generics business, in Turkey and will no longer recognize product sales and operating expenses from that business effective November 2, 2022. Sales of that business annualized at approximately $90 million. We now expect full year other revenue for 2022 between $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion versus our prior guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. When comparing against our recast 2021 results, we continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating expenses to reflect a low double-digit decrease year-over-year. We continue to expect 2022 non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50%. We continue to expect non-GAAP cost of sales in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% as a percentage of product sales. We now expect non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2022 to decrease 5% to 8% year-over-year compared to our recast 2021 non-GAAP R&D expenses, which include the $400 million upfront payment we discussed above. We expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to be roughly flat year-over-year as a percentage of product sales. We expect OI&E to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion with fourth quarter results closer to the first and second quarter results. For the full year, we now anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate range of 13.5% to 14.5%, down from our prior guidance of 14.0% to 15.0%. As you consider your modeling for 2023, recall that tax law changes enacted by Puerto Rico in June of 2022 that replaced the Puerto Rico excise tax, the PRET, in favor of an income tax will increase our 2023 income tax expense while reducing by roughly an equivalent amount of cost of goods sold. Note, however, there will be a onetime residual negative impact in 2023 related to the amount of the PRET currently capitalized in inventory that will be charged to cost of goods sold without a corresponding tax benefit. This charge is slightly larger than the benefit previously recognized with the implementation of the PRET in 2011, which was discussed in our 2011 Form 10-K. Summing up, since the business review in February, much has changed at the macro level with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, persistently high inflation, higher interest rates and the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act. Despite these headwinds, we have executed well in 2022. As we plan for 2023, we anticipate that these headwinds will continue. We're adapting our operating plans and expect to successfully execute against them. Like previous years, we expect to provide 2023 guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen remains strong. I thank our millions of patients for their courage and my 25,000 colleagues for their mission-driven work on behalf of those patients every day. This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Murdo. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Peter. We saw strong volume growth in the third quarter with an 8% increase year-on-year. We delivered record quarterly sales for 11 products, including EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, AMGEVITA, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO; and double-digit volume growth for several additional products, including Repatha and LUMAKRAS. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, third quarter global product sales grew 1% as our volume increases were offset by a 5% decline in net selling price, consistent with our prior estimates. Including the 2% negative foreign exchange impact, product sales declined 1% year-over-year. I'll start now with our general medicine business, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and Aimovig. Overall revenue for this portfolio grew 14% year-over-year driven by 20% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 7% year-over-year driven by 8% volume growth. EVENITY, which complements Prolia in our bone portfolio, had record sales of $201 million for the quarter driven by 45% volume growth in the U.S. and 30% volume growth outside of the U.S. Repatha sales increased 14% year-over-year driven by 52% volume growth, which was partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., we generated 32% volume growth aided by broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. We also saw declining net selling prices in the U.S. as we offered higher rebates to support broad Medicare Part D and commercial patient access. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect less year-over-year U.S. price erosion than we saw in 2022. Outside the U.S., sales of Repatha grew 26% driven by 73% volume growth. Net price declines outside the U.S. were primarily a result of Repatha's inclusion on China's National Reimbursement Drug List as of January 1, 2022. Overall, we remain focused on addressing leading cause of morbidity and mortality by bringing Repatha to patients in need all around the world. Moving to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla sales increased 3% year-over-year for the quarter. Otezla saw 9% volume growth, partially offset by lower inventory and unfavorable foreign exchange impact. In the U.S., Otezla remains the leader in bio-naive psoriasis patient share, and we see broader adoption of Otezla among patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Looking forward, we expect continued strong volume growth given Otezla's established safety profile, strong payer coverage and unique position as the only systemic oral that can treat a broad spectrum of patients with psoriasis regardless of the severity of their disease. ENBREL sales decreased 14% year-over-year for the third quarter driven by lower net selling price, unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and a 3% decline in volume. ENBREL remains an important product for patients due to its long track record of efficacy and safety. I'm very pleased with our strong U.S. launch of TEZSPIRE, which generated $55 million of sales in the third quarter. Allergists and pulmonologists have prescribed TEZSPIRE across a broad range of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We're also seeing initiation in both biologic-naive and previously treated patients. Physicians acknowledge TEZSPIRE's unique differentiated profile and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe asthma who are uncontrolled without requiring any phenotypic and biomarker testing. We recently completed our acquisition of ChemoCentryx, which adds TAVNEOS to our portfolio. TAVNEOS recently launched as a first-in-class treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis, or AAV. This is a serious systemic autoimmune disease that leads to inflammation and eventual destruction of small blood vessels. This inflammatory disease can lead to permanent organ damage and, in some severe cases, can be life-threatening. TAVNEOS represents a significant advance in treatment for the 8,000 to 10,000 U.S. patients a year who develop severe active disease or experience major relapses of AAV. AAV is often managed by rheumatologists and nephrologists, where Amgen has a strong market presence and successful track record. We look forward to applying our deep expertise and inflammation experience to help many more patients manage AAV with TAVNEOS. Moving to our hematology and oncology business. Our 6 innovative products grew 8% year-over-year with 10% volume growth. For Vectibix and Nplate, strong volume growth in the quarter benefited from timing of shipments to our partners in Japan. Our launch of LUMAKRAS is progressing well with revenues of $75 million in the third quarter. Quarter-over-quarter sales declined 3% driven by lower net selling price due to a $12 million unfavorable price adjustment resulting from our reimbursement approval in Germany. This was partially offset by 15% volume growth. In the U.S., LUMAKRAS has been prescribed to over 3,700 patients by over 2,200 clinicians in both academic and community settings. Outside the U.S., LUMAKRAS has now been approved in over 45 countries. We've launched in 30 markets and are rapidly pursuing reimbursement in the remaining markets. As we've noted before, near term, the market for LUMAKRAS is focused on the 7,000 U.S. and 20,000 ex U.S. patients in the second-line setting. Longer term, we expect LUMAKRAS growth to come from earlier-line therapy and the potential of LUMAKRAS to treat other tumor types. Sales of our oncology biosimilars declined 25% year-over-year. While our biosimilars for MVASI and KANJINTI both hold leading shares, we expect continued net selling price deterioration and accelerating volume declines driven by increased competition. The most recently published average selling price for MVASI in the U.S. declined 37% year-over-year and for KANJINTI declined 38% year-over-year. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. We're preparing ourselves for the upcoming launch of AMGEVITA, our HUMIRA biosimilar, in the U.S. in early 2023, followed by the next wave of biosimilar launches to STELARA, EYLEA and SOLIRIS. Overall, I'm very pleased with our execution in the quarter. Our international presence and diverse portfolio of products position us well to deliver on the execution of our long-term growth strategy. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave. David Reese : Thanks, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by welcoming our new colleagues from ChemoCentryx. We're excited that you're now part of Amgen. For research and development, the third quarter was one of continued execution where we presented new data on several programs and continued to progress our innovative clinical pipeline. Beginning with general medicine. This coming weekend at the American Heart Association meeting, we plan to present data from a Phase II study of Olpasiran, a lipoprotein little a targeting small interfering RNA molecule in subjects with elevated Lp little a. We also plan to present additional data from the Repatha FOURIER and Repatha open-label extension studies highlighting the association between the significant and sustained achievement of low and very low LDL cholesterol levels and lower rates of major cardiovascular events. Data from the single- and multiple-dose cohorts of the Phase I study of AMG 133, a multispecific that inhibits the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor, or GIPR, and activates the GLP-1 receptor, will be presented at the 20th World Congress on Insulin Resistance, Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Hybrid Conference in December. As a reminder, the unique aspect of AMG 133 is the inhibition of GIPR, an innovative approach that we chose to take based on human genetic data that suggest decreased expression of GIPR leads to lower body mass index and lower weight. We look forward to discussing the Repatha and Olpasiran data along with an update on AMG 133 at our investor call scheduled for Monday, November 7. Turning to inflammation. In September, we presented data from the Phase III SPROUT trial, where Otezla treatment resulted in significant improvement in measures of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis at week 16 compared to placebo in children's ages 6 to 17. We also presented data from the Otezla Phase III DISCRETE trial, where 16-week data demonstrated statistically significant improvements in genital psoriasis, including skin, itch and quality of life in patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Based on these results, discussion of the FDA is ongoing for DISCRETE to add clinical data to the U.S. prescribing information, and discussions with regulatory authorities globally for SPROUT are forthcoming. In September, TEZSPIRE was approved in the European Union and in Japan, and regulatory reviews continue in other jurisdictions. In oncology, we presented data from tarlatamab, a DLL3-targeting BiTE molecule being studying in patients with small cell lung cancer. These data demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity with notable response durability and survival. In this setting, tarlatamab delivered a confirmed overall response rate of 23%, a median duration of response of 13 months and a median overall survival of 13.2 months. We continue to enroll patients in a potentially registrational Phase II study in this setting. We're also investigating tarlatamab in combination with standard of care in first-line small cell lung cancer in combination with AMG 404, a PD-1 inhibitor, in patients with second-line or later small cell lung cancer and in neuroendocrine prostate cancer. In August, we presented data from our LUMAKRAS checkpoint inhibitor and SHIP2 combination studies. Based on these data, we continue to explore LUMAKRAS in both settings. In September, we presented data on LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix, where this combination demonstrated encouraging efficacy and safety in patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Phase III trial continues to enroll using this combination. We also presented data from the global Phase III CodeBreaK 200 confirmatory trial, where LUMAKRAS treatment led to increased progression-free survival and a significantly higher objective response rate in patients with KRAS G12C mutated non-small cell lung cancer compared with docetaxel. Patient-reported outcomes were also improved with LUMAKRAS versus docetaxel. We've just received initial top line data from a post-marketing requirement study comparing the 960-milligram daily dose of LUMAKRAS with a lower dose of 240 milligrams daily in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Following discussions with regulators, we are planning to submit data from this study along with CodeBreaK 200 confirmatory Phase III data. As a reminder, we are investigating multiple potential to pass the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with LUMAKRAS, potentially segmented by PD-L1 expression levels, where the non-small cell lung cancer population breaks down into roughly 1/3 across PD-L1 high expressers, intermediate or low expressers, and PD-L1-negative expression. We've seen promising early data in the PD-L1-negative population and are planning to initiate a Phase III study of LUMAKRAS plus chemotherapy in first-line advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that the primary analysis of a Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 938, an investigational biosimilar to EYLEA compared with EYLEA, met its primary end point in subjects with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. With these data and previously announced Phase III data from our biosimilar candidates to SOLIRIS and STELARA, we have completed our goal of delivering positive Phase III data from 3 biosimilars in 2022. In conclusion, with an innovative portfolio or approximately 3/4 of our clinical stage programs have first-in-class potential and a growing portfolio of biosimilars, we are well positioned to continue to deliver important new medicines for patients and growth for shareholders over the near and long term. I'll now turn it back to Bob. Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, David. And Jason, why don't we now open the line up for questions. If you would remind our callers of the procedure, we can get started. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Salveen Richter : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On AMG 133 in obesity, could you just help us understand how you'll evaluate the data in the context of existing therapies to make a move forward decision and how you're thinking about differentiation here? Is it just a matter of taking a piece of the market given size? Or do you think there's other aspects here to the program? Bob Bradway : Dave, why don't you take that question? David Reese : Yes. Thanks, Salveen. We know there's a lot of interest in this program. And as we mentioned, we'll be showing the data in full in the first week of December at the hybrid conference. Obesity is a large, very heterogeneous disease. It's a global public health problem. The things that I would look for in evaluating this molecule going forward will be the dosing; dosing interval; what are the kinetics of weight loss; how rapid is that weight loss; what is sustainability. And then finally, the overall tolerability. We do plan on using our extensive capabilities in human data to help shape our thinking and guide this development program as we move forward. Salveen Richter : Thank you. Arvind Sood : Jason, we'll take the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Matthew Harrison : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question now that you've been through - or hopefully been through most of the contracting season for next year. I think one of the key investor concerns is obviously with biosimilar HUMIRA coming next year, what impact that could have to ENBREL and ENBREL pricing dynamics for next year. So I'm wondering if you can just comment on how to think about the potential impact to ENBREL and its pricing next year? Thanks. Murdo Gordon : Thank you, Matthew. It's Murdo. We're obviously excited about the opportunity to launch the first biosimilar to HUMIRA. And so we are active in our discussions with payers and PBMs for that. We are not seeing a massive amount of change to ENBREL's access going forward, and we continue to believe we've got good regard on the payers and PBMs for the efficacy and the safety of ENBREL. And if there were to be a change in ENBREL pricing, it would be for volume gains. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're declining in volumes about 3% year-on-year. Our goal is to maintain that and maybe even improve upon it. But we're not quite finished in the contracting cycle. Arvind Sood : Okay. Next question please? Operator : Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Your line is now open. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a two part question on what everybody wants to talk about, which is obesity. So Lilly and Novo, the two lead players in the GLP space, they both have early-stage programs. I'm talking Phase I stage programs on triple agonist, et cetera. And one thing they always emphasize is that they have certain predefined thresholds for moving any of those programs forward. And those thresholds are off of incremental efficacy beyond the current most competitive products out there. And my question is, I imagine you're thinking about some of those thresholds too relative to Manjaro, perhaps Carsem, as you think about the progression of your program. And I'm curious if you could speak to that. And secondly, if you could just clarify for us, the low- and the high-dose data from single ascending dose you showed at your business review early in the year, was that an average of the first three and the highest three of the six cohorts in Phase I? Or was it the first two out of the six cohorts? I wasn't quite sure with the low and the high meant within the single ascending dose. And I remember, there were 6 different cohorts within single ascending. Thank you very much. David Reese : Yes. We'll get back to you on the latter half of that question. I'll remember off the top of my head, Umer, what that is. But we're going to have -- in a month, you'll have the full data set with all of the cohorts broken out. So I think, at that point, it will be very clear. In terms of thresholds, as I discussed a short while ago, there are many potential avenues to differentiation here. Of course, degree of weight loss is one of them; but also dosing interval; what the kinetics are; importantly, durability; importantly, tolerability, since a fair number of patients transition off of these agents for tolerability. So those are the sorts of things that we'll be taking a look at as we assess whether we've got a differentiated product and it's worth our scale investment. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Michael Yee : Thank you. I'm going to ask another follow-up on 133. David, last quarter, you said you actually started the Phase II. I actually didn't hear that here. Can you just talk about the actual status of where you are with 133 and also the fact that I believe it's been disclosed that you dialed back the GLP-1 potency, so we should not be expecting material, diabetes types effects, and this is not what we're looking for or people should be examining or scrutinizing? Thank you. David Reese : Yes. No, I don't believe we announced we had started Phase II, Mike, but rather that we're in planning. We do expect to initiating the Phase II trial in the relative near term. And once that gets launched, of course, we'll talk about design and give guidance in terms of expected data availability. I wouldn't over think the GLP-1 component, and I'm not sure that's on point. I think, again, when we share the data in a month, you'll get a look at that. Michael Yee : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Jay Olson : Hey, congrats on the quarter and closing the ChemoCentryx deal. You have a lot of volume growth outside the U.S. in the third quarter. And as an example, I think you said Repatha grew 73% ex U.S. with inclusion on China's National Drug Reimbursement List. Can you talk about the pace of product launches outside the U.S. and volume growth and how do you expect U.S. versus ex U.S. revenue mix to evolve over time? Thank you. Bob Bradway : Do you want to - yes, jump in. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Jay. I think Repatha is a good example of how now with our broadened international presence, we're able to bring new products and new launches to the market fairly quickly. What we're seeing in China is rapid expansion of Repatha. Recall, we were on the market for just over a year prior to securing national reimbursement drug list. So we did establish good understanding education, awareness of Repatha. We were promoting it primarily for percutaneous coronary intervention patients or stent patients, where the unmet need was deemed to be highest amongst the private cash pay patient group. But I think what you're seeing is there's real demand in these markets to help millions of patients who are at very high risk of coronary vascular disease. And so we're continuing to build out our business in Japan and China. We had good volume growth in Europe. And obviously, we also had good volume growth in the U.S. So we're excited about the evolution of Repatha, and we continue to feel good about how that product will drive volume and revenue growth for us in the future. With respect to other launches, the other good example that we're seeing is just the LUMAKRAS launch given that we've got approval in roughly 40 markets, we've got reimbursement in roughly 30 markets, and we're pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries. Our teams -- our oncology teams around the world doing a very nice job of identifying KRAS G12C second-line patients and making sure that they have LUMAKRAS as a treatment option. So I'm really pleased that the international presence we've been building for many years now is in full place, is functioning at a high level and delivering strong volume growth. Going forward, we have some partner products where we don't necessarily have the launches in every country where we have our partners to do that. But wherever Amgen has the global responsibility and rights for products, we're feeling very good about our potential and ability to launch them globally. Bob Bradway : And Jay, let me just add, don't forget, we've - in the slides that we shared with you tefan [ph] we have the outside U.S. data available for you on all the different products. You'll see the current contribution from the international business there. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoffrey Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, this is Charlie on for Geoff. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. I just have questions regarding the, I guess, the EYLEA as well as STELARA kind of potential launch timing. I think given you mentioned that you already submitted the STELARA data to the FDA, I'm wondering you're expecting to see the product launch kind of second half of next year and whether you anticipate any pushback from J&J? And I guess similarly kind of for EYLEA, were like launch timing is in the 2024 time frame and if you anticipate kind of any pushback from Regeneron? Thank you. Murdo Gordon : Thanks for the question, Charlie. We're obviously pleased with the successful data readouts on those products and some that have been filed. We expect to be in the first wave of those biosimilar launches, and we're not disclosing specific launch timing on those products. Operator : Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital. Your line is now open. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. I'm not going to ask about 133 but rather on LUMAKRAS. So you had mentioned you had data from the dose-reduction trial. Can you characterize how we should think about the relative efficacy of the lower doses versus the approved dose? And on the pembro combination trial, I noticed in the slides, you talked about a dose expansion with a lower dose lead-in. Are you also treating in combination with that lower dose? David Reese : Yes. Thanks, Evan. Look, we understand there's a lot of interest in the dose comparison data. We're just getting the top line results to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. So it's premature to share these data prior to their review and the appropriate conversations. In regards to the combination trial, I believe you're referring to with checkpoint inhibitors, we're doing a lower dose lead-in, as I've mentioned before, and then layering on top of that dosing the checkpoint inhibitors. So they are then given concurrently going forward. Evan Seigerman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter result. So I have a question regarding the 30%-plus year over decline that we have seen with the -- a couple of biosimilars. Is it on expected lives 3 or 4 years after launch? And how should we think about the other biosimilars you have in your portfolio? How should we think about the long-term pricing dynamic there? Because it was an expectation that the pricing would probably stabilize after a certain point, but it doesn't seem like that in biosimilar. Murdo Gordon : Thanks for the question, Mohit. I think what's important to remember when you're thinking at least about U.S. biosimilars is products in the buy and bill or medical benefit side will continue to see price declines over time because of the way in which the average selling price calculation works. Products on the pharmacy benefit side, so think Medicare Part D products or commercial-insured retail pharmacy products, they are likely to have slower declines in the slope of their net price over time. Now both of those conditions depend on how many competitors for each molecule. So everyone is a little bit different. But I would hesitate to put a time frame on the class of products. I think you need to look at each one of the molecules. One thing I will say is we've been very clear on where we're going to get growth in our biosimilars portfolio, and that's by launching successive new biosimilars on top of our continuing base of business. Outside the U.S., biosimilar pricing tends to come down fairly rapidly and then can hold in some of the larger, what we call retail markets. In markets where it's a heavy tender business, prices will continue to decline as long as there are competitors in the market. Operator : Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Cowen. Yaron Werber : I got just a couple maybe. David, the first one on 133, can you comment it's an antibody? Can we assume it's monthly dosing? And then secondly, for 938 against EYLEA, now that there's going to be high-dose EYLEA, the 8 milligrams approved, it's obviously the same underlying drug, just a different formulation. How does that impact what you need to do to bring in a high-dose 938 to market and how that jives versus the fiscal year '25 potential launch? David Reese : Yes. Let me take the first part on 133. It's -- as I said, it's a multispecific or bifunctional molecule, meaning it's got an antibody component that inhibits the GIPR receptor. And then there's a component that agonizes GLP-1. So as you noted, you can expect antibody-like pharmacokinetics, and we'll be sharing all of that in a month. But that's what will drive the dosing interval. On 938, let me ask Murdo to comment briefly on that. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Yaron, we continue to want to be able to have a full complement of competitive biosimilar products that compete effectively with their innovative parent products. And we've, I think, done that very successfully, thanks to the talented team in our formulation and process development organization. So we feel confident that we'll be able to bring various concentrations across the portfolio as needed. So we're working on that one. Operator : Our next question comes from David Risinger with SVB Securities. Your line is now open. David Risinger : Great, thanks very much. So my question is on biosimilars timing for 2023, please. Regarding AMGEVITA, in light of your interchangeability study, which has an estimated completion in January, assuming that succeeds, when in 2023 do you think FDA will add interchangeability to the label? And then is Amgen planning to launch biosimilar STELARA in September at risk if patent litigation remains outstanding? Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks again for the question. Maybe take the second part first. We haven't made any statements about when we will launch our biosimilar to STELARA, but we're pleased that we've got strong data in hand, and we're pleased that we've got the strength of the Amgen manufacturing network and commercial organization ready to go. And we'll track that space closely. We expect to be in the first wave of launches on STELARA, EYLEA and SOLIRIS, the next wave of new biosimilar launches. And we expect to be in the market in early Feb in the new year with AMGEVITA. The interchangeability stat is an interesting one. I think over time, that may grow in importance. But being first with AMGEVITA, we understand it to be of lower priority from payers and PBMs. But we do expect to have interchangeability in a relevant time frame for when the other biosimilar entrants to HUMIRA come into the market. Operator : Next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist. Robyn Karnauskas : Just going to follow up with you on the ENBREL comment ahead of the biosimilar HUMIRA launch. We've heard that ENBREL is often used as a third- or second-line TNF. And so I was just curious whether -- you've noted that you don't expect further pricing declines, but that part of it is when ENBREL - HUMIRA launches that really you're already having a flow-through HUMIRA get to ENBREL in many cases, and that's why there may not be motivations have to compete on price. Just sort of clear -- that's a detailed question. Maybe help me understand the dynamics there. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Robyn, thanks for the opportunity to clarify. I didn't say that we don't expect continued price declines on ENBREL. I said we don't expect the current price declines to be dramatically different going into next year. So we do expect to continue to concede price on ENBREL as the category is quite competitive, but we don't see the slope of that changing dramatically. And ENBREL is used across a broad range of patient types in rheumatoid arthritis as well as in psoriatic arthritis. I think what we see is we see a lot of frontline usage still, and we do see some post-TNF frontline usage. So I think that will continue. Not every patient is going to respond to TNF inhibitor, and many clinicians prefer the well-demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of ENBREL, and we think that will continue despite biosimilar options in the market. So that hopefully clarifies your question. Operator : Our next question comes from Colin Bristow with UBS. Your line is now open. Colin Bristow : Hey, good afternoon. Congrats on the quarter. So I'll take another one on 133, if I may. As we think about time line, it took Lilly and Novo around 5 to 6 years to move their lips from sort of Phase I initiation to the market. Is there any reason at all for us to think that there's any sort of abbreviated path here that you could explore? And just with those sort of aforementioned time lines in mind and the fact that this efficacy bar that we see now could be raised by what are the competitor assets is ahead of you, does this raise the bar for progression to Phase II from your side? David Reese : Yes. Thanks for the question. The -- I think -- let me start with, again, the disease itself, obesity, which is a very heterogeneous disease. Obviously, it's one of the major public health problems globally right now. Our belief is that there are a number of diseases tucked within the label of obesity. Some patients have primarily cardiovascular manifestations; others, type 2 diabetes; others, mechanical problems. And so as I noted, we will be using our human data capabilities to further understand and potentially segment these populations to determine if there can be a particular benefit in subsegments of patients. And then I would just remind you of the things that we'll look for in this program as we go forward to see whether we have a differentiated molecule or not, dosing; again, the kinetics, in particular, pidity [ph] and sustainability of weight loss; and then overall tolerability. Those are the things that we'll be looking at as we take a look at Phase II data and determine as the field unfolds where we go from there. Operator : Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open. Carter Gould : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Sorry to beat a dead horse here, but to follow up on the prior question, how important is it that you also pursue diabetes alongside an obesity indication? Or do you feel like you could just go after obesity and that might be able to suffice and work out commercially? David Reese : Yes. Thanks, Carter. That's a question we'll address it as we go forward. But I don't feel that it's essential that this be a diabetes medication. As I said, this is -- obesity powers a large number of diseases, and we're going to guide our development to where we think we get the most effect size. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim. Unidentified Analyst : This is Ted on for Michael. We have [won] LUMAKRAS coming out of World conference with updated data on different combinations you presented, I mean, PD-1 and SHIP2. How do you think these different combo regimens can be positioned to develop each other? Do you have any updated view? And would you prioritize one over the other with data so far? David Reese : Yes. No, in terms of the combination, SHIP2 checkpoint inhibitor combinations, we're enrolling Phase II trial now with the SHIP2 combination that will guide our development. That's a combination that could potentially be applied regardless of PD-L1 expression levels. And then as I mentioned, we are exploring in the PD-L1-positive population a low-dose run-in of LUMAKRAS then followed by layering on of the checkpoint inhibitor. And as those trials enroll, I'll provide guidance in terms of when we have data readouts. And those data will determine how we think about the first-line population. Finally, let me remind everyone again that in the PD-L1-negative population, we're going to be looking at a chemotherapy plus LUMAKRAS combination. Arvind Sood : Jason, I see one more participant in the queue. So let's take one last question, after which Bob will make some closing comments. Operator : Our final question is from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Tim Anderson : I wanted to ask a two part biosimilar question related just to the U.S. market, and that's what you think uptake will be like in 2 disease areas that are a little different than most. So in the rare disease space, where you'll have a biosimilar SOLIRIS and then in the eye space with your biosimilar EYLEA, how do you think those will compare to disease areas where we already have precedents, such as in oncology? I know the ice pace is buy and bill. I think rare diseases is not buy and both, but if you could compare those, please. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks, Tim, for the question. As I mentioned before, you do have to look at each product slightly individually in the circumstances that would generate or drive uptick. If we go back to the oncology biosimilars, we had an assumption at the beginning of those products that patients may not get switched on the maintenance phase of their treatment, so mid-cycle or mid-course of treatment. And what we saw, at least in the buy-and-bill space, for both MVASI and KANJINTI that -- was that oncologists were comfortable with the quality of the Amgen biosimilars and by the fact that they had access to our medical teams and our salespeople who are out there calling on them to help them understand the data behind our biosimilars. And so we did see mid-course of treatment switching to our biosimilars. So I think the threshold for what we thought would be a hesitancy on the part of the subscriber was different. And I think that we're looking closely at both SOLIRIS prescribers and EYLEA prescribers. And we've done some in-market research with both customer types, and we feel good about our opportunity to create value for the health care system by offering biosimilar alternatives to those 2 branded products. And we feel good about our chances of having a decent uptake on both. Bob Bradway : Okay. Well, again, let me thank all of you for joining our call. We appreciate your interest in Amgen. And let me just end by saying that we remain focused on ending the year strong and positioning ourselves for a good '23 and beyond. We look forward to having a chance to engage with you again here in a few short weeks or Monday and then in a few short weeks thereafter, at various conferences. So thank you and we'll look forward to seeing you soon. Arvind Sood : Thanks, everybody. Operator : This concludes our 2022 Q3 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind Sood : Okay. Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our call to discuss the results for Q4 and full year 2022. 2022 was once again a year exemplified by great execution despite some of the macro challenges. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will make some opening comments, followed by prepared comments from other members of our senior leadership team. You should have received a link to our slides that we have posted. Through the course of our discussion, we will make some forward-looking statements and use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and just a reminder that actual results can vary materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Arvind and hello, everyone and thank you for joining our call. So beginning the year feeling confident about the long-term growth outlook for our business and let me offer 5 reasons why. First, we have a number of innovative volume-driven products that still have plenty of room to run and we saw that in 2022. Repatha, Prolia and EVENITY each generated double-digit sales and volume growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We expect continued growth from these products in 2023 and beyond with Repatha, in particular, helped by important new data from the FOURIER open-label extension study and new prescribing guidelines. OTEZLA delivered 7% volume growth in both the fourth quarter and the full year, benefiting from a label expansion that gives us the opportunity to reach millions of new patients in the U.S. with mild to moderate psoriasis. LUMAKRAS and TEZSPIRE collectively contributed more than $450 million in full year sales and we're pursuing additional indications for both products. We're especially pleased to see TEZSPIRE being utilized by patients across all types of severe asthma. Murdo will share more about the performance of our in-line products in a moment. Second, we moved 6 first-in-class molecules into Phase III or potentially registration-enabling trials in 2022, including Olpasiran for LP(a), rocatinlimab for atopic dermatitis, TEZSPIRE in eosinophilic esophagitis and of course, bemarituzimab, tarlatimab in BLINCYTO in cancer. We've also begun enrolling patients in a Phase II trial for AMG 133. Based on early data, this molecule, with its unique mechanism of action, looks like it may have an attractive profile for the treatment of obesity. And more on our pipeline from Dave Reese in a moment. Third, we have an industry-leading biosimilars business that will contribute to our growth over time. In 2022, we delivered positive Phase III data for our biosimilar candidates to EYLEA, SOLIRIS and STELARA, positioning us to be in the first wave of these launches which we know is critical to success. We're also less than 24 hours into the launch of AMGEVITA in the U.S. and AMGEVITA is the leading biosimilar to HUMIRA internationally. And with a 5-month lead over the next entrant, we're well positioned for success in the U.S. All told, we have 6 more biosimilar launches planned in the U.S. and markets around the world between now and the end of the decade, making this another source of long-term growth for us. Fourth, we've often said that we would look to licensing and acquisitions in our stated areas of strategic interest. And that's what we've done, building on our decades of experience in inflammation with 2 significant transactions that will strengthen our presence in this space. Through the acquisition of ChemoCentryx, we added TAVNEOS, a first-in-class treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis and we're off to a strong start there. Our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will add several additional first-in-class early in life cycle biologic medicines, including TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA that will add to our growth profile through 2030 and beyond. We're working our way through the regulatory review processes for that deal and are confident that the deal poses no anticompetitive matters. And we have received a second request from the U.S. FTC and we'll work with them to answer their questions while remaining optimistic that we can complete the deal in the first half of the year. Finally, we've stayed true to our capital allocation priorities, investing in our business to drive long-term growth while also returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and a growing dividend. You'll hear more from Peter on this shortly. And everything we achieved last year and everything we will achieve going forward is due to the hard work and commitment of our people. They're passionate about our mission to serve patients. They're clear on how their work contributes to our success and they're ready to seize the opportunities and meet the challenges that await us. I'm grateful to all of them. I look forward to your questions a little later on but now let me turn the call over to Murdo. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Bob. 2022 was another year of strong execution of our mission to bring [indiscernible] products to the millions of patients in the world who suffer from gravest illness. The evolution of our portfolio continue by record sales for 16 brands. We saw strong volume gains across our general medicine and hematology-oncology growth brands. Our inflammation therapeutic area expanded with the launch of TEZSPIRE and the acquisition of TAVNEOS, 2 first-in-class medicines that treat serious disease. In addition, our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will add several important medicines to our portfolio. In total, volume growth for 2022 was 9% with 7% growth in the U.S. and 14% growth ex U.S. as we continue to deliver on our international growth strategy. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, full year global product sales grew 4% as our volume increases were offset by a 5% decline in net selling price. Including the 2% negative foreign exchange impact, product sales increased 2% year-over-year. In the quarter, we also saw strong volume growth with a 10% increase year-on-year. Starting with our general medicine business which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and Aimovig, overall revenue for these 4 products grew 21% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year, driven by 19% and 21% volume growth, respectively. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 14% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven primarily by 11% volume growth. EVENITY which complements Prolia in our bone portfolio, had record sales of $225 million for the quarter, driven by strong volume growth across markets. Repatha sales increased 22% year-over-year for the fourth quarter with volume growth of 31%, partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., we generated volume growth of 32% for the fourth quarter, aided by broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. We saw declining net selling prices in the U.S. as we offered higher rebates to support broad Medicare Part D and commercial patient access. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect less year-over-year U.S. price erosion than we saw in 2022. Outside the U.S., fourth quarter sales of Repatha grew 36% year-over-year, driven by 31% volume growth. Globally, Repatha has treated over 1.5 million patients since launch. Repatha's strong prescribing history in cardiology and expanding use in the primary care setting position us well to bring Repatha to more patients globally. With the FOURIER long-term follow-up data, in addition to evolving and more aggressive treatment guidelines, there's a clear rationale that lowering LDL cholesterol as much and as early as possible with Repatha will reduce cardiovascular risk for patients around the world. Transitioning to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla sales decreased 2% year-over-year for the quarter and increased 2% for the full year. We saw 7% volume growth in both periods. This was offset by lower net selling price, stemming from enhancements to our co-pay and patient assistance programs to support new patients starting treatment as well as additional rebates to improve the quality of coverage. During the fourth quarter, our U.S. Otezla business was impacted by new patient demand from 3 drug programs by newly launched topical and systemic competition. We expect that impact to continue in Q1 of 2023. We also expect to see the typical pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due primarily to the effect of insurance reverifications, co-pays and deductibles for patients. The combined effect could lead to first quarter Otezla sales being similar to or below those from Q1 of 2022. Longer term, we continue to see strong growth potential for Otezla, given its established safety profile, strong payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and ease of administration. Otezla remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well positioned to help the 4 million U.S. patients with mild to moderate psoriasis, 1.5 million of whom have psoriasis that cannot be optimally addressed by a topical and can benefit from a first-line systemic treatment like Otezla. ENBREL sales decreased 1% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by declines in volume and net selling price, partially offset by higher year-end inventory levels. ENBREL remains an important product for patients due to its long track record of efficacy and safety. TEZSPIRE continues its strong launch with $79 million in sales in the fourth quarter and $170 million for the full year. Allergists and pulmonologists have prescribed TEZSPIRE across a broad range of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We're also seeing initiation of TEZSPIRE in both biologic-naive and previously treated patients. Physicians acknowledge TEZSPIRE unique differentiated profile and has broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe uncontrolled asthma without any phenotypic and biomarker limitations. We're now preparing for the anticipated U.S. approval of the prefilled pen in the first quarter which will offer patients the convenient option to administer TEZSPIRE at home. Sales of TAVNEOS were $21 million in the fourth quarter. Our integration of ChemoCentryx is proceeding smoothly, confirming our belief that Amgen's deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence will allow us to bring TAVNEOS to more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. We're also excited about our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics. Our combined portfolio which will include [indiscernible] will address serious inflammatory diseases and improve the lives of many patients. Amgen's commercial capabilities and global presence in approximately 100 markets [ph] will allow our combined team to deliver important therapies that will make a meaningful difference for more patients globally. Today, we announced the launch of AMGEVITA, the first U.S. biosimilar to HUMIRA, a medicine used by more than 1 million patients living with serious inflammatory diseases. With our track record of developing and manufacturing biologics and decades of experience in inflammation, Amgen is uniquely equipped to supply patients with this biosimilar medicine. AMGEVITA is the first significant U.S. biosimilar in the pharmacy benefit space and we expect gradual uptake in the coming months as this market evolves. Moving to our hematology and oncology business which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO. These 6 innovative products grew 14% year-over-year with 17% volume growth for the quarter. Full year sales grew 13%, driven by volume gains. KYPROLIS sales grew 14% in the fourth quarter. Nplate sales in the fourth quarter included $207 million related to a onetime order from the U.S. government. Given the strong performance of our hem/onc portfolio in 2022 and the recent positive data on both BLINCYTO and Vectibix, I look forward to the future growth potential of this portfolio. LUMAKRAS reported $71 million in sales in the fourth quarter and $285 million for the full year. Quarter-over-quarter sales declined 5% with 12% volume growth, more than offset by a lower net selling price driven by a $12 million unfavorable price adjustment resulting from a reimbursement approval decision in France and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. Outside the U.S., LUMAKRAS has now been approved in over 45 countries. We've launched LUMAKRAS in 30 markets and are rapidly pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries. As we've noted before, the market for LUMAKRAS focused on the 7,000 U.S. and 20,000 ex U.S. patients in the second-line setting. Longer term, we expect LUMAKRAS growth to come from moving into earlier lines of therapy and expanding into additional tumor types. Sales of our oncology biosimilars declined 40% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 30% for the full year, driven by lower price. While our biosimilars for MVASI and KANJINTI both hold leading shares, we expect continued net selling price deterioration and accelerating volume declines, driven by increased competition. The most recently published average selling price in the U.S. declined 38% year-over-year for MVASI and 51% for KANJINTI. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. And as we start the new year, I'm inspired by the hard work of the thousands of Amgen employees around the world who wake up every day to serve our patients. Our expanding international presence and diverse portfolio of products, further strengthened by the integration of ChemoCentryx and the announced acquisition of Horizon, position us well to serve many more patients globally. And with that, I'll turn it to Dave. David Reese : Thanks, Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. For research and development, last year was one of high-quality execution and on-time delivery of results as we continued to progress our innovative pipeline. In general medicine, we strengthened our cardiovascular franchise and emerging portfolio of obesity assets, 2 areas of significant unmet need, affecting millions of patients globally. Repatha, of course, is the cornerstone of these efforts. And last November at AHA, we presented FOURIER open-label extension data. These data were recognized by the American College of Cardiology expert consensus decision pathway which indicated there appears to be no LDL cholesterol level below which benefit ceases. Additionally, LDL cholesterol recommendations were updated to reflect a reduction in target LDL levels in highest-risk patients from 70 to 55 milligrams per deciliter. This is a level that is not attainable for a large number of patients without PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. Another molecule that we are excited about is Olpasiran. At AHA, we presented Phase II data where Olpasiran dosed 75 milligrams or higher every 12 weeks reduced Lp(a) concentrations by 95% to 100% in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with baseline Lp(a) levels of approximately 260 nanomolars per liter. Olpasiran appeared both safe and well tolerated in this study. We are encouraged by these data, particularly our dosing frequency, safety and tolerability profile and degree of Lp(a) reduction. We have initiated a Phase III outcome study and 6,000 subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and significantly elevated Lp(a) levels of at least 200 nanomolars per liter. Now turning to obesity. In December, we presented data from a Phase I study where AMG 133 appeared safe, well-tolerated and demonstrated a 14.5% reduction in body weight at day 85 following 3 monthly subcutaneous injections. Body weight reductions were observed up to 150 days after the final AMG 133 administration. Given these favorable attributes, we are now enrolling a 570-subject Phase II study to explore AMG 133 in patients with obesity with or without diabetes and related comorbidities. The study will also investigate different dosing levels and regimens\u2026 [Technical Difficulty] Peter Griffith : \u2026applying 4%. Recall our Q4 2021 results included approximately $200 million of favorable impact to other income and expense resulting from a gain on our Beijing investment. Full year non-GAAP EPS of $17.69 grew 27% versus our re-GAAP [ph] 2021 result. Non-GAAP Q4 operating expenses were unchanged year-over-year while full year non-GAAP operating expenses declined 12%. The full year includes the impacts in 2021 of the $1.5 billion 5-prime IP [ph] R&D charge and the $400 million licensing payment that KKC [ph] for rocatinlimab. We advanced our pipeline and invested in product launch activities in 2022 while delivering a 51% non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product of sale. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 cost of sales as a percent of product sales decreased 1.2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis, down to 16.3%. For the full year, cost of sales as a percentage of product sales decreased by 0.5 percentage points, down to 15.9%. Both the quarter and full year improvements were primarily due to fewer COVID-19 antibody shipments and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by changes in our product mix. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the fourth quarter decreased 2% year-over-year, primarily due to higher business development activity in 2021, including our upfront payments in connection with our Genera Biomedicines and Iraqis Therapeutics collaborations, along with lower marketed product support. This was partially offset by higher support for key assets in early- and late-stage programs. However, adjusted for 2021 BD activity, Q4 2022 R&D investment increased 7% year-over-year. And for the full year, non-GAAP R&D spend declined 8% based on the same drivers of the fourth quarter. However, adjusted for BD activity, full year 2022 R&D investment increased by 5%. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 2% year-over-year, driven by higher marketed product support, including investments in our priority products, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY and Repatha. For the full year, SG&A expenses were unchanged year-over-year as increased investments for all priority brands were offset by productivity gains, continuous improvement and reallocation for mature brands. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were about $470 million in expense in the fourth quarter, a $250 million increase year-over-year, primarily driven by the previously mentioned gains in 2021 that we recognized from our investment in BeiGene. For the full year, non-GAAP other income and expenses were approximately $1.7 billion. So now turning to the outlook for the business for 2023. Our outlook is Amgen-only on a stand-alone basis without any adjustments for the announced Horizon acquisition. It's important to remember that currently -- that current publicly available consensus estimates are derived from a combination of estimates of Amgen as a stand-alone company, along with estimates from some analysts who have already added Horizon into their estimates. So our 2023 revenue guidance is $26.0 billion to $27.2 billion and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $17.40 to $18.60 per share. So now let me review several key points related to our guidance. For total revenue, we expect the year-over-year comparison will not include about $700 million related to several items from 2022 that we do not expect benefit from in 2023. We assume we will not generate COVID-19 antibody revenues in 2023. We also assume a lower amount of Nplate sales in 2023 compared to 2022. Recall, 2022 included a significant purchase of Nplate by the United States government in the second half of the year. Also several favorable changes to estimated sales deductions that occurred in 2022 and the sale of our generics business in Turkey which closed late in 2022. For product sales, we project volume growth at a portfolio level, driven by strong growth in our priority products, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, Repatha, Prolia and TAVNEOS. Consistent with industry trends and our recent history, we expect mid-single-digit price declines in our portfolio in 2023. Turning to Neulasta and our oncology biosimilars. We expect the recent trends to continue through 2023. This will likely result in full year Neulasta sales less than $700 million. Further, we expect less than $750 million in combined product sales for our oncology biosimilars, KANJINTI and MVASI. And finally, we expect product sales of less than $300 million for EPOGEN as we transition through the expiry of our contract with DaVita. For the full year, we're guiding other revenues to a range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Note that we recognized about $300 million of revenue from our COVID antibody collaboration with Lilly in 2022 that we don't anticipate repeating in 2023. So we will continue to manage our operating expenses consistent with our historical cost discipline. So even with increasing 2023 sales volumes, declining net selling prices and inflationary pressures on costs, we still project full year non-GAAP operating expenses to be flat versus 2022 as we continue our focus on driving productivity and cost efficiencies across the enterprise. We project non-GAAP cost of sales to be in the range of 16% to 17% as a percentage of product sales. Recall that we mentioned during our Q3 earnings discussion that tax law changes enacted by Puerto Rico in June 2022 replaced the Puerto Rico Excise Tax, the PRET, in favor of an income tax. This change will increase our income tax expense beginning in 2023 while reducing our cost of sales by roughly an equivalent amount. Note, however, there will be a negative impact in 2023 of approximately $125 million related to the amount of the PRET that is currently capitalized in inventory that will be charged to cost of goods sold in the first half of 2023, with most of the charge recognized in the first quarter without a corresponding tax benefit. We expect non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2023 to increase 3% to 4% year-over-year compared to our 2022 expenses as we advanced a number of the programs Dr. Reese referenced earlier. This is consistent with our first capital allocation priority to invest in the best innovation and our operating expense discipline provides us the capital to do just that. And for non-GAAP SG&A spend, we expect 2023 amounts as a percentage of product sales to slightly decrease year-over-year, driven by productivity improvements. These all lead to a projected non-GAAP operating margin as a percent of product sales of roughly 50% on a full year basis. We expect non-GAAP other income and expense of approximately $1.4 billion. The expected year-over-year improvement is driven by a change in our accounting for our BeiGene investment we are making in 2023. Beginning in January 2023, we'll no longer record our share of BeiGene results in other income and expense under the equity method of accounting on our non-GAAP income statement. We'll now mark to market our investment with the impact recorded only on our GAAP income statement. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 18% to 19%. This rate reflects the new Puerto Rico income tax which as I explained earlier, replaced the PRET beginning in 2023. We expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2023 and we expect that we will continue to meaningfully increase our dividend. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $925 million in 2023, consistent with our capital allocation priority to invest in our business, including in our new environmentally-friendly facilities in Ohio, North Carolina. And after we complete those facilities, we expect our capital expenditures to return to their historical levels. I'd also like to make some specific comments around the first quarter of 2023. I'm encouraged that our business is performing as expected through the first month of the year. However, consistent with our historical revenue patterns, we expect revenue in the first quarter of the year to be the lowest revenue quarter of the year and slightly below revenue in Q1 2022. At a portfolio level, we expect product sales to be unchanged from Q1 2022 and other revenues to be lower on a year-over-year basis due to the reasons set out above, including about $225 million related to COVID antibody sales in the first quarter of 2022. We anticipate about $80 million of foreign exchange headwinds in Q1 2023 compared to Q1 2022. The total of all these items creates greater than $400 million of headwinds versus the first quarter 2022. So these revenue patterns, along with the timing of expenses, are expected to translate into our Q1 non-GAAP operating margin being below 50% as a percentage of product sales, although we continue to expect operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50% for all of 2023. Recall, this is all Amgen stand-alone. We will continue to focus on our legacy of execution excellence. In summary, despite macroeconomic headwinds, we delivered another strong year of financial results in 2022, keeping us on track with our long-term commitments to deliver through 2030 and beyond. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen is strong and we look forward to completing the announced acquisition of Horizon during the first half of 2023 which will only strengthen our growth prospects. We would expect to provide updated guidance as appropriate at some point after the transaction closes. This concludes the financial update. My thanks to our 25,000-plus colleagues at Amgen around the world for their commitment to serving patients and their tireless efforts in 2022. I'll now turn it back over to Bob for our Q&A. Bob Bradway : Okay. Well, thank you, Peter and Dave, for soldiering on despite the technical difficulties. And again, apologies to all of you who've dialed in to join us on the call and who found some disruption in the proceedings here. A number of you have e-mailed your questions to Arvind. What I'd like to suggest is that any of you who have questions, directly e-mail them now to Arvind and Arvind will read them and we'll try to answer them here in the room. And let me just assure all of you that we will rearrange our schedule and be available to answer questions if we don't get to it on this conference call, be available to Arvind and his team to answer questions you may have after we wrap up. So with that, let me turn to Arvind and we'll tackle the questions that you've already submitted. Arvind Sood : Yes. Thanks, Bob. And apologies to everybody for the technical difficulties that we have had. And as Bob said, just please e-mail your questions to me directly. So the first question that we have is from Yaron Werber of Cowen and he submitted 2 questions. His first question is that Amgen will move to fair value from equity method of accounting for BeiGene. As you also now own less than 19.9% equity in BeiGene, will Amgen stop consolidating BeiGene's losses and profits from now on? And then the second question is, can you discuss when you plan to file the high concentration of AMGEVITA once you get the Phase III interchangeable data in the first half of 2023? Bob Bradway : Okay. We do that in 2 pieces. Pete, why don't you hit the accounting question? Peter Griffith : Yes, quick question -- quick answer. Thank you, Yaron, for the question. On BeiGene equity method of accounting, as I said in my remarks, we will record, in our GAAP income statement, the mark-to-market but that won't be recorded in our non-GAAP income statement. So the answer is we will not include any earnings from -- or losses as our share of BeiGene going forward in our non-GAAP income statement. Bob Bradway : Okay. And then on AMGEVITA, why don't we do a 2-parter there? Dave Reese and then Murdo, you may want to add some thoughts. David Reese : Yes. In terms of the filing time lines, once we have the data in hand, we'll be then giving guidance as to when we expect filing and potential approval of that after the appropriate regulatory interactions. It's important, I think, as Bob were put this in context, let me ask Murdo to comment here. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks, Dave. We have had some inbound questions on this, as you can imagine, during the day, given that we are launching. So far, launch is progressing well. We have product making its way into the channel and we're already receiving inbound interest in AMGEVITA from payers, prescribers and patients. One thing that's important to remember is the current product that we have in the market is a lower concentration, original concentration AMGEVITA or adalimumab but it is citrate-free, meaning that the patient experience here is still 1 where we minimize the injection site pain by having a citrate-free formulation. And patient experience here has been positive in our clinical trials and we anticipate that not having a high concentration will not be a barrier in the market. These are very low volumes that are injected through an auto-injectable pen. And we've seen very, very good reliability of patients being able to administer. In addition, of course, we provide nurse support for patients. And then while it wasn't asked, I think it's also important to note that we are providing financial assistance, support and reimbursement support for both prescribers and patients as we launch the product. So really a full suite of services and support that you would expect for a branded launch being applied to the launch of the first biosimilar, adalimumab, to launch in the U.S., that is AMGEVITA. Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Murdo and Dave. Let's go to the next question, Arvind. Arvind Sood : So the next question is from Geoff Meacham [ph] from BofA Merrill Lynch. And his question is, he said, I know you have AMGEVITA but are you expecting an indirect impact in the second half of '23 or the first half of '24 from all the HUMIRA biosimilars and STELARA, on Otezla and ENBREL mainly? And he is interested in the volume and price impact. Bob Bradway : Okay. Murdo, you want to share your thoughts on that? Murdo Gordon : It's hard for me, obviously, to comment on what competitors may do as other biosimilars of adalimumab enter the market beyond July. But what we have seen coming into 2023 is a good cycle of reimbursement negotiations and we've been able to secure a very broad coverage for both ENBREL and Otezla. We expect that insurance coverage to continue throughout the course of 2023. And as is usual, we had small concessions on net price to secure that broad reimbursement but nothing unusual compared to prior years. Arvind Sood : The next question is from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. And he has 2 questions. The first 1 is on Otezla. And Chris says, I know there are a lot of puts and takes on this market and I know you guys have highlighted a tailwind of mild-to-moderate psoriasis patients coming into therapy. But Otezla is kind of unique in that there is a sizable discontinuation rate. Just with that, if you're probably not going away, talk about why we shouldn't be more concerned about [indiscernible] and maybe just as importantly, the next-generation molecules that are coming behind it. Especially noticing that a decline Q-over-Q both in the U.S. and rest of the world, even with a 9% inventory build, any color on how you grow through this coming competition would be very helpful. And then he has a question on AMGEVITA. Murdo Gordon : Okay. So first on Otezla, I would start with the fact that we are the only systemic product indicated for a broad range of psoriasis patients without regard to the severity and really makes us the ideal first-line first systemic post-topical choice of therapy. And that is the positioning of the brand. The size of that market is very large. There's 4 million patients with a mild to moderate form of psoriasis. About 1.5 million of those patients would be regarded as not doing as well as they could on topical treatment by potential switching to a systemic like Otezla. As I mentioned just a few moments ago, Otezla also enjoys very broad frontline access, that is it doesn't require that you step through another systemic therapy. And it also means that prescribers can make it the first choice. And these are busy dermatologists. They want something that's easy. They don't want a lot of prior paperwork. And they want to be able to provide an ability for patients to start quickly on their therapy. Only Otezla offers that in the psoriasis market. I think what we're seeing right now is an effect of a number of free goods programs that were launched at the end of last year and continue into this quarter. When physicians have free goods programs or sometimes referred to as bridging programs, usually used at the beginning of a product launch when there hasn't been an opportunity to secure access with pharmacy benefit managers, physicians will sometimes use those to try novel therapies coming into the market. However, as those novel therapies go through the negotiation process with PBMs and payers, oftentimes, it becomes more difficult to try those novel therapies because of the nature of the access that they result with. And I think that's really where the sustained advantage of Otezla in that first-line systemic post-topical prebiologic patient population really allows us a long-term growth opportunity. And we continue to feel confident in the long-term growth of this brand. And we have a very strong commercial presence in a number of markets around the world and we continue to feel good from what we're hearing from our prescribing base of dermatologists. I will say that the short-term impact of these free good programs, we're watching it very closely and we're making sure that we continue to be competitive in the marketplace. Arvind Sood : Okay. Chris, the second question is the same as the question that we have from Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. And she says on AMGEVITA, could you offer more details on how the dual pricing option will work and drive uptick? And how should we think about net pricing? What are your expectations for the market in midyear once more biosimilars enter? Murdo Gordon : Well, maybe I can answer the second part first. We don't comment on product-specific pricing and so I really can't answer the net price. I think it's fair to say that as additional entrants come into the market, net prices usually go down. We've seen that in our other biosimilars business but we would expect that to happen here. With respect to the 2 list price approach that we've employed here at this launch, this is really to address the complexity of the U.S. market. Pharmacy benefit managers have a business model that requires that they negotiate rebates with manufacturers and so they would prefer a high list price and negotiate rebates to net the price down and then pass those rebates through to their upstream employer clients. There are other stakeholders and customers in the health care system that prefer a net price-based model and don't care about the difference between list and net or gross price and net price. And so for those, we have the lower net price product available. So just a reminder, we have a high list price at 5% below HUMIRA and then we have a low list price at 55% below HUMIRA. We also intend to ensure that AMGEVITA is an affordable medicine for patients by providing co-pay assistance as well as helping patients secure reimbursement through the insurer. We are also pleased to report that we enjoy broad access out of the gate on day 1 of launch with the 3 national pharmacy benefit managers, so broad parity coverage alongside HUMIRA. Bob Bradway : Let me just -- I note that we're up to the half past the hour but we will continue to take questions for as long as necessary here to answer those questions and until there is a recording of this that will be available in the form of a transcript for those of you that have conflicts and can't stay beyond the set time. So Arvind, why don't you go to the next question? Arvind Sood : Yes. The next question is from Colin Bristow for UBS. And here's a question on the obesity pipeline. What update should we expect to get this year? Will we see data from the remaining 3 cohorts from the Phase I study? And then on AMG 786, when should we expect updates, more disclosure on this asset and program? David Reese : Yes. In terms of the obesity pipeline, AMG 133, the 2 additional cohorts you're referring to, I don't know that we'll see data over the course of this year on that. If that changes, of course, I'll provide guidance. AMG 786 is a small molecule with a different mechanism of action, as indicated to GLP-1 or Gipper receptor agonist or antagonist. So that's going through dose escalation over the course of the year. I'll provide guidance in terms of when we may see data from that program. And of course, at the time of data availability, we'll talk about the target as well. Bob Bradway : Okay. Thanks, David. Arvind, let's go to the next question. Arvind Sood : So the next question is from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. And Evan wanted to know, he said with slowing LUMAKRAS sales, can you expand on how you may have revised your commercial strategy to better align with the commercial potential of the assets? Murdo Gordon : Yes. I'm not sure we have a slowing overall volume growth. I think what we saw and I mentioned this, it might not have come through clearly on the audio but in the quarter, we did see a price effect based on reaching reimbursement decision finalization in France. And so we had a $12 million charge in the quarter against LUMAKRAS. It grew 7% volume in the quarter. But I think we anticipated the opportunity for LUMAKRAS in second-line being limited to the incident population. And we are commercially and medically sized appropriately for that opportunity. I think as we expand into earlier lines of therapy or other tumor types, we will continue to invest behind the product. Arvind Sood : Okay. The next question is from Michael Yee. And Michael wants to know, he said, on 2023 guidance, can you clarify what the input is for revenue growth versus EPS growth range? Specifically, is there a positive impact from BeiGene accounting? And does the tax rate of 18% to 19% negatively impact EPS? Or is COGS offset, as explained last year, is 2023 OpEx growing more than revenue? Peter Griffith : Arvind, let me start by working our way from the tax question. So on the tax side of it, the 18% to 19% is increases by the amount. Although, as I have highlighted both last year and this year, we have a small carryover effect of about $125 million that's currently capitalized in cost of goods sold that will be released that -- excuse me, currently capitalized in inventory that will be released in the cost of goods sold, primarily during the first quarter without a corresponding tax benefit. So the answer is, going forward, after that $125 million works its way through cost of goods sold, it will be roughly equivalent to move from the Puerto Rico Excise Tax or the PRET which was recorded in cost of goods sold down to the actual income tax rate. The question on guidance. And I think the question was, what's included from BeiGene and what's not. As I said earlier to Yaron's question, what won't be included now is our share of either losses or gains in BeiGene's income. So we will include, on a mark-to-market basis in our GAAP income statement, the results of BeiGene and then the movements in the security but not in our non-GAAP income statement. We will no longer record our share of losses or their income. Bob Bradway : Let me just say, Michael and to the prior question from Evan, if you need more detail on that to make sure you fully understand what we're saying in our response, just let us know, we'll get back to you. I think particularly, Evan, for your question, if you're not familiar with that mechanism that's common to us in France, happy just to provide more color for you. Again, Michael, I know a lot going on here and apologies for the disruption and don't know if you were able to follow all the slides earlier. So if you need more color, let us know, we'll call you back after the conference call. Okay. Go ahead, Arvind, to the next question. Arvind Sood : Okay. Then we have a second question from Salveen asking, could you put the upcoming TEPEZZA Phase IV data and chronic context for us? What do you need to see? How would positive data expand the opportunity for the drug? Bob Bradway : We are subject to the restrictions that we have on our ability to say anything on what's in the documents. You want to address that? David Reese : Yes. I mean, I think we're restricted, of course, by Irish takeover rules here. What we can say is that it's worth reminding everyone that the current label is broad and encompasses patients with thyroid eye disease, the -- due to autoimmune thyroiditis. This is primarily a study that will generate data in a population that we believe will help with reimbursement and with payers. And let me ask Murdo to comment on that. I would point out that mechanistically, there is no difference between chronic thyroid eye disease and the acute form of the disease. In fact, it's a semantic definition as to when the disease progresses to the chronic form but the underlying pathogenic mechanism of being driven in large part by IGF1R [ph] is intact. And therefore, based on prior data and mechanistically, we're optimistic about that study. Murdo? Murdo Gordon : Yes. Look, I think the Horizon team is doing a very good job commercializing this product and continue to help many patients within the broad current indication, as Dave mentioned. And I think additional data here could be additive to the already very promising growth of the product. Bob Bradway : Okay. Thanks, Salveen, for your question. Let's go to the next one, Arvind. Arvind Sood : The next 1 is from Christopher Schott of JPMorgan. And Christopher is saying, can you elaborate on our Otezla in 2023? Bristol suggesting that they are seeing some strong initial uptake in their bridge program and would be interested how much of this market expansion for orals versus something you're seeing in Otezla. And you mentioned an impact from competitor free drug impact over the next few quarters. Do you anticipate that will lessen as the year continues or an impact for much of the year? Murdo Gordon : Yes. It's a similar question to 1 asked earlier but perhaps I can elaborate a little bit for Chris. It's fairly clear that dermatologists want to use the easiest product and safest and well-understood product when moving to a first systemic treatment post topically. Many of these topical patients are hesitant to try a systemic agent. And so I think this is where Otezla's profile studied extensively with over 700,000 patients globally having experienced this product, the safety and efficacy of Otezla is extremely well understood. As I mentioned earlier, the frontline access coverage that we've secured in the U.S. without a lot of prior authorization requirement, the convenience of that for dermatology practices is very clear and it makes it a really good first-line treatment, systemic treatment, especially for a patient with milder or more moderate disease. For moderate or severe disease, it is likely that you're going to need to use something like a biologic or a second-line agent. And we think that given that [indiscernible] has yet to go through the market access process and secure payer reimbursement, we're not really seeing how it's actually going to be used longer term in the marketplace. And I think sometimes, these free good programs can distort what the actual uptake curve will be for a product. Arvind Sood : Then Murdo, there is a second question from Chris. He's asking, how are you thinking about ENBREL pricing dynamics over time, given the expected significant price declines in the HUMIRA market? I know you've talked about price continuing to erode but not accelerate. Can you remind us why we shouldn't expect a bigger step-down in price in 2023 or 2024 as the HUMIRA market price resets down significantly? Murdo Gordon : Well, as I mentioned before, we're primarily through our 2023 cycle and we've secured very good access. We've had to concede a bit of price, as I mentioned but not anything that looks precipitous compared to prior years. So we're pleased with that. ENBREL is an important product for many indications. We see that the safety and efficacy profile of ENBREL is well understood. I think physicians also want choice. And I think that's where PBMs are also open to having more than 1 TNF product on their formulary. And I think that's really what we've been able to secure and what we continue to think we'll be able to achieve in the future. Bob Bradway : Let's go to the next question. Arvind Sood : The next question is from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. And his question is, could you talk a little bit more about your HUMIRA biosimilar negotiations thus far? Seems like AbbVie has parity access with majority of them and the pricing is different for the first half versus the second half and there's more competition. Are your contracts similar? And how should we think about the cadence of launch as the year progresses? Murdo Gordon : Well, I can't comment on a competitor's contracts with PBMs and payers. What I can say is we've secured broad access for AMGEVITA at the 3 national PBMs. We continue to work with other customers to provide access for providers and patients alike. And we'll continue to compete effectively as we have done everywhere else in the world with this product. And outside of the U.S., we were able to establish a leadership position with AMGEVITA. And we think, given the services that we've provided and the commercial footprint we have, we're in a very good competitive position vis-\u00e0-vis other biosimilars. Bob Bradway : I know a number of you have submitted questions, so we're continuing to work through the list. Anybody who hasn't yet shot Arvind an e-mail, we're going to go through those and we've got couple of handfuls still to go. So let's, Arvind, go to the next question. Arvind Sood : Yes. The next 1 is a question by Greg Renza of RBC Capital Markets and Dave, this is for you. We were interested in hearing some color on the antibody drug conjugate strategy in light of the recent deals. How is the team approaching the space? David Reese : Yes. Thanks, Greg. What I view this is as another modality in our toolkit. We've been watching the antibody drug conjugate technology quite closely for the past several years. It's advanced, so what we feel is that we'll use ADCs on appropriate targets. I view it as an addition and an extension of our modalities. These collaborations bring together our experience on target identification and validation as well as, of course, antibody generation with some of the newer conjugation technology. So as that progresses, more to come but you should view this as additive to our armamentarium. Arvind Sood : Okay. The next question is by Tim Anderson of Wolfe Research. And his question is on AMGEVITA in the U.S. And he's asking, any commentary and your comfort with sell-side consensus for U.S. sales which seems to be around $600 million in 2023? And anything you can say about contract specifics such as whether there's price protection, if any of them go beyond 2023? Murdo Gordon : Yes, we don't give product-specific guidance. And this is a new event in the U.S. biosimilar market, given this is the first big pharmacy benefit product to go up. So we will continue to update all of you as the launch progresses. We have said we think this will be gradually slope on this launch and I'm going have to keep you apprised as we go forward. Arvind Sood : Okay. The next 1 is by Dave Risinger of SVB Securities and he has 2 questions. The first 1 is for you, Dave. Please discuss key novel drug candidate readouts to watch in 2023. And the second 1 for you, Murdo. How do you expect formulary positioning for AMGEVITA to potentially change in January of 2024 after AMGEVITA is assigned an interchangeability designation? David Reese : Yes. Thanks, David. This is a year where certainly my focus, my team's focus will be on execution, a huge amount to carry forward in the pipeline. So things that I would keep an eye on, how well are we enrolling the Phase III Olpasiran trial? How well are we enrolling the AMG 133 Phase II trial? In the general medicine portfolio, in inflammation, how are the suite of rocatinlumab trials enrolling? How are we delivering on TEZSPIRE additional indications? And then finally, in oncology, things to keep an eye on are the tarlatumab program, not only the Phase II potentially registrational trial readout in the second half of the year but also initiation of a Phase III trial in second-line disease. These are some of the top line things that I'll be paying attention to. And then there are, of course, a host of others earlier in the pipeline and in discovery research. Murdo Gordon : And just on the AMGEVITA question, I would say that we have a commitment to continuing to make sure that the product attributes of our biosimilars provide payers, providers and patients with all of the benefits that they're looking for. And we're also trying to ensure that there is no reason to switch away from AMGEVITA in the long range. So we hope that interchangeability, the high concentration and the fact that we already have a citrate-free product on the market, along with the services we provide, along with the fact that this is an Amgen team of people who understand the inflammation indications of this product very well and they have relationships with the customers that prescribe HUMIRA, we feel really good about the durability of AMGEVITA long term beyond 2024. Arvind Sood : Okay. The next question is from Umer Raffat from Evercore and he has 2 questions. The first 1 is for you, Dave, on OX40 and the monthly dosing in Phase III. He said and I don't see an arm investigating extended intervals quarterly or biannually. I'm just trying to tie the Phase III dosing interval versus the durable efficacy seen through 6 months post last dose. And the second question is for you, Peter, that the tax rate stepped up from 14% to 18% to 19%. Just wanted to get some additional color. David Reese : Yes. Regarding the dosing of rocatinlumab. As we've indicated before, we will explore different dosing paradigms here. And as that suite of Phase III trials fully launches, I think it will become clear what we're looking for there based on both the mechanism of action of the molecule as well as patient convenience. Peter? Peter Griffith : Umer, good question on tax. Again, it's just a change in what I would say the real estate on the P&L which is the PRET moves from the cost of sales line down to income tax expense in connection with the change in Puerto Rico for us from a PRET to the actual income tax in Puerto Rico which began here in 2023. So that's the nature of that change and that's where the 18% to 19% comes in from where we've been here historically. Arvind Sood : Okay. The next question is from Jay Olson of Oppenheimer. And Jay is asking, can you talk about your plans for geographic diversification? It seems like ex U.S. revenues have become a small percentage of Amgen's total revenues over the past few quarters. And we were wondering what underlying dynamics drove that shift in geographical mix and if there are any future launches or other dynamics that might push the geographical mix back in favor of ex U.S. growth. Murdo Gordon : Yes, we are actually very pleased with the expansion internationally of the Amgen footprint being in over 100 markets. We continue to launch products and secure reimbursement around the world. I talked about LUMAKRAS. And most recently in China, we've been able to secure national reimbursement drug listing for both Prolia and Repatha. Our Japanese affiliate is growing well. In the recent history, I think what you're seeing is a function of just timing of launches coming a bit earlier in the U.S. and also some of our partnering products. I think longer term, what we've got is a very interesting portfolio of products that will continue to make their way around the world. The announced Horizon acquisition has a very large opportunity internationally. And we see our JPAC region is actually our fastest-growing potential opportunity longer term. So I wouldn't look at short-term movement from quarter-to-quarter. The long-term prevailing trend is that we will grow quickly outside the United States. Arvind Sood : Okay. The next question is for you, Murdo, from Michael Schmidt of Guggenheim Partners. And he's asking, how confident are you in achieving low double-digit Otezla growth in 2023 and beyond, given the current pattern of essentially flat sales since 2020 of $2.2 billion? Murdo Gordon : Yes, I think we remain quite confident in our long-term growth of Otezla. We are in a period where there's a lot of new product entrants in the market competing for new patient starts. I think the unique positioning of the product, as I mentioned, allows us to source a very large pool of patients. And our coverage around the world and particularly in the U.S. from an insurance reimbursement perspective allows us to penetrate that market. So we feel very good about the continued prospects to grow Otezla. Arvind Sood : Okay. The next question is from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. So she's asking, big picture, your guidance implies potentially flat growth. Given biosimilar pressures and pricing pressures, do you think 2023 is a trough year? And regarding the guidance range, can you give pushes and pulls on the biosimilar range? Bob Bradway : So Robyn, maybe I'll start on the last piece and then Pete, you can reiterate what we said about '23. But as I said in my remarks, Robyn, we have 6 further similar launches planned between now and the end of the decade in the United States and other countries around the world. And it is the launch of those molecules through time which will enable us to continue to grow that franchise. So I would reiterate what I said earlier in my prepared comments. I think you've heard Murdo address as well the attractive opportunities that we think we'll have here, in particular, with AMGEVITA though we're in the first day of launch. And with respect to '23, Pete, I don't know whether you want to say anything in addition to what you already have about the outlook for the year. Peter Griffith : Thanks. I think we covered it earlier. I'd just note a couple of items that happened in 2022 that we didn't expect benefit from in '23, just to reiterate those. We don't expect any and assume any COVID-19 antibody revenues in '23. We're assuming a lower amount of Nplate sales in '23, Robyn, compared to '22. Recall, '22 had the significant purchase by the U.S. government in the second half of the year. We had several favorable changes to estimated sales deductions that occurred in '22 and we sold the generics business in Turkey which closed late in '22. So a couple of puts and takes around those. And so we look forward to a year in 2023 with strong growth in our priority products, since of, Repatha, Prolia, TAVNEOS. And also -- and that's in light of -- consistent with the industry trends we talked about in our recent history with mid-single-digit price declines in our portfolio but good volume growth. I think maybe to go back to the question Jay asked, too, we expect strong volume growth outside the United States in 2023. So we're looking forward to taking on '23 with a lot of aggressiveness. Arvind Sood : Okay. The next question is from Matt Phipps of William Blair. And Matt's saying the oncology biosimilar 2023 guidance suggests a year-over-year decline of 38% versus a 30% year-over-year decline from '21 to '22. Is the rate of erosion in the oncology biosimilars expected to continue to get larger beyond 2023 or will this eventually hit something of a floor? Murdo Gordon : I wouldn't say we expect it to get larger but we will continue to see a decline in that business which is a function of the average selling price decline that we've seen thus far. Arvind Sood : Yaron calling. He said I'm confused by the tax rate going up to 18% to 19% while COGS are 16% to 17%. Hence, I don't see any offsets in the COGS line. What am I missing? Peter Griffith : I think the answer to that is that our volume growth, the volume growth is quite large and that's really the offset, Yaron. That's a good question. And so we see that happening. We also -- in terms of the move of the PRET down there, recall, too, in cost of sales this year, we've got $125 million coming in off of the release out of inventory into cost of sales without any corresponding tax provision. And so the percent of sales versus a percent of pretax too, you've got to be thinking about that in terms of the income tax provision itself. So that's the puts and the takes on that. But when you strip it all back, it's really that move of the PRET down into the income tax expense that increases that effective rate to 18% to 19%. Arvind Sood : Okay. The next question is from [indiscernible] from Credit Suisse. Thanks for the comments on Otezla and ENBREL. So can you add a bit more color into the dynamics in immunology? Are there any changes in the channel and mix of patients? Has there been any formulary disruptions? Murdo Gordon : Overall, our immunology business looks very good. I think we're very pleased with the TEZSPIRE launch. We continue to see broad phenotypes of patients regardless of biomarker status being treated. We are seeing de novo patients who haven't seen a biologic before in their treatment of their uncontrolled asthma. And we're also seeing patients being switched from other products within the class. And so we expect that area of autoimmune disease growing in terms of the biologic penetration of severe uncontrolled asthma. And we're well positioned to compete for that expanded treatment pattern. ENBREL continues to serve many patients. And the trends there are fairly predictable and fairly consistent. Otezla, as we've mentioned, is seeing some pressure from new free drug programs, both for our topicals as well as new entrant oral And then we also have just picked up TAVNEOS which we're really excited about, a product that treats a severe autoimmune disease, ANCA-associated vasculitis, very young product, very early in its life cycle and I think a lot of growth there to be had. And then, of course, last but certainly not least, on the branded side, the announced acquisition of Horizon. So I think the inflammation area, along with our own innovative pipeline and the pipeline of Horizon is a very good growth opportunity for us long term. And last but not least, here we are on the first day of launch of a novel biosimilar to the largest product in the U.S. and that's HUMIRA. So I think we've got a lot of opportunities for growth ahead. Bob Bradway : I think we're down to our last question, Arvind, if you want to... Arvind Sood : Yes. Let me read the last question, Bob and after that, you might have some concluding comments. So the last question is from Brian Skorney of Baird and Brian wants to know, do you expect this to be more of a longer-term tax rate, assuming no major changes to corporate tax rates in the U.S.? Peter Griffith : Yes, Brian, I think, as you know, we don't give long-term guidance on tax rates. And so we won't go beyond this year, so 18% to 19%. And go back to your own just to make sure we understand the change in the PRET. The PRET is a percentage of its cost of sales as opposed to the income tax rate which is pretax income. So that's a little bit of the difference to that Yaron asked about. So 18% to 19% this year is where we're at and that's where we'll -- that's what we'll give you for now. Bob Bradway : All right. Well, thank you very much, again, for your patience. Apologies that we had a little bit of difficulty with our vendor's connection earlier on the call. So if you have any further questions, shoot them into Arvind. We'll be around here this afternoon, Peter Murdo, Dave and myself, to answer any further questions you might have. And we appreciate your joining the call and look forward to talking to you during the course of 2023. Thank you. Operator : Thanks for using Webex. Visit our website at www.webex.com.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : My name is Julianne and I'll be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's First Quarter Full Year 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speakers prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood. You may now begin. Arvind Sood : Thank you, Julianne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call to discuss our results for the first quarter of 2023. Strong unit volume growth that sets up the stage nicely for improved outlook for the balance of the year. These are some of the key themes that you're going to hear about today. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will lead the call with some prepared remarks, followed by a broader review of our performance by other members of our leadership team. You should have received a link to our slides that we have posted. Through the course of our discussion today, we'll make some forward-looking statements and use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and just a reminder that actual results can vary materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and let me thank all of you for joining our call. I'll begin by calling your attention to the 14% volume growth we delivered in the first quarter. That illustrates two points worth keeping in mind when thinking about the remainder of the year and beyond. First, on the COVID front seem to have finally turned the page on the pandemic in terms of its impact on the overall health care system. For example, we've seen year-over-year prescription growth across most specialties in the US, including cardiology and oncology, and that's good news because it suggests that patients are returning to their pre-pandemic routines with doctor visits once again enabling appropriate diagnoses and treatments. It's obviously something that bodes well for our portfolio of medicines. Second, we're seeing that the demand for medicines is resilient despite the current macroeconomic challenges. Repatha, EVENITY , BLINCYTO and KYPROLIS, for example, all delivered record sales in the quarter, driven by extremely strong growth in volumes of 33%, 55%, 49% and 18% respectively. We don't see this volume driven growth as a single quarter phenomenon either, rather we see this as the potential for these medicines and others in our portfolio to reach many more patients over time and contribute substantially to our long-term growth. Take Repatha. We believe there's tremendous upside opportunity for Repatha at a time when most high risk cardiovascular patients still never reach their recommended LDL levels or do so only for a brief insufficient period of time. The global public health crisis and heart disease demands that all players in the system work together to drive change, and with Repatha, we've proven we have a proven innovation that we know can be an essential part of the solution. Two of our newest medicines, TEZSPIRE and TAVNEOS achieved quarter-over-quarter volume growth in the US of 28% and 27% respectively. TEZSPIRE has enjoyed strong adoption in the US by both allergists and pulmonologists and recently approved, excuse me, a recently approved pre-filled pen gives patients the option for self-administration. A few quarters into our ownership of TAVNEOS, we are convinced that our deep experience in rheumatology and nephrology will enable us to bring this first-in-class medicine to many more patients who can benefit from it. Outside the US, volumes grew more than 20% in the quarter. In the Asia-Pacific region in particular, we generated nearly 50% volume growth, as we expand the number of patients we serve in Japan and China, two of the world's most rapidly ageing nations with medicines like Repatha and Prolia. Amgen's R&D investment was up 12% in the quarter. That growth reflects the investments we are making in registration enabling trials for several potential new first-in-class medicines, including Olpasiran in heart disease, Rocatinlimab in inflammation and bemarituzumab and tarlatamab in cancer. All four of these medicines are quintessentially Amgen. Innovative molecules that deliver large effect sizes against serious diseases for which new treatments are very much needed. We are pursuing a number of significant new indications for TEZSPIRE, BLINCYTO and LUMAKRAS as well. We look forward to several data readouts from our pipeline, mainly in the second half of the year. We continue to invest heavily in early research where we've built a differentiated set of capabilities over the past decade that position us well to take advantage of the rapid convergence of biology and technology that we see happening today. At a time when the world marvels at ChatGPT, we've been deploying artificial intelligence and machine learning in our research labs for some time now, giving us dry lab capabilities that, when applied to biologics development, have already yielded proof success rates and reduced cycle times beyond our initial expectations. This is indeed an exciting time for biologic innovation. We remain optimistic about our announced acquisition of Horizon and similar to our experience with TAVNEOS, the more time we've spent with the team at Horizon, the more excited we've become about the potential to bring Amgen's capabilities and global presence to bear on Horizon's portfolio of first-in-class innovative medicines and its pipeline. It's an exciting time for all of us at Amgen, and the demand for innovative medicines is proven to be resilient and growing around the world. At the same time that our ability to innovate has never been greater. Always, I'm grateful to my Amgen colleagues around the world for their commitment to patients and to our business. Now, let me turn it over to Murdo. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Bob. We kicked off 2023 with strong execution of our mission to bring innovative products to millions of patients globally. We saw record sales for ten brands in the first quarter with strong volume gains across our general medicine and hematology oncology growth brands. Our inflammation therapeutic area expanded with the US launch of AMGEVITA and the growth of TEZSPIRE and TAVNEOS and our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will soon add several important medicines to our portfolio. Volume growth in the first quarter was 14%, with 10% growth in the US and 22% growth outside the US. Asia-Pacific continues to be our fastest growing region with 47% volume growth in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange first quarter global product sales grew 4%, including the 2% negative foreign exchange impact. Product sales increased 2% year-over-year. Starting with our general medicine business, which includes Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY and Aimovig. Overall, revenue for these four products grew 13% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by 19% volume growth. Cardiovascular disease is a growing public health crisis. In the US someone has a heart attack every 40 seconds and we know LDLC is a major risk factor for heart attack or stroke. However, the state of care for high risk ASCVD patients with elevated LDL cholesterol is shockingly poor. However, we have recently released a real world analysis from the FH foundation of 38 million high risk Americans showing that fewer than 30% of them ever reached their recommended LDL levels. These statistics emphasize the importance of therapies like Repatha to address the significant medical need and we're pleased that more and more patients are now benefiting from Repatha and with volume growth of 33% in the first quarter leading to an increase in sales of 18%. Price erosion also slowed in the first quarter and declined less than prior year. In the US, volume growth of 32% was driven by broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. Outside the US, we saw 34% volume growth with strong momentum across our international business. There's clearly more work to be done to address this cardiovascular health crisis. This March at the American College of Cardiology, we convened the first ever annual LDLC Action Summit to address the state of cardiovascular care in the US by identifying strategies and delivering solutions to improve lipid management among the highest risk ASCVD patients. By intensifying the focus on lowering LDLC, a coalition of leading stakeholders in cardiovascular care have come together with Amgen to unite on a bold goal. By 2030, our ambition is to have the number of cardiovascular events in the US. We are confident that Repatha will play an important role in achieving this ambition. Transitioning to bone health. Prolia sales grew 9% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by 8% volume growth. EVENITY, which complements Prolia in our bond portfolio had record sales of $254 million for the quarter, primarily driven by strong volume growth across markets. Now to our inflammation portfolio. OTEZLA volume increased 5% in the quarter. Sales decreased 13% year-over-year, driven by lower inventory levels and price declines resulting from patient and payer mix. Additional rebates were also provided to improve the quality of coverage. Growth of our US OTEZLA business has been impacted by free drug programs for newly launched topical and systemic competitors and we expect new patient demand will continue to be impacted by these programs throughout 2023. Longer term, we see strong growth potential for OTEZLA given its established efficacy and safety profile. Strong payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and ease of administration. OTEZLA remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well positioned to help the more than 1.5 million systemic naive US patients with milder psoriasis that cannot be optimally addressed by a topical and can benefit from a systemic treatment like OTEZLA. Enbrel volumes in the US increased 1% in the quarter, supported by improved payer coverage. Several important factors to consider when reflecting on Enbrel performance in the quarter. Global sales decreased 33% year-over-year, driven by declines in net selling price, lower inventory levels compared to previous years and a 9% unfavorable impact of changes to estimated sales deductions related to prior periods. Going forward, we expect low-single digit volume growth throughout 2023 lower year-over-year declines in net selling price and a gradual recovery in inventory levels. The TEZSPIRE launch is progressing well with $96 million in sales in the first quarter, driven by strong adoption in the US by allergists and pulmonologists. TEZSPIRE's unique differentiated profile offers broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe, uncontrolled asthma without any phenotypic and biomarker limitations. During the first quarter, the US Food and Drug Administration approved TEZSPIRE for self-administration in a prefilled single use pen, which offers patients the convenient option to administer TEZSPIRE at home. This improves accessibility and provides more flexibility in treatment options for all patients in the United States. Sales of TAVNEOS were $23 million in the first quarter. US volumes grew 27% quarter-over-quarter, driven by an increase in new patients starting treatment. In the US TAVNEOS has now been prescribed to over 1700 patients, confirming our belief that Amgen's deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence allows us to bring TAVNEOS to more patients with ANCA associated vasculitis. In the first quarter, AMGEVITA launched as the first US biosimilar to HUMIRA, a medicine used by more than 1 million patients living with serious inflammatory diseases. We saw the first prescriptions to patients being fulfilled this quarter and we're encouraged by the high awareness of AMGEVITA among gastroenterologists and rheumatologists. With our track record of developing and manufacturing biologics and decades of experience in inflammation, Amgen is uniquely equipped to patients with this biosimilar medicine. Looking ahead, we expect Q2 AMGEVITA sales in the US to be lower than Q1 sales is a majority of our US AMGEVITA sales in the first quarter stemmed from inventory build. Moving to our hematology and oncology business, which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO. Sales and volume for these six innovative products grew 21% year-over-year for the quarter, with KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO achieving record quarterly sales. Growth in our hematology and oncology business was supported by important new clinical data. BLINCYTO sales grew 41% in the first quarter, supported by strong adoption across academic and community centers, following positive data from the registration enabling E1910 study presented in December of 2022. Vectibix sales increased 16% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by 15% volume growth supported by positive data from the Phase 3 paradigm trial demonstrating the superiority of Vectibix over bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy. KYPROLIS continued its strong trajectory with 25% growth in the quarter driven by 18% volume growth. LUMAKRAS reported $74 million in sales in the first quarter and a 19% increase year-over-year, driven by 40% volume growth partially offset by lower net selling price. Outside the US, LUMAKRAS has been approved in 50 countries and we're actively launching in over 30 markets and pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries. Sales of our oncology biosimilars declined 27% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by lower net selling price. While our biosimilars for MVASI and KANJINTI both hold leading shares in the US. We expect continued net selling price deterioration and accelerating volume declines driven by increased competition. Over time we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. Given the strong performance of our hematology and oncology portfolio and the recent positive data on BLINCYTO and VECTIBI as well as ongoing clinical development of LUMAKRAS and our oncology pipeline. I look forward to the future growth potential of this portfolio. As we close out this first quarter of 2023, I'm pleased with our strong execution across our portfolio both in the US and internationally. And with that, I'll turn it to Dave. David Reese : Thanks, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. For R&D, last quarter was one of high quality execution as we progressed our innovative pipeline with multiple registration enabling studies on track. In general medicine, we advanced our cardiovascular franchise in emerging portfolio of obesity molecules with a focus on clinical execution. Let's start with Olpasiran. Phase 3 outcome study in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is enrolling well. In March, we presented additional data demonstrating that Olpasiran markedly reduced Lp(a) concentration irrespective of baseline levels in individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and Lp(a) levels greater than 150 nanomoles per liter. We also initiated the African-American heart study in collaboration with the Association of Black Cardiologists and the Morehouse School of Medicine. This study will measure the association between Lp(a) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in 5000 African-American individuals. African-Americans show a higher average Lp(a) concentration than white individuals, but Lp(a) research to date has primarily been conducted in those of European descent. We are collaborating on the African-American Heart Study to bridge this gap. Turning to obesity, we are rapidly enrolling a Phase 2 study of AMG133in patients with obesity with or without diabetes and related comorbidities. The study will investigate different dosing levels and regimens with the overall goal of generating data that will provide broad optionality to design a Phase 3 program that will deliver strong, sustainable weight loss. A Phase 1 trial of AMG 786, a small molecule targeting non-incretin pathways in obesity is enrolling patients. Multiple preclinical molecules, all with different mechanisms of action than GLP-1 or GIPR based therapies are also advancing towards the clinic. In inflammation beyond severe asthma, we are investigating multiple additional indications with TEZSPIRE, including separate Phase 3 studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. We also have two Phase 2 studies, one in chronic spontaneous urticaria and the other in COPD. The CSU study is complete with top line data anticipated in mid-2023. The COPD trial is fully enrolled and has recruited a broad population of COPD patients, including patients with both high and low eosinophil counts. Emerging evidence suggests that TSLP is involved in chronic inflammatory disorders, including COPD and that TSLP may be a key driver of the severe exacerbations experienced by COPD patients. We look forward to the readout of this study in the first half of 2024. Rocatinlimab potentially first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Recruitment is off to a strong start on the ROCKET Phase 3 clinical development program. This program is a suite of seven studies that will establish safety and efficacy in a broad population of patients with atopic dermatitis, including biologic naive, biologic or JAK experienced, diverse ethnic groups and adolescents and also testing different dosing regimens, including the potential for monthly or less frequent dosing. We were encouraged to see Horizon report on the statistically significant and clinically meaningful top line results from a Phase 4 clinical trial of TEPEZZA. As revised FDA label states TEPEZZA is indicated for the treatment of thyroid eye disease regardless of clinical activity score or disease duration. Phase 2b studies in systemic lupus erythematosus of rozibafusp alfa and efavaleukin alfa were stopped for futility. These studies utilize novel adaptive designs, which enabled us to generate decision making data more quickly, and cost effectively. SLE remains a challenging area for drug development, one that will be an area of focus for us as we further explore these data sets to advance our knowledge in the field. In addition to our organic pipeline, we look forward to incorporating the Horizon molecules upon deal close to further enhance our efforts to address inflammatory disease. In oncology. global regulatory submissions are planned in the second half of 2023 for E1910, a Phase three trial led by the ECOG ACRIN Cooperative Group, demonstrating that addition of BLINCYTO to standard of care consolidation, chemotherapy significantly increased overall survival versus standard of care in MRD negative adult patients with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL. Beyond this study, we are investing to move BLINCYTO into earlier lines of treatment and to improve patient convenience through subcutaneous administration. DeLLphi-304, a Phase 3 study comparing tarlatamab, BiTE molecule targeting DLL3 with standard of care chemotherapy in second line small cell lung cancer will be initiated this month. We'll have top line data from a potentially registrational Phase 2 study of tarlatamab and heavily pretreated patients with small cell lung cancer in the second half of 2023, potential milestone for patients with small cell lung cancer. As you are aware, we are exploring novel combinations with LUMAKRAS. Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in third line colorectal cancer is fully enrolled with data readout anticipated in the second half of 2023. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS and chemotherapy in first line non-small cell lung cancer in PDL-1 negative patients. At ASCO, data will be presented from studies of LUMAKRAS in combination with standard of care, chemotherapy and non-small cell lung cancer and in combination with Vectibix and standard of care chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. We also completed submission of the LUMAKRAS code break 200 data along with data from the Phase 2 dose comparison Substudy to the US FDA and to the European Medicines Agency or EMA. For AMG 509, a steep one targeting bispecific now named Xaluritamig. We have determined target doses and open monotherapy expansion cohorts in patients with advanced prostate cancer. We look forward to sharing initial data in the second half of 2023. To add to our growing biosimilars portfolio, we are pleased to announce that the European Commission granted marketing authorization for BEKEMV our biosimilar to SOLIRIS. BEKEMV is the first biosimilar to SOLIRIS approved by the EC and is approved only for the treatment of adults and children with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or PNH, a rare life threatening bone marrow disorder. We have also submitted the US Biologics license application to the FDA for this product. Additionally, Phase 3 switching study to support an interchangeability designation in the US using an investigational high concentration formulation of AMGEVITA met its primary endpoint of similarity for the primary pharmacokinetics endpoints. In conclusion, I would like to thank Amgen staff around the world for their relentless focus on execution as we work hard to meet the needs of the patients we serve. I'll now turn things over to Peter. Peter Griffith : Thank you, Dave. We're pleased with our execution and remain on track to deliver against our full year 2023 and longer term objectives driven again by strong 14% volume growth across a number of products including Repatha, EVENITY, BLINCYTO, TEZSPIRE and TAVNEOS. While we advance our late stage pipeline and work to complete the acquisition of Horizon by the end of June. We continue to invest for long-term growth. I'll review our first quarter results before discussing our 2023 guidance. As a reminder, these results and outlook reflect Amgen on a standalone basis without any adjustments for the announced Horizon acquisition. Turning to our first quarter financial results, which are shown on slide 38 of the slide deck. Total revenue at $6.1 billion declined 2% year-over-year. However, excluding the 2% negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, product sales increased 4% and total revenues were unchanged versus the first quarter of 2022. The four percentage point difference was due to an expected decrease in other revenue due to lower profit and cost sharing from our COVID-19 collaboration with Lilly. First quarter product sales are seasonally the lowest quarter as a percentage of the full year due to benefit plan changes, insurance re-verification and increased co-pay expenses. In our first quarter, product sales increased 2% year-over-year, driven by 14% volume growth, partially offset by 5% lower net selling price, 3% unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions, 2% lower inventory levels and the 2% impact of FX rates previously mentioned. First quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 6% year-over-year, driven by investments in research and development. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the quarter increased 12% year-over-year, with higher spending and later stage program support. Discovery research and early pipeline and marketed product support. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 0.8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 17.4%, primarily due to changes in product mix and higher profit share expense. Now, recall that cost of sales in the first quarter was impacted by a portion of the $125 million of Puerto Rico excise tax. That was previously capitalized to inventory with the residual impact expected in the second quarter. Non-GAAP G&A expenses in the first quarter increased 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments, digitalization and driving productivity. Non-GAAP OI&E benefited from higher interest income and approximately 110 million of gains from deleveraging related to the repurchase of a portion of our debt portfolio. Also recall we now mark-to-market our investment in Beijing with the impact included on our GAAP income statement. In the first quarter, this resulted in a GAAP only pre-tax gain of about $1.9 billion. As expected, our first quarter non-GAAP tax rate increased 3.7 percentage points to 17.8%, primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change that replaced the excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023 as well as increased interest expense on our existing tax reserves. We are committed to our capital allocation priorities. First, we continue our investments in internal and external innovation that drive our long-term growth. Our increased spending and non-GAAP R&D of 12% in Q1 '23 over Q1 '22, coupled with our acquisition of TAVNEOS and our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will further broaden and strengthen our portfolio of first-in-class and best-in-class therapeutics to deliver to more patients globally. Second, we continue investing in our business to further long-term growth. Capital expenditures are at near peak levels, driven by simultaneous construction of our state of the art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. We expect our annual capital expenditures to decline starting in 2024 with the completion and licensing of our Ohio plant. And third, we continue to return capital to our shareholders as we pay dividends of $2.13 per share in the first quarter. This represented a 10% increase over that paid in each of 2022 four quarters. Free cash flow for the quarter was driven lower by the timing of sales rebates and incentives, lower operating income and higher capital expenditures from the building out of the state-of-the-art facilities in North Carolina and Ohio. We expect strong cash flow for the remainder of the year consistent with our full year 2023 financial outlook that includes a non-GAAP operating margin of roughly 50%. We expect sequential growth in our free cash flow in the second quarter, although there may be an impact to Q2 and free cash flow from the expected closing of the Horizon acquisition due to the accounting treatment of certain items that were all expected in our Horizon acquisition financing and estimated deal costs as well as our previously announced restructuring in the first quarter. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2023 on slide 40. Our guidance is currently provided on the Amgen standalone business and does not include any Horizon projections. We are raising our 2023 guidance. We're raising our 2023 revenue guidance to $26.2 billion to $27.3 billion versus previous guidance of $26.0 billion to $27.2 billion. This reflects our confidence in the underlying business and the improving overall market conditions for our patients to access our medicines that Bob and Murdo mentioned. We are also raising our 2023 non-GAAP EPS guidance to $17.60 to $18.70 versus previous guidance of $17.40 per share to $18.60 per share. Let me mention a few more important considerations as you model the remainder of '23. For product sales, we project solid volume growth at a portfolio level and consistent with the first quarter. We expect a mid-single digit price decline for our portfolio in 2023. We now project full year Neulasta sales of approximately $700 million and full year combined KANJINT and MVASI sales of approximately 850 million. We anticipate full year non-GAAP operating expenses to increase by about 1% over last year. We expect the 2023 operating margin as a percent of product sales to be roughly 50% and expect our second quarter operating margin to also be roughly 50%. And we also expect cost of sales as a percentage of product sales to be between 16% and 17%. Non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2023 to remain unchanged and estimated to increase 3% to 4% year over year. Non-GAAP spend is a percentage of product sales to slightly decrease year-over-year, driven by our ongoing digitalization, continuous improvement and productivity imperatives. We anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be in the range of 1.2 billion to 1.3 billion, reflecting the first quarter deleveraging related to the debt repurchases I mentioned. With the remainder of the year's R&D expense to be evenly split over the remaining three quarters. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 18% to 19%. We plan to continue to meaningfully increase our dividend. We continue to expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2023. Our capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at approximately 925 million in 2023. Our confidence is strong and the long-term outlook for Amgen and our long-term growth. We look forward to completing the announced acquisition of Horizon. We expect to provide updated guidance as appropriate after the transaction closes. Many thanks as always to our 24,000 plus dedicated colleagues all over the world executing each day on behalf of our patients and our future patients. That concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Bob for Q&A. Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Peter. All right, Julianne, if you could remind our callers of the process for asking a question. I know they've had a long day already, so ask them to hold their questions to one each and do our best to get to everybody who has one for us. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Salveen Richter : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. For TEZSPIRE you've highlighted the broad clinical program and given the Phase 2 data sets we're expecting this year and next year, could you just comment on the indications where you have the most confidence in. Thank you. Bob Bradway : Reese, over to you. David Reese : Yeah, thanks, Salveen. All of the indications that we're pursuing have some mechanistic basis. Chronic spontaneous urticarial is an eosinophilic driven disease in part as is eosinophilic esophagitis. And given the mechanism of T-cell inhibition that underlay the thinking behind pursuing those indications. As I've mentioned briefly in COPD as another example, the -- there is accumulating evidence that triggers such as viral infection, smoke particles from pollutants can trigger TSLP release from bronchial epithelium. These are consistent with data showing that in patients with COPD, TSLP levels are elevated in sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and bronchial mucosa. And so as I mentioned that trial is fully enrolled. We expect a data readout, given the duration of therapy that one wants to see in these patients in the first half of next year. So I think there's good mechanistic basis. We're in clinical trial execution mode now and really waiting data readouts. Operator : Thank you, Salveen. Our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Yee : Thank you. Following on the pipeline maybe for David. I think what's interesting is that you obviously had AMG 133 obesity data and now you are emphasizing AMG 786. And I think it's enrolling in treating people now. Can you just talk a little bit about why you'd be excited about that? Is that synergistic? Is there an angle with that to be excited about, given all of the things going on in obesity? Thank you. David Reese : I think what you said at the end there is very important, Mike, you know, in terms of everything that's going on in obesity. If we just step back for a second and think about what the magnitude of the problem is here, you know, there are hundreds of millions of patients now globally. We are doing an experiment in the 21st century that the world has never done by creating an obesity crisis. Now we call obesity a single disease, but it is clearly a complex, heterogeneous disorder. There are undoubtedly patient subsets buried within that. And different patients may well, you know, benefit from different therapies. This is an disorder that's rooted in human evolution and now is a function of our environment. And so our development program for both 133 and for the molecules that will follow behind really intends to capitalize on the fact that there's a very large volume of patients. It's a heterogeneous disorder. I think this is a field that is in its infancy and we have a chance to help define what those patient subsets are and who will benefit from specific therapies using, for example, you know, our industry leading database of multi-omic profiling, which we, you know, intend to employ aggressively in these development programs. You mentioned AMG 786, and I'll just conclude with a comment on that. That is a non-incretin based mechanism of action. And I think that is also an area that will be very fertile for drug development and it's a focus of us pre-clinically as well right now. So thanks for the question. It's early days, but we think that this is one of the big public health challenges of the current century. Operator : Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'm a little confused today about some of the numbers I'm looking at. So, for example, I mean, you know, well, Abbvie's Humira went biosimilar. You guys are the ones that launched it and AbbVie reported they're down 26% year-over-year. So I guess what I don't understand is how come Enbrel is down 33% year-over-year, more so than the company that did go biosimilar. And I think some of that speaks to a little bit of the inventory issues that are happening. And they seem quite significant. The more I think about the magnitude reported, for example, 21% drop on Enbrel and 28% drop on OTEZLA, which almost sounds like three weeks' worth of work down. I usually think of total inventory in the channel being about three weeks, so we'd love to get any clarity there. Thank you. Murdo Gordon : Yeah, thanks, Umer. You're on to some of the fact pattern. Let me just go through kind of the elements of Enbrel specifically. First off, we were up 1% in volume in the quarter. So the leading indicators of Enbrel volume performance all look quite good. And that's a function of strong demand for the product in the market, good quality execution and an additional pharmacy benefit formulary win starting in January of the year. So we would expect continued low-single digit volume growth throughout the course of 2023. So that's the kind of high quality leading indicators of the volume performance of the product. The inventory component is pretty substantial. As you highlight, it is a function of both wholesaler inventory levels being down as well as specialty pharmacy. And I think it's partly a function of the fact that we did have volume increase and there was also a pretty significant work down through the quarter. We would expect those inventory levels to return to normal inventory levels throughout the course of the year. And then the last piece of Enbrel is an out-of-period adjustment, an unfavorable adjustment of about 9% related to prior period. And that's a function of things like state Medicaid, true ups coming in, as well as some other price adjustments from prior period. So overall, again, the leading indicators for Enbrel are good, low-single digit volume anticipated for the year, a little bit of price concession to get that formulary win. But then the other two events in the quarter are likely to improve over the course of the year as well being inventory and prior period adjustment. Peter Griffith : Maybe, Murdo, just to jump in quickly that prior period adjustment, I mean, that's an estimated sales tax sales deduction adjustment. Murdo Gordon : Thank you, Peter. Peter Griffith : So just to clarify that and as Murdo said, we're looking for a slowing year-over-year price erosion on that too. So we think we've got some trends in our favor here. Murdo Gordon : Yeah, there is a big piece of that prior period that's also PHS and given the program that we're running for PHS patients. We expect that to be a lower impact throughout the course of the year as well. Operator : Thank you, Umer. Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Raymond : Hey, thanks. I have a question on the biosimilar business. I'm not sure I heard this correctly or not, but from Murdo's comments, it sounds like Amgevita revenue might be fairly frontloaded given the inventory build that I think you guys described. I know you guys don't give quarterly granularity. But maybe talk about the outlook for the rest of the year, especially given that you have a bunch of other launches, other biosimilar launches happening in that specific space. And then maybe just more strategically, just given the expectations have been kind of tempered here with Amgevita, you guys still seem pretty committed to this business with SOLIRIS, EYLEA, STELARA launches. Just maybe talk about why these won't maybe see a similar tempering of expectations. Thanks. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. On Amgevita specifically, a lot of that Q1 revenue was what we would call buy-in from primarily IDNs. And so it's hard for us to see how much of that buy-in has been used up in actual prescription fill. So our conservative estimate is that the majority of that is buy-in and that Q2 could be lower than Q1 revenues based on that. So that's our estimate for Amgevita. Obviously, we're very early in the launch here. We're building demand physician by physician and patient by patient. And some of that IDN pull-through is not visible to us because they don't share data necessarily with the IQVIAs of the world. So that's Amgevita. But overall, we have been extremely successful in developing biosimilars at Amgen. We are very pleased with what we've been able to do so far by developing successful molecules that are either first or first wave launches. We continue to plan on being first or first wave in the biosimilar products that we're targeting. We have been able to continuously supply, thanks to the hard work of our manufacturing and supply chain colleagues around the world. When we approach both institutional customers, payers and providers, I think there's a lot of trust in the Amgen brand when it comes to the biosimilars that we manufacture. Certainly, last but not least, we do feel strongly that we will continue to be able to deliver on our 2x '21 sales by the end of the decade in our biosimilars business, so more than double our 2021 revenues. And we think we'll do that by continuing to launch both pharmacy benefit and medical benefit biosimilars, but the majority of that growth is going to be driven by medical benefit biosimilars. So still a very important part of our business, and the people that work on it continue to deliver value to the health care system as we move forward. Bob Bradway : The only thing I'd add to that, Chris, is that we're running this business very efficiently, and we think when we look at the cash that we're generating on this business, we're earning an attractive return for our shareholders. So again, in order for us to continue to succeed in biosimilars, we need to execute effectively. And as you can see in the quarter with BEKEMV the progress and with the launch of Amgevita, we continue to do what we plan to do in biosimilars. And again, I would reiterate, we think we're earning an attractive return for our shareholders, some of those commitments. Operator : Thank you, Chris. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. And my question is also related to biosimilar. Given that the demand so far doesn't look to be ticking up for Humira, and your comments about next quarter do not also suggest that it may be a slow launch here, do you think this would mean that you are losing the first mover advantage here? Or is there a way next year it could be more -- Amgevita could be more on a preferred side of formally rather than parity? Because it seems like parity is not cutting it just yet. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks for the question, Mohit. I think we've definitely taken advantage of the first mover, particularly with the IDN channel. That's really where a lot of the initial uptake will be. I think we're also differentiated versus the other biosimilar manufacturers that have biosimilars to Humira in that we do cover the customer base here quite effectively both in rheumatology and gastroenterology having deployed medical and sales teams that are out there right now building awareness and demand for Amgevita. Lastly, I would say that given that we've got parity access across the large three PBMs, we are in very good position to be able to pull through a lot of that Amgevita. I think we were clear in saying this would be a gradual uptake for this product. And we think that we still have been able to use the time that we have ahead of competition wisely to build that demand. Operator : Thank you, Mohit. Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jay Olson : Thanks for taking questions. Curious about OTEZLA and how you expect -- pricing dynamics to evolve over the course of the year, especially in the context of sort of TYK2 mostly 3 drugs right now. And how do you expect the pricing for OTEZLA to evolve following the transition to TYK2 paid customers? Thank you. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thank you, Jay. I think what we're pleased with is the broad access coverage we have on Otezla, we have very good coverage. We did actually add additional coverage at the beginning of the year with United Optum Part D plan coming online. And so there's a little bit of price concession to do that in the year. But beyond that, we've got good stable access for 2023, and we look forward to being able to maintain that in 2024. So I don't see more decrement on price. In fact, we think price will -- the negative price effects you saw in Q1 should abate a little bit in Q2 and beyond. So overall very stable. The one thing that you mentioned that's interesting is the free goods program that competitors have out there. I do think that, that's a little bit of a disruption in the market right now that's probably causing a bit of softness in our new patient demand. We get about 80% of our new patient growth coming from systemic naive topical patients receiving OTEZLA as their first systemic agent. I think when you have free good programs in the market, sometimes that free goods is a very easy way for a prescriber to try a novel agent. And I think that, that's taking away some of that new patient growth that we're used to seeing. I do think that will be different once those competitors contract for their market access, and that's likely to be a 24% impact. Operator : Thank you, Jay. Our next question comes from Colin Bristow from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Colin Bristow : Hey, good afternoon, and congrats on the quarter. So one for Murdo. We've now got the chronic TEPEZZA data. I just wondered, could you give us your thoughts on the -- and does this in any way change your view on the size of the commercial opportunity? And then a quick kind of housekeeping one on LUMAKRAS. How much of the weakness this quarter was sort of net pricing versus competition from Mirati? Thank you. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Colin. Maybe I could take a minute just on TEPEZZA because there are quite a few analysts on the call that would be unfamiliar with how the patient journey for thyroid eye disease actually works. And it's important because it has a bearing on the demand pattern for TEPEZZA. The way in which the Horizon team actually track the performance as they look at something called patient enrollment forms, which is the initial request, if you will, to start a thyroid eye disease patient on TEPEZZA. It then takes quite a while for that patient enrollment form to move its way through the prior authorization process against medical policies that payers have in place. That can take up to 90 days. Then you need to schedule that patient's first infusion. And in thyroid eye disease, it's not like in oncology where there's a clinical oncologist relatively evenly distributed throughout the country that can do infused drug administration. This is a lot more concentrated. And so it takes a while for the patient to be referred to the right site of care to receive their first infusion of TEPEZZA. So that also adds time. So while tracking the early leading indicator that we look at, which is patient enrollment form, there's quite a lag between that patient enrollment form starting and when that first infusion will occur. And that's really important to keep in mind when you see either flat or, in this case, I think strengthening demand for TEPEZZA in patient enrollment forms. That will take a while to flow through into net sales. So that would be my prefacing comment. Now besides that, I think we're really excited, as Dave said, about the chronic data that were recently announced. And my congratulations to the entire Horizon team for executing a high-quality trial and showing how TEPEZZA can benefit a broader cross-section of patients with lower clinical activity score and truly highlighting the need for chronic care in this category. So I think that's a fantastic accomplishment. I think the simultaneous label change is just a nod to the conviction that even the regulator has about the utility of this product and this disease. And then I think the Horizon team has spent a lot of time over the last few months expanding their commercial capabilities and their medical capabilities. And they're in really good shape to take this great new data, which is on label to providers and to payers and to help expand the use of that product in the U.S. So we're quite optimistic about the future growth of TEPEZZA. And then, of course, from our side, we're also excited about being able to launch TEPEZZA in other markets around the world once we close this transaction. We have the capabilities and the structure and the scale given that we've been expanding Amgen's footprint globally over the last several years. And so we're ready to go. And we'll work closely with Horizon to do that so that TEPEZZA has multiple opportunities to grow over time. On LUMAKRAS, just real quick. We did see a little bit of increased inventory in the fourth quarter of last year. So the year-on-year compare or quarter-on-quarter compare, I should say, is really more about that inventory coming through. The actual demand is pretty flat from Q4 to Q1. And so we've been able to hold on quite nicely despite competitors in the market. Operator : Thank you, Colin. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. Please go ahead . Your line is open. Brendan Smith : Hey, guys. This is Brendan on for Yaron. Thanks very much for taking the question. Just another quick one, follow-up on TEZSPIRE. Maybe specifically in CSU. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of where you maybe see the bar for this midyear readout here? Our understanding is that the mast cells are really one of the key players in CSU? And if TSLP is maybe a bit of a broader target, how do you see its impact in the disease course? Just trying to kind of understand relative positioning here and maybe gauge expectations for the Phase 2 data. Thanks very much. David Reese : Yes. Thanks. Look, the trial is fully enrolled. We're bringing in data. I think within a few months, we're going to have the data set in hand. I think I've outlined mechanistically why TSLP being upstream could be one of the triggers that, if inhibited, could serve to -- as a therapy for the disease. At this point, I think it's really just getting the data set. Operator : Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you so much or taking my questions. On OTEZLA, we've noted over several quarters, we know the demand kind of issues that are playing out. Anything you can do from a commercial perspective that could help accelerate growth even in light of the free drug programs we're seeing? Or do we really have to wait until that kind of tapers off come next year to maybe see some more growth from the brand? Thank you. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks, Evan. We're obviously doing quite a bit in the market from a commercial perspective. We've actually increased the breadth of our promotion to include much more primary care targets given that the milder patient who's on topical therapy today, that 1.5 million patient pool, it's a large addressable pool of patients, are currently under the care of primary care physicians and tend not to be referred as frequently to dermatologists as the moderate to severe patients. So we've increased our primary care footprint and we're actually seeing growth in our primary care targets. Where we're seeing a little bit of pressure or a little bit of quarter-on-quarter pressure is in the higher-end dermatology practices that treat more complex patients. And that's kind of where you would expect to see some of the novel agents being tried. So I do think that will stabilize over time, but that's going to take most of the year to take place. We'll continue to expand our primary care presence, and we're also working to expand our direct-to-consumer efforts to a mild to moderate patient population that might be on a topical, but still seeing unresolved symptoms due to their psoriasis, whether it be hands, face, scalp or other areas where the patient really wants to resolve those symptoms. So overall, there's quite a bit that we're putting into the market to increase our growth in that bio-naive or systemic-naive milder patient. And we would expect that, that will strengthen our new patient capture over the course of the year, and we expect to see good growth FOR OTEZLA for many years to come. Operator : Thank you, Evan Our next question comes from Robin Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Please go ahead . Your line is open. Nicole Germino : Thanks for taking our question. This is Nicole on for Robin. Can you help us think through the -- franchise and how Amgen plans on maintaining share given that there's a competitor or there are competitors with biosimilars with auto injector devices and other devices in the market? How much pressure should we see going forward? How should we think about the Neulasta franchise? Murdo Gordon : Thank you, Nicole, for the question. Look, we're really pleased with what we've been able to do with the Neulasta franchise to date. We've been able to defend our volume successfully. Obviously, we've had to concede some price to do that. And the volume on the prefilled syringe side has been under some pressure. I'm very pleased with what we've done with the Neulasta Onpro device, and we've held on to substantial share there. We think we've established good contractual commitments for this year. And we'll continue to battle with competitors if they come to market with a different device than is currently available. But we expect some continued pricing pressure there, as we've indicated. And overall, I think the team that's working on Neulasta has done very well. Operator : Thank you, Nicole. Our next question comes from Gregory Renza from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Gregory Renza : Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. At the top of the call, you spoke about your R&D and identified, I think, it was four medicines that you described as quintessentially Amgen. And just my question is for you and the team. As you look across your portfolio, but also externally in other areas, are there specific areas of opportunity that you think could benefit from the Amgen capabilities that perhaps are not represented or underrepresented in your portfolio today? Thanks so much. Bob Bradway : David and I can tackle that together. I think we've been very clear about what we look for in the outside, which are molecules that fit in our areas of strategic interest or where we think we have strength. And in particular, we're looking for opportunities in inflammation and in oncology and in general medicine. And we look for medicines that could be first-in-class, best-in-class and have a big effect size in the patient populations that, again, where we think we can add value. So we're constantly looking. I don't think we feel like we're particularly exposed or we need to emphasize business development in any one of those three particular areas, but we're always looking for attractive opportunities early and late. Dave? David Reese : Yes. And I would add, the other component is technology platforms. Bob mentioned briefly in his opening remarks the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I think we've quietly become a leader in this area. We are using artificial intelligence and machine learning across the R&D spectrum now from molecular engineering, where we've been extraordinarily pleased with -- it's the effect of dry labs or in silico design on the engineering of new protein molecules in time frames that are much, much shorter than were previously achievable with a higher success rate, success here being defined as a candidate going forward that has the molecular attributes that you want. We are using it extensively in the clinical trials arena for site selection, for example, and other aspects of trial design. So this is something that I'll talk about more as we go through the course of the year. But these sorts of technology platforms lead us to what I think is an absolute hinge moment in this industry where the union of tech and biotech will move us forward to a qualitatively different time in drug discovery and drug development. And I think we're going to be very well positioned to take advantage of this union. Operator : Thank you, Gregory. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tim Anderson : Thank you very much. On OTEZLA, I'm wondering if you have any market share or performance metrics in the mild psoriasis segment, specifically, where you've had approval for coming up on 1.5 years. I'm guessing you have some idea of the penetration you're making in that very different segment. Murdo Gordon : Yes, Tim, thanks for the question. Unfortunately, the differentiation between mild and moderate is difficult because there isn't really good coding that we can use as a surrogate for determining which is which. So what we look at is what percentage of our business is being sourced from systemic-naive patients, which we infer that they are milder and that their last treatment that they've been on prior to OTEZLA was a topical. And 80% of our new patient growth right now is coming from the post-topical pre-systemic patient type. So we are definitely making progress. What we're doing right now, as I mentioned earlier, is we're scaling our promotional effort that targets where these patients are being treated and we expect to be able to grow the volume of patients that we're securing. As you'll note, we grew the volume of OTEZLA in the quarter by 5%, and we expect to be able to improve on that. Bob Bradway : Julianne, I know we're already at half past the hour. So that's the time that we had asked our colleagues to set aside for the call. But we have a couple of more questions in the queue. We'll try to get through those and then as is our custom be available if anybody has any questions for later this evening. But let's go to the next question. Operator : Certainly. Thank you, Tim. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoffrey Meacham : Great. Afternoon guys. Thanks for eth queation Murdo, of your new launched products in the past few years, EVENITY stands out as one that had a really good progression each quarter. What does the long-term opportunity here look like? And then how do you think about life cycle management of the bone franchise overall later on as you get close to the LOE? Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks, Geoff, for the question, for noting the performance of EVENITY. The bone team have done an exceptional job with this product. And I think the Amgen legacy in building the Prolia franchise is clearly helping that, along with our partnership with UCB. I was just recently in Japan. And as Bob mentioned in his opening remarks, we have an ultra-aging society there. And EVENITY is doing extremely well and I would say is a really good leading indicator of what we could do in the U.S. with that product. So I think we're really early in our ability to penetrate the millions of patients that would benefit from a bone builder like EVENITY. We also see a very nice continuum of care for these patients where, let's say, you're on a busphosphanate or Prolia and you have a fracture, you go on EVENITY for 12 months, and then you return to a product like denosumab or Prolia for your continued care, so there really is a nice franchise opportunity here with both Prolia and EVENITY. And we see the addressable population as being extremely large, and we are still very early in growing that product, obviously now annualizing at over $1 billion. It's an exciting growth opportunity for us going forward. And we're as enthusiastic as we possibly could be. Arvind Sood : Julianne, take -- let's take one last question, after which Bob will make some closing comments. Operator : Our next question comes from Dane Leone from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line open. Dane Leone : As we contemplate the updated guidance for the year, probably - two competitive questions are still unclear to me on the call. Firstly, you've had a great momentum with Repatha. Earlier in the week, Novartis really highlighted Leqvio or inclisiran, finally gaining some traction in the U.S. Love to hear your thoughts around how you view competitive dynamics in the PCSK9 class for the remainder of the year. And then secondly, kind of on a similar note, I did notice LUMAKRAS declined Q-on-Q in the first quarter in the U.S. And was just curious if you saw any impact of KRAZATI the competitive agent from Mirati. Thank you. Murdo Gordon : Yes, thanks. Maybe I'll flip the answer around -- it's really too early to tell with Mirati impact. I think what I've mentioned in response to an earlier question, the actual land volume Q-on-Q is pretty flat. What we're actually seeing in the sales is a workdown of some inventory -- end-user inventory from Q4 to Q1 of this year for LUMAKRAS, but actual patients treated, pretty flat quarter-on-quarter. So we're not seeing a big impact yet from Mirati. And of course, for LUMAKRAS, we're really focused on growing LUMAKRAS through additional indications and additional data to move into earlier lines of therapy, which Dave covered in his remarks. As we look at Repatha, I think we really are excited about what we're seeing now. We see more and more enthusiasm from cardiologists in a broad way and in a deep way, i.e., using Repatha more frequently in their prescribing practices for ASCVD patients. What we've been doing over the course of the last, call it, 18 months, is increasing our Repatha commercial presence at primary care. And this year, we're actually making another step change in primary care promotional effort by increasing the size of our primary care sales force here. So Repatha is very much moving in the right direction. Patients are benefiting from it. We maintain more than a 70% share of the PCSK9 class. But quite frankly, that's not what my team looks at. They look at trying to penetrate the millions of ASCVD patients, the tens of millions of ASCVD patients that need to lower their LDLC goal. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, less than 30% of patients, and that's not our data, that's data from the family heart organization less than 30% of patients are at their LDLC goal. So we feel like this is important work. We feel like we've got a best-in-class medicine in Repatha. We've got great coverage, and we expect to continue to grow this product globally to serve many millions of patients over the years to come. Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Murdo, for your response to that question. And let me again thank all of you for joining us on the call. Just a couple of quick thoughts. Obviously, we're off to a good start here in the year, as you can see from the results in the first quarter and as I said in my opening remarks, far more important than the quarter itself is the way it's setting us up for the long term. So if you think back to the things that we've talked about as being important for us, being able to deliver on our long-term growth strategy, it starts with our growth products having to perform. As you saw in the quarter, we had 10 brands achieving record performance. And performance means growing share, growing penetration. And as Murdo said, that's what we see happening now with our important growth driving brand. The other thing we said is that for us to be successful over the long term, we've got to perform in the international markets. And again, I think the volume trends that you see here early in the year are really good in the year. We're building the kinds of platforms we need to have in order to deliver long-term growth for our medicines outside the United States. We talked a lot about biosimilars on this call. We've said that, that we think is an important contributor to our growth long term as we bring new products to market and launch them in new countries. And in order for us to do that, we need to be a leading competitor, and that means we need to execute on time and be in the first wave of launches. Once again, this quarter, you see further proof points of our being able to do that consistently with the launch of Amgevita, the approval of BEKEMV et cetera. So we think competitively, we're well positioned there and a biosimilar business to capitalize on the opportunities. And then, of course, the pipeline is always critical, and we're excited about how our pipeline is very rapidly advancing, particularly on the registration-enabling trials, whether you look at tarlatimab or bema or rocatinlimab. We have a lot of important registration-enabling work underway, and we're excited to start generating results from those portfolios -- or that portfolio of products as well as some of the products that are now attracting quite a bit of attention like 133 in our mid-stage pipeline. So all-in-all, we're off to a good start in the quarter, and we remain very enthusiastic about the long term. And in the meanwhile, we're looking forward to having an opportunity to close on the Horizon transaction once regulators have completed their work. So thank you for tuning in and we look forward to being back with all of you in August. Arvind Sood : Great. Thanks, everybody, and we'll be around for a while. So feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. Thanks again. Operator : This concludes our First Quarter Full Year 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : My name is Julianne and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today for Amgen\u2019s Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speakers prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood. You may now begin. Arvind Sood : Thank you, Julianne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call to discuss our results for the second quarter. We continued down the path of strong unit volume growth during the quarter that led to an improved outlook for the rest of the year. This also sets the stage for growth longer term augmented by some meaningful pipeline updates, particularly with an oncology development. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will lead the call with some prepared remarks, followed by a broader review of our performance by other members of our leadership team. You should have received a link to our slides that we have posted. Through the course of our discussion, we\u2019ll make some forward-looking statements and use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance. And just a reminder that actual results can vary materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you for joining our call. It was an excellent quarter across the board for Amgen and one that demonstrates why we remain very confident about our ability to deliver attractive long-term growth in sales and earnings. We delivered $7 billion in quarterly revenue, up 6% from a year ago, along with record non-GAAP earnings per share of $5 a share, up 8% over the prior year. Volume growth globally was 11% in the quarter, and that reflects all three of our therapeutic areas and all three of our geographic regions contributing to performance. For example, volume in our general medicine business grew by 21% in the quarter, while volume in our Asia Pacific region, which we have previously identified as a key source of growth for us, was up 46%. At a time of product shortages in the industry, our world-class manufacturing capabilities have enabled us to meet growing demand for our products and continue our longstanding tradition of serving every patient every time. Nine of our medicines generated record sales in the quarter. This is consistent with my comments from our first quarter call in April when I said we see the potential for many of our currently marketed products to reach significantly more patients over time and to contribute substantially to our long-term growth. In April, I spoke about Repatha and the growing contribution it\u2019s making in the fight against cardiovascular disease. Today I\u2019ll highlight Prolia, which achieved $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time, up 11%. Prolia is one of the first biologics to be widely prescribed by primary care physicians to treat a chronic disease, something we expect to see replicated over time in other categories like cardiovascular disease. For all of Prolia success though we know that osteoporosis remains an underdiagnosed and undertreated disease placing millions of elderly women at risk for life-changing fractures. With recently generated real world data, we\u2019ve established that Prolia is superior to alendronate, the most frequently prescribed bisphosphonate treatment in the U.S. in reducing fractures, and not by a little, but by a lot. To give you one data point, in May we announced that in a real world study, Prolia reduced the risk of hip fracture by 36% compared to alendronate. That\u2019s superior. Prolia and EVENITY, which achieved 47% sales growth in the quarter give us a powerful one two punch against osteoporosis, a disease that will only become more prevalent as the world grows older. You\u2019ll hear more from Murdo shortly about our very strong commercial performance through the first half of 2023. We\u2019re seeing strong momentum in our pipeline too, as you\u2019ll hear in detail from Dave Reese, we\u2019re sharing positive data today for our BiTE, tarlatamab in small cell lung cancer and for LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in colorectal cancer. We are especially excited about the tarlatamab readout, not only because of what it may mean for patients whose prognosis is otherwise exceptionally poor, but also because it adds to our growing conviction that bispecific T-cell engagers are an effective way to treat solid tumors as well as liquid tumors as we have demonstrated with BLINCYTO. Elsewhere in our pipeline, we continue to advance registration enabling trials for several potential new first-in-class medicines including Olpasiran in heart disease, rocatinlimab in atopic dermatitis, and of course bemarituzumab in gastric cancer. We look forward to additional readouts from our pipeline in the second half of the year. Turning to our planned acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, we remain very enthusiastic about what our companies can achieve together for patients suffering from rare serious diseases. Horizon has certainly accomplished a great deal as an independent company. Amgen\u2019s global commercial manufacturing and R&D capabilities, especially for biologic products, will enable Horizon\u2019s medicines to reach even more patients more quickly than Horizon could have achieved on its own. As you know, this combination has been approved by regulators around the world, with the exception of the Federal Trade Commission in the United States. The FTC\u2019s arguments in this case are based on speculation and hypothetical notions. Their arguments are not grounded in long established antitrust law. Notwithstanding that in choosing to pursue this case, they\u2019ve ignored the commitments we made to address their stated concerns. Life-changing medicines that Amgen and Horizon offer treat different diseases and different patient populations. Simply put, there are no competitive overlaps and no incentives to bundle our drugs with theirs. We look forward to making our case in court in September and I\u2019m confident rather that we will prevail. In the meantime, we\u2019re working closely on integration plans with Horizon, so we can hit the ground running by mid-December, which is when we anticipate being able to close the deal. And let me just reiterate one more point before I hand over to Murdo. As the second quarter illustrates, Amgen\u2019s business is performing very well and our organic outlook for growth is strong, adding Horizon will serve to enhance our growth prospects even further. And let me close by thanking my Amgen colleagues around the world for their unwavering commitment to patients and to our business. We\u2019re excited about the future and our ability to serve many, many more patients than we do today. Murdo? Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Bob. I am very pleased with our performance in the second quarter, fueled by a commitment to deliver on our mission to bring innovative products to millions of patients globally. Execution is strong across the business with record quarterly sales for nine brands and robust volume growth across our general medicine, inflammation and hematology-oncology portfolios. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, second quarter global product sales grew 8% year-over-year. Including the impact of foreign exchange product sales increased 6% year-over-year. Volume growth was 11% with strength across our regions. U.S. volume growth was 9%. And volume growth in our Europe, Latin America, Middle East and Canada region was 8%. And consistent with our international expansion strategy, Asia-Pacific continues to be our fastest growing region with 46% volume growth in the quarter. Starting with our general medicines business, which includes Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY, Aimovig. Overall revenue for these four products grew 19% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by 21% volume growth. Cardiovascular disease is a growing public health crisis and the state of care for high risk ASCVD patients with elevated LDL cholesterol is poor. Family heart, real world analysis of 38 million high risk Americans revealed that fewer than 30% of them ever reached their recommended LDL levels. This is a clear call to action that lowering LDL cholesterol as much and as early as possible with Repatha will reduce cardiovascular risk for patients. And so to meet this need, I\u2019m Amgen is committed to improving patient\u2019s ease of access and affordability. Today we have best-in-class formulary coverage for Repatha helping 90% of eligible U.S. patients gain access to this important medicine. Improved access is enabling broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. So, this has set the stage for growth for Repatha sales, which increased 30% year-over-year to a record $424 million in the second quarter. In the U.S. volume growth of 34% was driven by a record number of new patients starting treatment. Outside the U.S. we saw 37% volume growth with momentum across our regions. We recognize there are still many more patients around the world who can benefit from Repatha. And to meet that challenge, we are increasing investment to intensify our engagement with healthcare providers, bring our message directly to patients through direct-to-consumer media and drive urgency around LDLC testing and adherence to treatment guidelines. Transitioning to bone health, Prolia sales grew 11% year-over-year to a record $1 billion in second quarter driven by 11% volume growth. As Dave will discuss in more detail new real-world evidence data presented at the World Congress on Osteoporosis in May demonstrates the Prolia significantly reduces fracture risk across multiple endpoints when compared to alendronate. Our sales teams are now equipped with these data and are actively helping physicians understand the superior ability of Prolia to reduce the risk of fracture for their osteoporosis patients. EVENITY, which compliments Prolia in our bone portfolio, had record sales of $281 million for the quarter driven by strong volume growth across markets. In Japan, EVENITY had achieved a 42% share of the growing bone builder market, steadily increasing performance versus competitors and increasing initiation for na\u00efve patients. EVENITY sales are now annualizing at over $1 billion. Given the severe impact of fractures on the lives of women who are post-menopausal our success in Japan, the first launch market for EVENITY enhances our confidence in the significant growth potential through this decade. Otezla sales increased 1% year-over-year driven by 2% volume growth. Otezla remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well-positioned to help the more than 1.5 million systemic na\u00efve U.S. patients with milder psoriasis that cannot be optimally addressed by a topical treatment and can benefit from a systemic drug like Otezla. Our U.S. Otezla business has been impacted by free drug programs for newly launched topical and systemic competitors. And we expect new patient demand will continue to be affected by these programs for the remainder of 2023. Despite this, we see a compelling opportunity to invest in growth of Otezla and to drive increased awareness amongst physicians and patients. We are confident in the growth potential of Otezla given its unique combination of established efficacy and safety profile, broad payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and a lack of testing required for initiation, and of course, ease of administration. Enbrel sales grew 84% quarter-over-quarter following the seasonal impact on price and large drawdown of inventory during the first quarter in the U.S. Year-over-year, Enbrel sales increased 2% driven by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and higher net selling price partially offset by lower inventory levels. Although year-over-year volume was flat in the second quarter, the number of new patients in the U.S. starting treatment increased by 6%, driven by improved payer coverage. For the remainder of 2023 we expect this improved coverage will lead to continued growth in new patients. We also expect declining net selling price on a full year basis. Test buyer continues to show robust growth with $133 million in sales in the second quarter. Sales increased 39% sequentially driven by 37% volume growth that benefited from the introduction or self-administered, pre-filled, single-use pen approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the first quarter. The pen offers patients a convenient option to administer TEZSPIRE at home, which improves accessibility and provides more flexibility and treatment options for all patients in the U.S. with severe, uncontrolled asthma. Sales of TAVNEOS were $30 million in the second quarter. U.S. volumes grew 28% quarter-over-quarter driven by an increase in new patients starting treatment. In the U.S. approximately 2000 patients have now been treated with TAVNEOS by over 1300 healthcare providers. Looking forward, Amgen\u2019s deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence will allow us to bring TAVNEOS to even more patients with ANCA associated vasculitis. AMJEVITA sales increased 29% year-over-year for the second quarter, driven by 60% volume growth partially offset by lower inventory levels and net selling price. U.S. sales decreased 63% sequentially driven by inventory drawdowns after stocking to support a launch in the first quarter, partially offset by volume growth. Moving to our hematology and oncology business, which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO. Strong commercial execution and exciting new clinical data drove 12% volume growth year-over-year for these six innovative products. BLINCYTO sales grew 48% year-over-year with adoption across academic community and pediatric centers. Following positive data from the registration enabling E1910 study presented in December of 2022, an updated NCCN guidelines that were issued in May. Both the positive data and the updated guidelines support our confidence in the continued growth potential for BLINCYTO. Vectibix sales increased 20% year-over-year for the second quarter, driven by 20% volume growth supported by promotion of positive data from the Phase 3 PARADIGM trial demonstrating the superiority of Vectibix over bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy for patients with wild-type RAS, colorectal cancer. KYPROLIS grew 9% year-over-year driven by 15% volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price. And LUMAKRAS reported $77 million of sales for the second quarter. Year-over-year sales were flat in the quarters. 20% volume growth was offset by lower net selling price and inventory levels. We see future growth opportunity for LUMAKRAS driven by launches in new markets and our comprehensive global clinical development program. Our execution is strong across the business driving growth and exemplifying our dedication to serving patients. Our business is performing at the very high level and with the announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, we have the potential to serve many more patients who can benefit from our decades of leadership in inflammation and nephrology. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave Reese. Dave Reese : Thanks, Murdo. Good afternoon everyone. For R&D, the second quarter was one of high quality execution as we progressed our innovative pipeline with two important data readouts, multiple registration enabling studies on track and additional exciting data coming later this year. Beginning with oncology, we are exceptionally pleased to announce positive top line results from the global Phase 2 DeLLphi-301 trial evaluating tarlatamab, a first-in-class DLL3 targeting BiTE molecule in patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer that progressed after two or more prior lines of treatment. Tarlatamab demonstrated an objective response rate at the primary endpoint that substantially exceeds what was previously reported in the Phase 1 study. Responses were durable and longer than what is expected with standard of care chemotherapy. Safety and tolerability were also more favorable compared to the Phase 1 study. This is the first time the device-specific T cell engager has shown unequivocal activity in a common solid tumor, a real milestone in the field. We look forward to discussing these data soon with the FDA and other regulatory agencies and presenting detailed results of this potentially registrational Phase 2 study at an upcoming Medical Congress. Based on the data we have observed, we are moving tarlatamab into earlier lines of therapy with DeLLphi-304, a Phase 3 study underway comparing tarlatamab with standard of care chemotherapy and second-line small cell lung cancer. We are also planning to initiate two additional Phase 3 studies of tarlatamab in earlier lines of small cell lung cancer. From my personal vantage point, as an oncologist, I believe this molecule can be transformative and can\u2019t wait to share these data with the field. Turning to LUMAKRAS, we continue to execute on our comprehensive clinical program designed to generate the breadth of data necessary to understand KRAS biology and the role LUMAKRAS can play in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and other solid tumors. We are delighted to announce that the global Phase 3 CodeBreaK 300 trial evaluating LUMAKRAS combined with Vectibix in chemo refractory metastatic KRAS G12C mutated colorectal cancer met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival for both the 240 milligram and 960 milligram doses. At comparable doses, efficacy results were consistent with what was previously observed in this setting with no new safety signals. We look forward to sharing these results with global health authorities and presenting the detailed results at an upcoming Medical Congress. The FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation to LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix for the treatment of patients with metastatic KRAS G12C mutated colorectal cancer as determined by an FDA approved test who have received prior chemotherapy based on data from the prior CodeBreaK 101 study. Beyond these data, we continue to explore novel combinations as we seek to move LUMAKRAS into the first-line setting. Recently presented data from the SCARLET study provide the rationale to initiate a Phase 3 trial of LUMAKRAS combined with chemotherapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer patients with PD-L1 negative tumors and Phase 1b data in combination with Vectibix and chemotherapy support the initiation of a Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS with Vectibix and FOLFIRI in first-line G12C mutated colorectal cancer. In June, the FDA approved the supplemental biologics license application for BLINCYTO for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients with CD19-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease greater than or equal to 0.1%. The approval converts BLINCYTO\u2019s accelerated approval to a full approval. Global regulatory submissions are on track for E1910, a Phase 3 trial conducted by the National Cancer Institute, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and the American College of Radiology Imaging Network, Cancer Research Group that demonstrated superior overall survival with BLINCYTO treatment added to consolidation chemotherapy over standard of care consolidation chemotherapy in newly diagnosed adult patients with Philadelphia negative ALL who were MRD negative following induction and intensification chemotherapy. Three important updates were made to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines in oncology in B-cell ALL. These included listing the BLINCYTO E1910 regimen as the only preferred regimen for the first line treatment of Philadelphia negative adult patients adding BLINCYTO to multi-agent chemotherapy as consolidation in MRD negative disease. And lastly, moving BLINCYTO in combination with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor to the top of the treatment algorithm or MRD negative Philadelphia positive disease. Finally, in April, data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrating that BLINCYTO added to chemotherapy improved two-year survival in KMT2A-rearranged B-ALL in infants as compared to historical data, BLINCYTO two-year survival was 93% versus 66% or chemotherapy alone. If you look at the totality of the data, it is clear that BLINCYTO is changing the paradigm for the treatment of B-cell ALL in late-stage disease, in early disease, in young patients and in older patients. We remain excited about its future potential and are focused on further investigating BLINCYTO in earlier lines of treatment and improving patient convenience through subcutaneous administration. As the first BiTE [ph], BLINCYTO also provides a roadmap for the development of molecules such as tarlatamab, which could have enhanced activity in settings of lower tumor burden. Two additional early oncology programs to watch are Xaluritamig and AMG 193. Xaluritamig is a first-in-class steep one targeting bispecific being studied in advanced prostate cancer where steep one is expressed on almost all tumor cells. We are observing significant anti-tumor activity with this molecule and are rapidly enrolling dose expansion cohorts. Xaluritamig provides another example of a bispecific T-cell engager demonstrating activity in a solid tumor setting. AMG 193 is a first-in-class small molecule MTA cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor being studied in patients with advanced MTAP-null solid tumors. The overexpression of PRMT5 in the absence of MTAP leads to the accumulation of MTA and we leverage this biology in the unique design of AMG 193, which requires the presence of MTA to effectively inhibit PRMT5. Alterations in this pathway occur approximately 15% of solid tumors are often associated with a poor prognosis and historically have been very hard to drug. We are currently enrolling a Phase 1b/2 study of AMG 193, and while it is early, we are encouraged by the anti-tumor responses we\u2019ve observed in multiple tumor types. We look forward to sharing data from both Xaluritamig and AMG 193 this fall. In general medicine, we are advancing our cardiovascular franchise and emerging portfolio of obesity molecules with a focus on clinical trial execution. The Phase 3 outcomes study of Olpasiran are potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA molecule and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is enrolling well as is a Phase 2 study of maridebart cafraglutide formerly known as AMG 133 in patients with obesity with or without diabetes and related comorbidities. The goal of the Phase 2 study is to generate data that will provide broad optionality to design a Phase 3 program leveraging the unique properties of maridebart cafraglutide that will deliver strong sustainable weight loss. In May, as mentioned, we presented data from a real world study of nearly half of a million post-menopausal women with osteoporosis in the United States Medicare program showing Prolia substantially reduced fracture risk in patients versus oral alendronate. In addition, the same study showed that longer duration of Prolia treatment was associated with a greater reduction in major osteoporotic fracture risk. These data are a great demonstration of the importance of Prolia in treating post-menopausal osteoporosis and the ability to study treatment effects in large patient populations using real world evidence. In inflammation beyond severe asthma, we are investigating multiple additional indications with TEZSPIRE including separate Phase 3 studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. We also have two Phase 2 studies, one in chronic spontaneous urticaria and the other in COPD. The CSU study is complete with top line data anticipated in imminently. The COPD trial is fully enrolled and has recruited a broad population of COPD patients, including patients with both high and low eosinophil counts. We look forward to the readout of this study in the first half of 2024. Rocatinlimab first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Recruitment is off to a strong start on the ROCKET Phase 3 clinical development program. We are also planning to initiate a Phase 2 study in moderate to severe uncontrolled asthma as we explore rocatinlimab in this additional indication. Rounding out the clinical summary, we\u2019ve continued to execute those on time and on budget with our biosimilars portfolio, including the recent initiation of a pivotal study evaluating the pharmacokinetic similarity of ABP 206 compared with OPDIVO one of six planned new biosimilars. In closing, I\u2019d like to highlight our recently announced collaboration with TScan Therapeutics. This is a multi-year collaboration that will use TScan\u2019s proprietary target discovery platform, TargetScan to identify the antigens recognized by T-cells in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease and represents a novel approach to investigating this tough to treat illness. I\u2019d like to thank Amgen staff around the world for their relentless focus on execution as we work hard to meet the needs of the patients we serve. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Peter. Peter Griffith : Thank you, Dave. We\u2019re pleased with our strong second quarter performance. Growing volumes by 11% increasing investment in research and development and delivering 8% year over year non-GAAP EPS growth. This drives our confidence in delivering against our 2023 objectives and keeps us in position to meet or beat our longer term commitments. I\u2019ll review our second quarter results before discussing our 2023 guidance. As a reminder, these results and outlook reflect Amgen on a standalone basis without any adjustments for the announced Horizon acquisition. Turning to our second quarter financial results, which are shown on Slide 41, total revenues of $7.0 billion grew 6% year-over-year and represent the highest quarterly revenues in Amgen\u2019s history. Product sales increased 8% while total revenues increased 7% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Second quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 7% year-over-year. We invested in and advanced our pipeline and accelerated growth across our priority marketed products, while delivering a non-GAAP operating margin as a percent of product sales of 52.6%, demonstrating expense discipline. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the quarter increased 7% year-over-year, reflecting growing investments in our pipeline, driven by higher spending on late stage programs and marketed product support. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 2.4 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 17.1%, primarily driven by higher profit shares and a changes in product mix. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the second quarter decreased 6% year-over-year. We continue to focus on our continuous improvement operating model, prioritizing investments, digitalization and driving productivity and beginning and in other cases continuing. What we have already started historically to execute in any number of uses of artificial intelligence. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were a net $307 million expense in the second quarter. This year-over-year favorability was driven primarily by the change in Beijing accounting from equity methods to a mark-to-market investment with the impact included only in our GAAP results. As expected, our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate increased 1.7 percentage points to 16.4%, primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change that replaced the excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, we continue our priority investments in the best innovation, both internal and external innovation. In Q2, we drove higher spend in late stage programs, such as AMG 133 an olpasiran as well as support for our marketed products, including [indiscernible] Second, we continue investing in our business. Capital expenditures are at near peak levels driven by simultaneous construction of our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. We expect our annual capital expenditures to begin to decline starting in 2024 with the completion and licensing of our Ohio plant and capital expenditures will then begin to return closer to historical levels over the coming years. And third, we plan to continue to return capital to our shareholders. We pay dividends of $2.13 per share in the second quarter, representing a 10% increase over the second quarter of 2022. The company generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow in the second quarter of 2023 versus $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the timing of tax payments and includes higher interest income and higher operating income. We expect strong cash flow for the remainder of the year, consistent with our full year 2023 financial outlook and includes a non-GAAP operating margin of roughly 50%. Now turning to the outlook for the business for 2023 on Slide 43. Our guidance is currently provided on the Amgen standalone business and does not include any Horizon projections. As the Horizon transaction is expected to close by mid-December, resulting contributions from Horizon would be included after that period. Given our strong performance, we are raising our 2023 revenue guidance to $26.6 billion to $27.4 billion versus previous guidance of $26.2 billion to $27.3 billion. Although our results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance, we expect the third quarter sales maybe lower compared to the second quarter, due to the impact of the Medicare donut hole, which is more pronounced in the second half of the year, and also to certain favorable changes to estimated sales deductions in the second quarter. Regarding our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we intend to increase investments in our internal innovation and priority marketed products from a position of strength, given the acceleration in our business and our pipeline, reflecting our improved revenue outlook along with our investment plans we are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $17.80 to $18.80 versus previous guidance of $17.60 to $18.70. Again, although our results give us confidence to raise our full year non-GAAP EPS, we expect third quarter non-GAAP EPS to be lower compared to the second quarter, resulting from the expected Q3 sales and our investments in the business. Important additional points to consider as you model the remainder of 2023, we now project full year Neulasta sales of approximately $800 million and full year combined KANJINT and MVASI sales of approximately $900 million. We now expect other revenue for 2023 to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion versus our prior range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Note that our third quarter 2022 results included about $90 million of other revenue related to our COVID antibody manufacturing agreement and the milestone we earned that we do not expect to repeat in the third quarter of 2023. We anticipate full year non-GAAP operating expense for 2023 to increase by closer to 3% versus last year compared to our previous estimate of a 1% increase with higher cost of sales from projected increase sales, additional investments driving our innovative pipeline and increase support for our growing priority marketed products, including Repatha and Otezla. We continue to expect a full year 2023 operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50%, although will vary in each of the remaining two quarters. We continue to expect non-GAAP cost to sales as the percentage of product sales will be between 16% and 17%. We now expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2023 to increase about 5% year-over-year, which is higher than our prior guidance of 3% to 4%. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to be slightly down year-over-year as a percentage of product sales. We now expect non-GAAP other income and expenses to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion down from the prior guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. For the full year, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.5% to 18.5% down from prior guidance of 18.0% to 19.0%. We expect Q3 tax rate to be near the upper end of the revised range of 17.5% to 18.5%. Our capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at approximately $925 million in 2023. Our confidence is strong in the long-term outlook and long-term growth for Amgen, and we look forward to completing the announced acquisition of Horizon by mid-December as Bob indicated. I\u2019m incredibly grateful to our 24,000 plus colleagues for successfully executing on our mission of serving patients in the second quarter and beyond. This concludes the financial update. I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob for Q&A. Bob Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Peter. And now we\u2019ll open the line for callers so they can ask questions. And I just ask our operator to remind you of the procedures for doing that, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. Maybe one question on OX40. There are some concerns and people are talking about the safety of OX40. Like one concern is regarding the autoimmune phenomena, and I\u2019m reading some literature and suggests that in OX40 \u2013 lacking OX40 animal models, there is an impairment of interferon gamma. So just trying to understand how are you managing that risk in this particular drug? And how is it \u2013 what we mean phenomena? Is it a concern at all there? Thank you. Dave Reese : Yes. Thanks. This is Dave. So we\u2019re aware of those conversations. What I can tell you is that let me approach your question in two parts. One mechanistically, OX40 is primarily expressed on activated T cells and activated pathogenic T cells in the setting of atopic dermatitis. In the Phase 2 program, we did not observe autoimmune phenomena. Obviously, this is something we are tracking, but we have no clinical signal or indication of such concerns at this time. Likewise, your question regarding interferon gamma would imply risk, for example, for infections. That\u2019s also something that we did not see at a greater rate in treated patients than placebo in the Phase 2 program. These are things that we will follow, they\u2019re followed routinely for almost all cytokine inhibition programs. But to date, we have not had signal. Operator : Thank you, Mohit. Our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Yee : Hey guys, thanks for the question. Bob commented about the enthusiasm for the Horizon deal. I know in general there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the TED market going on with sales. Can you maybe just describe your ongoing confidence with what you think is going on in the TED market, why you\u2019re excited about this and your confidence around regrowing this business? And have you been in discussions or at least aware of the ongoing dynamics or at least an ongoing dialogue with the company about the market for TED? Thank you. Bob Bradway : Yes. Sure, Mike. We can answer in two parts. Maybe I\u2019ll kick it over to Murdo in a moment. But let me just reiterate that we remain very excited and of course, we\u2019re watching carefully developments in the marketplace and talking as appropriate with our friends at Horizon about that. And again based on our view of the clinical data and our view of the international opportunities and ability to expand the reach of the product, we\u2019re very excited about what we think we can do there. But Murdo, why don\u2019t you elaborate further. Murdo Gordon : Yes. From our vantage point, Mike, what we see is strong execution by the Horizon team in the U.S. and there\u2019s several catalysts for growth here. They\u2019ve already expanded their commercial footprint, and so that should start to take traction. They have the data now for the low CAS patient population with the positive results from that trial in public domain, not yet published, but in public domain having been presented and in hand with their sales forces. So that\u2019s very recent and not reflected necessarily in their historical performance. Bob mentioned the international market launches. We continue to believe post-close, we will be able to help accelerate the work being done there. We\u2019re also seeing some improved medical policies being issued prior to the new calendar year and so that\u2019s very encouraging to see payers improve or remove restrictions, I should say, on the use of TEPEZZA for the lower CAS patient population. So there are many good catalysts, and what I see is horizon systematically unlocking those additional opportunities for growth, and we remain quite bullish on TEPEZZA\u2019s utility across a very large population of thyroid eye disease patients who would benefit from that treatment given the clinical data. The last thing, I should mention on TEPEZZA is they also were able to replicate the low cast population results in OPTIC-J, in their OPTIC-J trial. Sorry, they\u2019re not the low cast, but the registrational data for thyroid eye disease in OPTIC-J. So that sets them up well for future potential launch in Japan. So really good data flow, really good execution and investment and focus here. And look beyond TEPEZZA. We also remain very, very excited about their other two large inline brands with KRYSTEXXA and obviously UPLIZNA. So overall, we remain excited and confident that the two companies working together on this really strong portfolio will be a good parent. Operator : Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Salveen Richter : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Could you put the top-line Phase 2 data for tarlatamab in small cell lung cancer into context for us, and share any more details on the profile. In particular, how does this compare to the Phase 1 data where you had a confirmed objective response rate of 23% in a median duration of response of 13 months? I think you noted it substantially exceeds the Phase 1 results. Thank you. Dave Reese : Yes, Salveen, thanks for the question. Very, very excited about this small molecule. If you step back, I think, it represents what we had hoped to see in the BiTE platform and substantial clinical effects in a major solid tumor. To put the data in the context in comparison to a Phase 1, as noted, we substantially exceeded the 23% response rate that we reported in Phase 1. We are planning to present these data at a Fall Conference on embargoed in terms \u2013 of course, in terms of providing more specifics. But I can tell you that it couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the response rate data, the duration of response, and overall survival. For context in patients with small cell lung cancer in the third-line response rates are typically well under 50%, but importantly, they are vanishingly brief in most instances, often a matter of weeks or a few months. And so, based on what we\u2019re observing, I think we really have a chance to change the natural history of this disease, particularly as we march towards earlier lines of therapy where the activity of the BiTE in a lower tumor disease burden setting should be enhanced as we have observed with BLINCYTO. So all of our efforts now are focused on executing earlier line trials. So, this is one to I think pay attention to as we go forward and we\u2019re really looking forward to presenting these results this fall. Salveen Richter : Dave, you want to say anything about safety? Obviously \u2026 Dave Reese : I\u2019m sorry. And in terms of the safety, I think we have learned a lot in the development program about the clinical management here. We\u2019re quite pleased with the rates of principal side effects, like cytokine release syndrome and we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ll look forward to sharing those details as well when we present the data this fall. But exceptionally happy with the tolerability and safety profile as well. Operator : Thank you, Salveen. Our next question comes from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jay Olson : Oh, hey, congrats on the quarter and especially the tarlatamab and LUMAKRAS results. And happy birthday to Arvind. Arvind Sood : Thanks. Jay Olson : For the LUMAKRAS Phase 3, in colorectal cancer. Can you just talk about the filing strategy and timeline, and maybe a little bit about the market opportunity in CRC for LUMAKRAS? Thank you. Bob Bradway : Yes. In regards, this is obviously a smaller patient population, about 4% of colorectal cancers harbor the G12C mutation. In terms of next steps here our plans are to have discussions with the FDA and other regulatory authorities on these Phase 3 data. And as those conversations on unfold, I\u2019ll provide guidance about the potential regulatory pathway. And then, as I mentioned, based on the strength of these data and Phase 1b data in the first-line setting using a Vectibix chemotherapy LUMAKRAS combination we are also advancing a Phase 3 trial in first-line disease. So, I think its full steam ahead in colorectal cancer as well. And again, I\u2019ll give guidance about next steps as we\u2019ve had the appropriate conversations. Operator : Thank you, Jay. Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Raymond : Thanks. And warm birthday wishes to Arvind from us here at Piper as well. Just a question on am AMJEVITA. So, obviously the uptake in the U.S. has not been maybe what was originally sort of contemplated, when you guys were first talking about that opportunity. But maybe a couple questions. Can you maybe talk about first maybe the split in scripts between the high and low priced SKU. And then second, maybe there\u2019s been a lot of talk around what AbbVie has done to sort of blunt uptake, biosimilars to date. What, if anything on their part has surprised you guys, maybe the most in terms of what they\u2019ve done and what\u2019s the plan maybe going forward? Arvind Sood : Sure. Yes. Do you want to take that, Murdo? Murdo Gordon : Sure. Thank you for the question, Chris. We\u2019re obviously very early innings still in this biosimilar market with AMJEVITA, and we\u2019re seeing clearly what is new payer behavior in light of such a large product having biosimilar competition. With respect to the high versus the low, we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s kind of a different mix. We see mostly the high in PBM utilization and the low in the IDN utilization where the low cost \u2013 low net cost is attractive to them. But again, it\u2019s very early in the product mix, I don\u2019t think has settled out yet between those two SKUs. I would also say that we are still waiting to see what happens in the next payer negotiation cycle going into 2024. As you\u2019ve seen many of the PBMs are on record as saying that they haven\u2019t done a whole lot in terms of driving utilization of biosimilars in 2023, but plan to do more of that in 2024. So I think there\u2019s a lot more to follow here. And with respect to AbbVie strategy, look, we compete against them in the innovative site and we now compete against them with our biosimilar, and we know their practices well. So not a lot of surprises there, but I think the \u2013 I think that the clarity of how pharmacy benefit works with biosimilar uptake, or lack thereof is becoming clear to us and to other biosimilar manufacturers and other onlookers. So more to follow there. I would say though, we remain very excited about the growth of biosimilars in the longer term. We continue \u2013 as Dave mentioned, we continue to commit research investment in the development of additional biosimilars with most recently with the initiation of ABP 206, a biosimilar to OPDIVO. We also are continuing to look at being able to launch other biosimilars in the medical benefit reimbursement system in the U.S. and that\u2019s where we were successful, obviously with KANJINTI and MVASI in our previous launches. So going forward, the majority of our biosimilar growth will come from ex-U.S. and U.S. medical benefit biosimilars. And we continue to believe we\u2019ll be able to generate strong growth. Having previously said that we would more than double our 2021 annual sales of roughly $2 billion. Operator : Thank you, Chris. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. And Dave, I felt like you were on a roll on Arvind\u2019s birthday today, so congrats on all the data. My question is three and a half month was the PFS in the prior data, I think it was 20 plus percent response rate. And judging by the way you were describing it as transformative, is it fair to say PFS also improved in a meaningful way in the DL3 study? And secondly back on the horizon deal, I feel like two things are clear. You\u2019re very committed to the deal, but also that TEPEZZA is falling dramatically short at least so far. And the question that\u2019s coming up from investors is, is there any way to renegotiate the purchase price? Thank you very much. Dave Reese : Yes. What I can say Umer, without getting into specifics on the number being under embargo is that I\u2019m very happy with the overall \u2013 the efficacy package \u2013 overall response rate, progression-free survival, duration of response, and overall survival. And we\u2019ll have presentation of all of those data at an upcoming medical Congress. But to me this is \u2013 it\u2019s a very, very compelling efficacy package. Murdo Gordon : Okay. And on horizon, Umer, you\u2019re right, we remain enthusiastic about proceeding on the basis of the deal that we announced. I would take issue at least with our perspective is different from what was implicit in your question, but we\u2019ll leave that for another day. Operator : Thank you, Umer. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Yaron Werber : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I have a question on OTEZLA and sort of as relating to Enbrel too, specifically, Enbrel sort of bouncing back, which is good to see. It looks like that\u2019s really a net benefiting from the contracting that you\u2019ve put in place given AMJEVITA and generic Humira. OTEZLA though is facing SOTYKTU, which is actually doing pretty well in terms of uptake. It\u2019s got a benign label and obviously a drug program. What gives you a lot of confidence in the outlook ahead? Thank you. Bob Bradway : Thanks Yaron for the question. Yes, you\u2019re right. Enbrel has \u2013 did have a strong quarter and is benefiting from quite frankly, the best access we\u2019ve ever had on Enbrel, where we\u2019re covered across all the major PBMs now. So we\u2019re seeing really nice new patient growth on Enbrel, so more new patients coming onto treatment with Enbrel, and we think that that will support sustained volume through the course of the year. We did give up a bit of price to do that, so that\u2019s also flowing through Enbrel. But overall, I think there was some concerns perhaps last quarter that the biosimilar activity in this category was somehow impacting Enbrel. And I was pretty clear last quarter that wasn\u2019t what we were seeing. And it\u2019s definitely now clear in second quarter that biosimilar competition for Humira is not negatively impacting Enbrel. So we\u2019re \u2013 we see stability in Enbrel going forward. For OTEZLA, we\u2019re actually seeing some strength in OTEZLA. We are pleased with what new patient acquisition looks like. We think we can do better and we \u2013 as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, are investing more in OTEZLA through the backend of this year. And Peter also mentioned that. And the reason we\u2019re optimistic is we\u2019re gaining momentum in helping those post topical first systemic patients. And the epi here is pretty significant as there\u2019s 1.5 million of these patients in the U.S. that persist with topical treatment. That would be better being initiated on a systemic agent. And OTEZLA is really the ideal for a systemic agent. We have great commercial coverage with OTEZLA with very little prior authorization requirement. We have no testing requirement for initiation. And the affordability and out-of-pocket is very good. So OTEZLA is an attractive option for PBMs and pairs to maintain on their formularies. And it\u2019s an easy option for dermatologists as the first systemic agent that they would choose for a patient coming off the topicals and being treated. And again, this is milder form of disease and no one else has indicated for that mild population from a systemic perspective. So overall, the thesis is good. Now, I think, SOTYKTU coming into the market clearly put pressure on us where there were patients who were probably on our oral and didn\u2019t have full resolution of their psoriasis symptoms and they would\u2019ve switched to SOTYKTU. What we\u2019re seeing is that, that has slowed. We are losing less to SOTYKTU in our current mix of patients that we have on Otezla. And we think that the other \u2013 the other dynamic that put pressure on us in the first part of the year was the topical treatments also had free goods programs out there, and they were getting trial, and that has abated, they flattened out. So we\u2019re getting less pressure from topicals and much less patient movement away from Otezla to SOTYKTU. So I think we really have to see into 24 how the access will evolve for the novel agents, but we\u2019re very confident with our current access and the current perception of the safety and efficacy of Otezla, we can further penetrate that population of patients. So going forward, we\u2019re feeling good about it. Operator : ,: Gregory Renza : Great. Thanks. Thanks guys. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. Bob, we certainly appreciate you framing up the case for the Horizon deal before the eyes of regulators and the courts. And maybe just to build on the conviction that, that you laid out, I just wanted to ask on your thoughts on the implication to potentially a negative outcome on the biopharma, value creation, ecosystem and essentially the ability for companies like Amgen to, to bring medicines to patients. So if we just call it that this novel legal theory like bundling does prevail what impact would that have? And maybe to that, how far would you and the Amgen team really be willing to take this to preserve that opportunity to close the deal? Thanks so much. Bob Bradway : Well, again, I think I would reiterate what I said in my prepared remarks, right, which is that they, we don\u2019t believe that their case is based on any established antitrust law. We think it\u2019s based on hypotheticals and speculative notions. And we look forward to having a chance to assert that in court. And again, we expect to prevail in court. And I think what \u2013 what\u2019s implicit in your question is the recognition that we live in a very fragmented industry, and that there are a lot of innovators in particular that are a size that makes it difficult for them to capitalize on the full potential of their innovation, especially globally. And so there is a role for companies like ours to play in bringing value to companies like Horizon. We\u2019ve talked about it repeatedly, but we think the capabilities we have with our global commercial organization that demonstrated expertise we have in manufacturing, research and development for products like this, I think will enable us to reach far more patients than the company would be able to on its own. So this is an industry that has flourished by being able to capitalize on the innovation ecosystem that exists for biotechnology companies, for the most part in the United States. And again, we expect that that will continue and think that were it not possible for companies to combine to benefit from each other\u2019s strengths, the result would be fewer innovation, reaching fewer patients. So that would be an unfortunate outcome. Operator : Thank you, Gregory. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Evan Seigerman : Hi guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Maybe one for you, Dave; can you just expand on the biologic rationale to target steep one versus PSMA and prostate cancer? And I\u2019m asking this in context of an update you we had from a competitor today, whereas their PSMA program different than yours, they had to modify significantly due to safety issues? Thank you very much. David Reese : Yes. Thanks Evan. We\u2019re \u2013 so a couple reasons to target steep one. Number one it\u2019s almost universally expressed on advanced cancer cells. There is not e extensive high level normal tissue expression, so that allows you to generate the therapeutic window that we\u2019re always looking for with bispecific T-cell engagers. PSMA has been a challenging target. There appear to be unique properties with that target. As I think you\u2019re aware, multiple molecules including some of our own have gone into and then fallen out of clinical development. And I\u2019ve come to the belief that that maybe in part target related. So steep one is a relatively novel target, we are in the clinic, I think are far advanced compared to anyone else. And based on the clinical data that we\u2019re seeing now, this is a program we really want to accelerate. This is another one of the programs where, we\u2019ll be presenting data this fall and either urge you to put [indiscernible] under the radar screen and pay attention to those data; but this one I think has a real opportunity. Operator : Thank you, Evan. Our next question comes from Colin Bristow from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Colin Bristow : Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for clicking the questions. Maybe just a quick one on TEZSPIRE, and you have the upcoming COPD data in the first half of 2024. I was just curious as to get your expectations here. What\u2019s the threshold for success, especially in light of the recent sort of very positive [indiscernible] data? Thank you. Bob Bradway : Yes. I think in light of what we\u2019ve seen in the field, we would love to see something that is competitive with that. Just to level set everyone, the rationale for this study is that the target of TEZSPIRE, TSLP is expressed in bronchial mucosa. Sputum can be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with COPD. The pathway may be a contributor or driver of exacerbations and that\u2019s really the hypothesis that we are testing here. So we\u2019ll look at the totality of the clinical data, but I think some of the things you\u2019ve seen recently published give us benchmarks as to what we\u2019ll hope to see. Operator : Thank you, Colin. Our next question comes from Dane Leone from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Dane Leone : Thank you. Maybe just two quick ones for me; firstly, in terms of the rebound in Otezla and the good strength that seems to be coming out of some of those trialing periods for competitive products on the topical side and also oral side. Can you just maybe provide whatever response makes sense to your competitors\u2019 analysis on the oral side suggesting they\u2019ve achieved over 40% TRx share and whether you think that share could go back in favor of Otezla during the back half of this year, or is that something you would see steady state from here on out? And then secondly, just regarding the Phase 2 tarlatamab, is there anything we need to be aware of that maybe the patient population in this Phase 2 small cell lung cancer study, was maybe less heavy or pre \u2013 less heavily pretreated as opposed to what was seen in the Phase 1 study, which is sometimes the case? Thank you. Arvind Sood : Yes, why don\u2019t we take it in two parts? Bob Bradway : Yes. Dane, I\u2019ll attempt to answer your Otezla question. As I said, we are encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in the market here. It\u2019s really hard for me to comment on market share claims from other companies, particularly when that they\u2019re adding what we can see versus what we can\u2019t see in their free drug program. So they\u2019re giving a lot of product away, and I think they\u2019re including that in their denominator when they\u2019re providing share. I actually don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be reflective of what their ultimate in market performance will look like, because we\u2019ve seen that in many categories where free programs or bridging programs are not representative ultimately of the final access picture and the final effect that new access picture will have on demand. So, I think that given our very good access coverage with little to no prior authorization requirements across many of those plans, we are definitely in a position should some of those free drug patients end up getting rejected for sustained actual insurance coverage. Because of the broad coverage, we have not factored that into our go-forward, but it could happen. Arvind Sood : Regarding tarlatamab, no substantive differences, very heavily pretreated our population. We\u2019ll provide details this fall. Operator : Thank you, Dane. Our next question comes from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. Could you please provide an update on your oral obesity Phase 1 trial, and also discuss your evaluation of backup candidates? Thanks very much. Bob Bradway : Yes, in terms of the oral obesity program, it\u2019s moving through, it\u2019s Phase 1, which includes, single dose and short-term multiple dose. We expect probably now to have data in the first half of next year. Behind that we have multiple programs looking at orthogonal mechanisms of action, many of them non-incretin based. And as some of those progress towards the clinic, we\u2019ll start to talk about them and give you insights into our portfolio approach here. So thank you. Arvind Sood : Hey, Julian, why don\u2019t we take one last question as we are over our allotted time? Operator : Certainly. Our final question will come from Robin Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Robin Karnauskas : Great, thank you. So congratulations on tarlatamab, or I\u2019m going to call TMAb to make my life easier. But can you just opine a little bit, usually first, the first innovators expand a market like small cell to be much bigger than what people think of today. And walk us through the cadence of these Phase 1 trials in particular, I think the checkpoint inhibitor combination trial, like when could we see data from that and how do you view like even Harpoon, the competitive landscape and how you are differentiated from them? Thanks so much. Arvind Sood : Sure. Let me start with the tarlatamab [ph]. I\u2019m extremely enthusiastic about this molecule, you know, as always, I\u2019ll let others talk about their molecules. But, this one is one that we\u2019re really putting muscle behind to sort of level set everyone here. As you start to think about the unmet medical need, there are roughly 240,000 cases of lung cancer in the United States each year. Roughly 15% of them are small cell lung cancer, comparable numbers in Western Europe for example. So that gives you a sense of the patient numbers. The clinical development program overtime is going to be designed to look at really that broad swath of patients. Of course, we\u2019re starting in third-line therapy, but our goal here is to quickly advance into second and earlier lines of treatment. And, we\u2019ll talk more about those clinical studies as we get through later in the year. But this is one again, where I think when we get into settings of lower tumor burden as we\u2019ve observed with BLINCYTO, we can really affect the natural history of the disease. Recall that upon initial diagnosis, only 7% of patients with small cell lung cancer will be alive five years later. And that\u2019s the opportunity to change that, I think is in front of us now. Bob Bradway : Okay. Well, thank you for your question Robin, and thank you all for joining. As Arvind said, we know we\u2019re a couple minutes over allotted time, so I want to be respectful of your calendars, but I also just do want to make one more statement, if I may, which is before we break, I wanted to announce that after nearly 19 years in the role Arvind Sood will be transitioning his Head of IR responsibility to our Treasurer, Justin Claeys. And Arvind will remain a VP in Finance and will help Justin transition seamlessly into this new role. So he is, while he is not leaving this is nonetheless a big moment and I wanted to acknowledge it because I know Arvind is something of a legend and a fixture in the investor relations world. And I \u2013 on a personal note, I want to just add that I\u2019ve worked with Arvind now for more than 20 years. So we began working together even before we both joined Amgen. So I want to publicly congratulate him on his accomplishments in the IR profession. And I want to again, publicly state that I\u2019m delighted that he\u2019s going to remain part of the finance group working with me and Peter and the rest of the team. So on his birthday, we have a second thing to celebrate, which is the culmination of nearly 19 years in his role at Amgen. And those of you, who haven\u2019t met Justin, will enjoy getting to know him. He\u2019s been with Amgen for more than 20 years and served as our Treasurer for most of the past four years. So I know you\u2019ll all join me in wishing Justin well as he begins his transition into this role. And I know you\u2019ll all join me in wishing Arvind a good celebration here with us later this evening. Thank you. We\u2019ll talk to you after the next quarter. Arvind Sood : Great. Thank you everybody. And we\u2019ll keep in touch. Operator : This concludes our 2023 Q2 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : My name is Julianne, and I'll be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Justin Claeys, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Claeys, you may now begin. Justin Claeys : Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Murdo Gordon, Vikram Karnani, who joined Amgen from Horizon Therapeutics following the October 6, 2023 acquisition close, Dave Reese and Peter Griffith. Given the timing of these Horizon Therapeutics acquisition close, our third quarter results do not include any contribution from Horizon. Vikram will provide select information from Horizon's third quarter product sales for future context. You should have received a link to our slides that we have posted. Through the course of our discussion today, we will make some forward-looking statements and use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance. And just a reminder that actual results can vary materially. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. Robert Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Justin and thank all of you for joining our call. It's an exciting time here at Amgen. And we're continuing to execute well this year, serving many more patients around the world with medicines such as Repatha, EVENITY and Tezspire, advancing a number of promising first-in-class medicines rapidly through our pipeline and preparing for our next wave of biosimilar launches. However, as this is our first earnings call following the close of our acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, I thought we might turn our attention there first. The Horizon acquisition, coupled with our purchase of ChemoCentryx, which we acquired a little more than a year ago, gives Amgen a significant rare disease business that fits squarely within our overall strategy and will be additive to the growth we expect from our base business. At the heart of our strategy of course is innovation. First, our best-in-class medicines that make a big difference for patients suffering from serious diseases. The medicines in our rare disease portfolio like Tavneos, Tepezza, KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA fit this description perfectly and they'll benefit from Amgen's decades of experience in inflammatory diseases. These medicines are also early enough in their lifecycles that we can positively impact their growth by leveraging Amgen's capabilities in process development, lifecycle management and manufacturing. Finally, we spent the past decade or so building out our international footprint with Amgen medicines now available in about 100 countries. And today our rare disease sales come almost exclusively from the U.S. So, we'll be able to leverage our global presence to quickly bring these medicines to patients around the world. You'll hear more in a minute from Vikram Karnani, who joined us through the Horizon acquisition and is leading a newly created rare disease business that is now the fourth leg of Amgen's commercial stool, alongside our inflammation, oncology and general medicine businesses. Turning to our financial performance in the quarter. Total revenues were up 4% and earnings per share were up 6% compared with a year ago. Volume increased 11% globally, which represents our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth. And we achieved good balance across all of our geographic regions and therapeutic areas. Seven of our medicines generated record sales in the quarter. And I'll highlight one of these, BLINCYTO, which delivered 55% sales growth in the third quarter. We see continued upside potential for BLINCYTO as it is increasingly used in earlier lines of therapy and as practice guidelines are updated to reflect the role this medicine can play in treating a broad range of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Turning to our pipeline. We had the opportunity to discuss six potential first-in-class oncology assets with you recently following ESMO. Three of these have earned Breakthrough Therapy designations from the FDA; tarlatamab, BLINCYTO and LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in colorectal cancer. We also continue to progress trials for bemarituzumab in gastric cancer, for Xaluritamig in prostate cancer and for AMG 193, our PRMT5 inhibitor, which has generated responses across six solid tumors. I'll just quickly note that AMG 193 was identified through our proprietary DNA encoded library technology which we added through the 2019 acquisition of Nuevolution, and it demonstrates our leadership in the emerging field of multi-specific drugs that can address pathways that have long been recognized but considered inaccessible to traditional drug discovery efforts. In other pipeline news, we've completed enrollment in our Phase 2 obesity study for maridebart cafraglutide, which was formerly known as AMG 133. And finally, the FDA has accepted our BLA for our biosimilar to EYLEA. Looking at our business, we feel we have good momentum across the board. We have everything we need with the portfolio, the pipeline and the people to deliver attractive sales and earnings growth through the end of the decade and beyond. As always, I want to thank Amgen employees around the world, including some 2,000 new colleagues focused on rare diseases for their commitment to strong execution on behalf of the patients we serve. With that, I'll now turn it over to Murdo Gordon. Murdo? Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Bob. I'm pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Execution is strong across the business with record quarterly sales for seven brands and robust volume growth across our general medicine, inflammation and hematology/oncology portfolios. Product sales increased 5% year-over-year. Volume growth was 11% with strength across our regions. U.S. volume growth was 11% and volume growth in our Europe, Latin America, Middle-East and Canada region was 8%. Consistent with our international expansion strategy, Asia-Pacific continues to be our fastest growing region with 27% volume growth in the quarter. Starting with our general medicine business, which includes Repatha, Prolia, Evenity and Aimovig. Overall revenue for these four products grew 21% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by 20% volume growth. Repatha sales increased 31% year-over-year in the third quarter, with volume growth of 44%, partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., volume growth of 45% was driven by a record number of new patients starting treatment, more than doubling year-over-year. We saw declining net selling prices in the US, primarily driven by new formulary coverage by CVS in July for commercial patients. Outside the U.S., we saw a 43% volume growth with strength across our regions. There are still many more patients around the world who can benefit from Repatha and we're rising to meet that challenge by investing and executing to drive awareness amongst physicians and patients. In the U.S., we have significantly expanded our primary care sales force and activated more than 15,000 new prescribers this year. We're also increasing promotion to patients through direct-to-consumer media efforts. Transitioning to bone health, Prolia sales grew 14% year-over-year in the third quarter, primarily driven by 7% volume growth and higher net selling price. We expect volumes for Prolia to grow supported by real-world evidence data presented earlier this year that demonstrate Prolia's superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with post-menopausal osteoporosis. EVENITY had record sales of $307 million for the quarter, driven by 48% volume growth. Osteoporosis disproportionately impacts postmenopausal women, and the diagnosis and treatment rates for these patients are low. In 2023, we expect approximately 3 million patients in the U.S. will be treated for post-menopausal osteoporosis, an estimated 40% of treated patients will be at very high risk of fracture. But only 6% of those high risk patients will be treated with a bone-building product. EVENITY plays an important role in the bone builder market with a 58% share in the U.S. and a 44% share in Japan. There's much more work to be done and we'll continue to invest to ensure EVENITY reaches the patients who need it. Otezla sales declined 10% year-over-year, driven by lower net selling price, unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions, and lower inventory levels, partially offset by 1% volume growth in the U.S. Otezla net price declines were driven by higher rebates to support and expand access for commercial and Medicare Part-D patients. Our U.S. Otezla business has been impacted by free drug programs associated with new treatment options that have entered the psoriasis marketplace. We're beginning to see a reduced impact of these free drug programs as physicians and patients are experiencing barriers to access, given prior authorization requirements for these newer therapies. We have strong conviction in the growth potential of Otezla, with its unique indication for all severities of psoriasis, combined with an established clinical profile, broad payer coverage, a lack of testing required for initiation and convenient oral administration. To realize that potential, we have increased our investment to ensure physician and patients understand both the importance of treating psoriasis systemically and the safety and efficacy profile that Otezla offers. We are already seeing positive results from that increased investment, including significant growth in the number of patients requesting educational information and taking action on the Otezla website that generally indicate preparation for a discussion with the healthcare professional. And also recently increased our dermatology sales force by 20% to educate physicians about the benefits of Otezla for appropriate patients. With these increased investments, we expect to drive a return to growth for Otezla. Enbrel sales decreased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by an 8% decline from unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. Year-over-year volume increased 1% in the third quarter and the number of new patients in the U.S. starting treatment increased by 22% driven by improved payer coverage and Enbrel's 20-plus year track record of safety and efficacy. For the remainder of 2023, we expect our improved coverage will lead to continued growth in new patients and declining net selling price. Tezspire continues to show strong growth with $161 million in sales in the third quarter. Sales increased 21% sequentially, driven by 18% volume growth that benefited from the launch of our self-administered pre-filled single-use pen, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the first quarter. We've now obtained coverage of the patent with the majority of pharmacy benefit managers, enabling easy access and convenient self-administration for patients in the U.S. with severe uncontrolled asthma. As we expected, Tezspire has both penetrated and helped grow the U.S. asthma biologics market. In 2023, the number of new patients on asthma biologics has increased by over 20% year-over-year and Tezspire's share of this expanded market is approximately 20%. Sales of Tavneos were $37 million in the quarter with 26% quarter-over-quarter volume growth. In the U.S., approximately 2,300 patients have now been treated with Tavneos by over 1,500 healthcare professionals. We continue to see an increase in awareness of Tavneos by rheumatologists and nephrologists. And exiting the quarter, we saw an increase in new patient start forms. Looking forward, we expect to bring Tavneos to even more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Amjevita sales increased 30% year-over-year for the third quarter, driven by 53% volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price. Ex-U.S. sales increased 10%, driven by 22% volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price. Moving to our hematology-oncology business, which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO . Strong commercial execution and compelling new clinical data drove 15% volume growth year-over-year for these six innovative products. BLINCYTO sales grew 55% year-over-year to a record $220 million for the third quarter. Volume growth of 56% was supported by broad prescribing to acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients following positive data from the registration-enabling E1910 study presented late 2022, and updated NCCN guidelines that were issued in May. Long-term, we see significant additional growth potential for BLINCYTO from earlier lines of therapy. LUMAKRAS reported $52 million in sales for the third quarter, a decline of 31% year-over-year. $22 million of this decline was driven by ongoing reimbursement negotiations in France. We see future growth opportunities for LUMAKRAS, driven by launches in new markets and our comprehensive global clinical development program. Vectibix sales increased 2% year-over-year for the third quarter to a record $252 million, driven by higher net selling price and 4% volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact. KYPROLIS grew 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by 8% volume growth. And Nplate sales increased 45% year-over-year for the third quarter, resulting from a $142 million order from the U.S. government. In the fourth quarter, we expect to fulfill an additional $62 million order for Nplate by the U.S. government. Given the strong performance of our hematology-oncology products and the exciting new positive data presented at ESMO on our oncology pipeline, we look forward to helping more patients with their cancer therapy. Overall, our execution is strong across the business, driving growth and demonstrating our dedication to serving patients. And with the expansion of our rare disease portfolio, we're excited to serve many more patients around the world who can benefit from our therapies. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram. Vikram Karnani : Thanks, Murdo. We're excited to bring together Horizon's medicines, pipeline and rare disease expertise with Amgen's history of leadership in inflammatory diseases, global infrastructure and world-class biologic capabilities. For those that are not as familiar with Horizon's portfolio, I will spend the next few minutes providing some background on our rare disease medicines. Horizon's business delivered $945 million of sales in the third quarter, representing 2% year-over-year sales growth with multiple positive leading indicators. Let me describe in more detail. Tepezza, the first and only medicine approved for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, regardless of disease activity or duration, generated $453 million of sales in the third quarter, representing 2% quarter-over-quarter growth. We are confident that now as we have officially joined forces and have on-boarded the full commercial team, we will make significant progress in advancing this important product over time to patients. We are driving several initiatives to continue to build the U.S. thyroid eye disease market. In the third quarter, we saw a greater than 50% year-over-year increase in the number of Tepezza prescribers, supported by the April 2023 FDA label update to treat patients with thyroid eye disease, regardless of disease activity or duration. We are pleased with this progress and are continuing to educate the physician community on new clinical data and updated indication across the full spectrum of TED patients. Second, large national and regional payers are continuing to make favorable policy changes to help eligible patients access Tepezza. To date, we have obtained favorable policy changes for greater than 30% of U.S.-covered lives, which are expected to take effect later this year and early next year. As a reminder, for Tepezza, there is a time lag between a patient being identified for Tepezza treatment and treatment being initiated. It can take up to 90 days for a patient enrollment form to move through the prior authorization process. Once that step is complete, then the patient's infusion needs to be scheduled at an appropriate site of care. This process takes time and we have taken several important steps to minimize the time between patient identification and treatment initiation. Finally, we continue to see approximately 100,000 patients with moderate-to-severe disease in the U.S. that are appropriate for Tepezza, with the majority of these patients in low Clinical Activity Score settings. Therefore, the patients -- the FDA's label update, combined with favorable medical policy changes by payers and supported by the expanding base of prescribing physicians, gives us a significant opportunity to reach more patients. These positive execution trends underpin our confidence in Tepezza's growth potential in the U.S. Moving on to markets outside the U.S. We continue to see international expansion as a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for Tepezza which received its first ex-U.S. approval in Brazil in the second quarter of this year. We are particularly excited about the opportunity to leverage Amgen's long-standing presence in multiple major ex-U.S. markets, including Europe and in Japan, where we have reported positive data from the Phase 3 OPTIC-J trial. We also continue to enroll a Tepezza Phase 3 trial in Japanese patients with chronic or low clinical activity thyroid eye disease. KRYSTEXXA, the first and only medicine approved for uncontrolled gout, delivered a record $253 million of sales in the third quarter, representing 32% year-over-year growth. Sales are now annualizing at a $1 billion run rate. Performance in the third quarter reflected continued strong uptake in both the rheumatology and nephrology segments. Strong results were driven by execution across all phases of the patient journey, demand-generation, stakeholder education and adherence to treatment. The FDA approved KRYSTEXXA's label change for combination with methotrexate in July 2022. We have seen a steady increase in uptake since then. Immunomodulation usage remained above 70% of new patient starts in the third quarter. We see an opportunity to redefine KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate as a standard of care and reach even more of the over 100,000 uncontrolled gout patients in the U.S. UPLIZNA sales increased 54% year-over-year in the third quarter to $67 million. International expansion is also underway with UPLIZNA now launched in multiple ex-U.S. markets, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Brazil. Additional indications in development also support UPLIZNA's long-term growth potential with Phase 3 trials underway in both IgG4-related disease, and myasthenia gravis. The rest of Horizon's portfolio generated $173 million of sales in the third quarter, primarily driven by our portfolio of ultra-rare medicines; RAVICTI, PROCYSBI and ACTIMMUNE. We see an opportunity for this basket of products to continue to generate robust sales. Before I turn it over to Dave Reese, I want to take the opportunity to thank all my colleagues in the rare disease business for maintaining their focus on patients throughout a period of distraction over the last several months. Looking ahead, we are excited to work together by leveraging Amgen and Horizon's combined capabilities to ensure our medicines reach more patients even faster who are suffering from serious and rare diseases globally. I'll now turn it over to Dave. David Reese : Thank you, Vikram. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by welcoming our new colleagues from Horizon. We are excited to be integrating Horizon's R&D capabilities with Amgen's to advance the promising Horizon pipeline. For R&D, the third quarter was one of high quality execution as we progressed our innovative pipeline with important oncology data readouts, the addition of two breakthrough therapy designations and completion of enrollment on key studies. We also advanced our innovative pipeline through rapid enrollment on multiple registration enabling studies. Starting with general medicine, we have completed enrollment in the Phase 2 study of maridebart cafraglutide in patients with obesity with or without diabetes. The goal of this study is to generate data that will provide optionality to design a broad Phase 3 program, leveraging the unique properties of maridebart cafraglutide that could potentially allow us to take a differentiated approach. We anticipate top-line data from this 52-week study towards the end of 2024. The Phase 3 outcomes study of Olpasiran are potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA molecule in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is enrolling very well. In inflammation, beyond severe asthma, we are investigating additional indications with Tezspire, including separate Phase 3 studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, which is fully enrolled and eosinophilic esophagitis. We also have a Phase 2 study in COPD that has been fully enrolled with top-line data anticipated in the first half of 2024. This study has recruited a broad population of COPD patients, including patients with both high and low eosinophil counts. Rocatinlimab, a first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, recruitment is off to a strong start on the ROCKET Phase 3 clinical development program. We have now randomized over 1,500 patients across the program. We are excited to present additional data from our expanded rheumatology portfolio following the acquisition of Horizon, including data from a Phase 2 study of dazodalibep in Sjogren's Syndrome, along with data from KRYSTEXXA, Tavneos, Otezla and other molecules from our broad portfolio at the American College of Rheumatology Convergence 2023 Meeting in November. I'll be brief with my remarks on our oncology portfolio, given the detailed oncology review last week. Based on the E1910 Phase 3 study, the FDA has granted BLINCYTO Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with CD19-positive Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia during the consolidation phase of multiphase therapy. We see future growth in BLINCYTO from advancements into earlier lines of therapy and subcutaneous administration. BLINCYTO also serves as a blueprint for how we plan to rapidly progress tarlatamab and Xaluritamig into earlier lines of therapy [indiscernible] setting a lower tumor burden. Along with experts in the field, we are very encouraged by tarlatamab, our BiTE molecule, targeting DLL3. At ESMO, we presented data from DeLLphi-301, a Phase 2 study in late-stage small-cell lung cancer, where we saw impressive response rates, durability of response, and overall survival in a setting where patients typically have limited options and a very poor prognosis. We are submitting these data to the FDA and are pleased that the FDA has granted tarlatamab Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Given our confidence in these data, we are rapidly advancing tarlatamab into earlier lines of treatment with multiple Phase 3 studies underway or planned. Based on emerging clinical data, we are discontinuing PSMA-targeting bispecific AMG 340, and we will focus our efforts on rapidly advancing Xaluritamig in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. We expect Xaluritamig dose expansion cohorts to be fully enrolled by the end of the year, and are planning to initiate additional studies in patients with earlier-stage prostate cancer. With AMG 193, a small molecule MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor, we are encouraged by the responses we've seen across six MTAP-null solid tumors, the manageable safety profile and preclinical evidence of CNS penetrants. We are now rapidly enrolling dose expansion cohorts. And with that, I'll turn things over to Peter for the financial update. Peter Griffith : Thank you, Dave. I'll review our third quarter results before discussing our updated 2023 guidance. Turning to our third quarter financial results, which are shown on Slide 44, total revenues of $6.9 billion grew 4% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.96 grew 6% year-over-year. The growth in revenues was due to product sales increasing 5% year-over-year, driven by a 11% volume growth. Third quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year. We advanced our pipeline and invested in growth opportunities in the quarter, while delivering a non-GAAP operating margin as a percent of product sales of 52%. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 1.3 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 17.4%, primarily driven by higher profit shares and changes in product mix. Non-GAAP R&D expenses in the quarter decreased 2% year-over-year due to lower spend in research and early pipeline activities, partially offset by higher spend in later-stage clinical programs and marketed products. Year-to-date, non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 5% due to higher spend in later-stage clinical programs and marketed products, partially offset by lower spend in research and early pipeline. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the third quarter increased 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments, digitalization, driving productivity and accelerating use cases for artificial intelligence. Non-GAAP OI&E were a net $225 million expense in the third quarter. The year-over-year favorability was driven primarily by higher interest income and the change in Beijing accounting from equity method to a mark-to-market investments, with the impact included only in our GAAP results. Our third quarter non-GAAP tax rate increased 3.2 percentage points to 16.1%, primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change that replaced the excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, we continue to prioritize investments in both internal and external innovation. In the third quarter, we increased investments in programs, including maridebart cafraglutide, I'll call it mari from now on, Rocatinlimab, Tavneos and ABP 206, our biosimilar to OPDIVO. Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth, including through simultaneous construction of our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. We're excited for the anticipated licensure of our Ohio facility in the first half of 2024. Additionally, we're making investments in all parts of our business to leverage the power of Generative AI opportunities. Third, we have a strong track record of returning capital to our shareholders and pay dividends of $2.13 per share in the third quarter, representing a 10% increase over the third quarter in 2022. The company generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the third quarter of 2023 compared with $2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2022. We will continue to generate strong cash flows. However, Q4 cash flow will be lower than historical patterns due to the timing of tax payments and Horizon transaction-related expenses. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2023 on Slide 46. We're pleased to have closed the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics. We're updating our full-year 2023 guidance to include Horizon financial results starting October 6, 2023. So our Q4 results will exclude approximately one week of Horizon's results. We are raising our 2023 revenue guidance to$28.0 billion to $28.4 billion versus previous guidance of $26.6 billion to $27.4 billion. For 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share, we are narrowing the range to $18.20 to $18.80 versus previous guidance of $17.80 to $18.80. We will add Horizon's business into Q4 without material non-GAAP EPS dilution. However, we do expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS to be lower than Q3 non-GAAP EPS because of planned investment increases in our business, including key assets in our innovative pipeline, beginning with mari, Olpasiran and AMG 193, and other strategic business investments, including Generative AI use cases in all parts of our business. This sequential pattern is consistent with historical trends. And in addition, Q4 non-GAAP EPS will begin to include the recognition of interest expense related to the Horizon financing as a non-GAAP expense, important additional points to consider as you model the remainder of 2023. We now expect other revenue for 2023 to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion versus our prior range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. With the Horizon acquisition, we now anticipate full year non-GAAP operating expense for 2023 to increase from our previous estimate of 3% (ph) to approximately 10% versus last year. Horizon represents approximately 5 percentage points of this 10% year-over-year increase. We continue to expect the full year 2023 operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50%. We continue to expect non-GAAP cost of sales as a percentage of product sales to be between 16% and 17%. We now expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses to increase from our prior guidance of 5% to about 10% year-over-year. Horizon represents approximately 3 percentage points of this 10% year-over-year increase. The additional 2 percentage points are driven by planned increase in our investments in our innovative pipeline, including mari, Olpasiran, and AMG 193. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A to be down year-over-year as a percentage of product sales slightly. We now expect non-GAAP OI&E expenses to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, up from our prior guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. We expect Q4 OI&E to be about $700 million, reflecting interest expense related to the Horizon financing, which will be included in our non-GAAP results effective October 6. And as you begin to model 2024, note that we expect 2024 OI&E to be consistent with this Q4 run rate. This higher interest expense is driven by the $28 billion of debt raised for the Horizon acquisition at a weighted average interest rate of 5.6%. We expect to end 2023 with approximately $65 billion of long-term debt, including the current portion of it, and $11 billion of cash and cash equivalents. For the full year, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5% to 17%, down from prior guidance of 17.5% to 18.5%. We expect approximately 540 million shares to be outstanding in Q4. This increase from Q3 is driven by the conversion of unvested Horizon equity awards and the Amgen equity awards. Our 2023 capital expenditures are now projected to be approximately $950 million, up from our prior guidance of $925 million. The addition of Horizon's rare disease team further strengthens our confidence in delivering against our long-term growth objectives. We continue to allocate capital to advance innovation at speed and at scale. And I'm incredibly grateful to our now 26,000-plus colleagues for successfully executing our mission of serving patients. This concludes the financial update. And now, I will ask our operator, Julianne, please open the lines for Q&A and remind our participants of the procedure to ask their questions. Julianne? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Yee : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for all the details around the Horizon transaction. I just wanted to ask a question to David Reese. I mean, David unless we're hiding under a rock, I guess obesity is like the biggest thing ever now and wanted to understand your commentary and confidence around 133 and the profile around what you think that could be relative to leaders and how 786 would fit into that given such a high bar for other orals? Thank you. David Reese : Yeah. Sure. As we've discussed before, Mike, with 133, we believe we have a potentially differentiated product based on the mechanism of action, it's a bi-functional to remind everyone, that antagonizes GIPR based on a genetic evidence, largely compiled by us, with two GLP-1 peptides stapled to the molecule for that mechanism of action. As I noted in the remarks, we've rapidly enrolled the Phase 2 trial. There are multiple arms to this trial that explore three different doses as well as different dosing intervals that I think will give us broad optionality going forward. We were quite pleased with the Phase 1 data in terms of depth of response, the kinetics of response, as well as persistence, and these are the things that we will be looking at in Phase 2 as we go forward. So it's full steam ahead on this program. And we're looking forward to data from the Phase 2 trial next year which will really inform the breadth of the Phase 3 trial that we're contemplating, which could be quite large. In terms of AMG 186 -- or 786, this is an orthogonal mechanism of action. We're bringing in data. And as we've indicated, after, you know, the first half of next year or so, we anticipate presenting those data in determining the path forward. As you note, it's a high bar in this field and we'd have to see the sort of profile that would, give us the confidence to invest broadly in a molecule like that. I would also note, we've got a suite of preclinical molecules, many of them non-incretin based in terms of mechanisms of action that we will be bringing forward over the next few years. So this is an area where we expect it to be a long-term player. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Yaron Werber : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Peter, just for you, the $700 million run rate, that was interest expense only, right? That's not including where you're recording sort of the Beijing contribution in the line right above it in terms of other income. And then just secondly, again on your guidance, you also mentioned 3% to 10% increase year-over-year And you mentioned 5% to 10% going to R&D. The 3% to 10% increased -- just remind us what that was, because SG&A is expected to be down, right, slightly year-over-year, so I just missed what that was. Peter Griffith : Right. Thank you, Yaron. The 700 is everything, so that's the full run rate. And on the question on R&D, as I said in my remarks, we've focused our spending on the later clinical and in-market portfolio that was slightly offset by some decreases in early research. But we continue to spend and invest in the business and we'll continue to do that. As you can see, we're fortunate to have a significant number of opportunities in Phase 3 in the later stages. So that's what we'll stay focused on, will continue to differentially invest in the opportunities in innovation and we're very excited about that. Operator : Thank you, Yaron. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Terence Flynn : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-parter from me for Peter as well. Peter, again, I know you went through a lot of numbers there at the end. But in terms of the revenue guidance raise for the year, can you just characterize if that was all coming from the Horizon portfolio or if there was any other contribution from the underlying base business? And then the second part of the question is just any directional help with how to think about 2024 tax rate, as I know there's a number of moving pieces from some legislation, but then you obviously have the Horizon deal close. So just directionally, can you help us out in 2024 tax rate? Thank you. Peter Griffith : Yeah. So -- excuse me. On the tax rate, let me start with that '24 tax rate. We'll guide on that as we always do at the beginning of the year. I would just say, I think you're thinking about the global minimum tax and Pillar 2, and I would just note, there is no consensus or predictability about how that whole OECD framework is going to be implemented. I know different countries are doing different situations. Rest assured, we look at everything, optimize our position as appropriate on something like that. So we'll give you guidance on that next year at the beginning of the year. First part of the question? Robert Bradway : Revenues. Peter Griffith : Yeah. On revenue, look, we don't really break that down. I would just suggest that we continue to see strength in the business and we continue to see our in-line portfolio perform very, very well. I would just note, we had seven products with record sales in the quarter, we had Repatha up 31%, up in the quarter year-over-year. And we've continue to see the hematology-oncology portfolio was up 16%. So everything's, strong in our base business. We're excited about that base business, that continues to perform really well and we're very excited to have the rare disease business now. And looking forward to having that as, as we said, it's kind of the four stool of our commercial thrust forward. So we're seeing good strength around the business in different areas and we'll just continue to get more and more medicines to patients. I'd note, the 11% volume growth is really important. Underneath that 12% volume growth outside the United States. And underneath that 27% volume growth in JPAC, our fastest-growing region. So that's how we're looking at that. We're pleased with the momentum and we're pleased to be able to raise the 28.0 to 28.4. Operator : Thank you, Terence. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Salveen Richter : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With regard to the Horizon transaction, now that it's closed, could you just walk through the outlook for Tepezza and the other assets as we look to 2024 here? You talked about initiatives that you have to expand the patient population in ex-U.S. being a growth lever. Just maybe walk us through that and when we might get updated long-term guidance, including Horizon. Thank you. Robert Bradway : Yeah. Maybe we'll take this in two parts, Salveen, it's Bob. Obviously, we're not going to provide '24 guidance here this morning. But we'll see whether we can give you a clear sense of the things that are exciting us when we look at those products for -- heading into next year. And just generally on the question of long-term guidance, as you've heard us say on a number of occasions, we remain confident that we're on track to meet or beat the objectives that we established for 2030, in some ways now frankly, we're more focused on what we can deliver through 2031 and soon to be 2032 as well. So we reviewed -- in-depth review of the oncology portfolio a couple of weeks ago and gave you a good sense for the moving pieces through the end of the decade. And we may seek to present a picture of the business in that way now heading into next year, so that you can get a more comprehensive deep-dive into the different segments of the business that are driving growth. But let's turn to first question, which is the outlook for Horizon and the initiatives that are underway, in particular, with respect to Tepezza, and KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA. So Vikram, why don't you fire away? Vikram Karnani : Yeah. Thanks for the question. I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we have a lot of positive leading indicators as we look at the business. I'll start with Tepezza. We're continuing to build that U.S. TED market following the FDA's April 2023 label updates. And that really helps us get the medicine to TED patients regardless of disease activity or duration. And what we've seen following that label update is that the payers are continuing to update their medical policies and make them more favorable so that more of these patients, more in the low CAS setting or the low Clinical Activity Score setting can now access Tepezza. And I think, finally, from an execution standpoint, we see newer prescribers from both ophthalmologists, as well as endocrinologists increasing 50% year-over-year in this third quarter. So all of these indicators for Tepezza are positive and we feel good about the execution of the team. And as I said, we have now combined forces with Amgen and together we should be able to drive business in a positive way moving forward. Think -- talking about -- the story around Tepezza also is one of international growth. While we see a lot of positive trends in the U.S., we're pretty excited about what we can do as a combined company for patients outside the U.S. as well. We've talked about Brazil getting approval recently. We've got [indiscernible] OPTIC-J as our trial in Japan. We've talked about the chronic trial that's enrolling. And finally, we're getting ready for other markets and we hope to bring the medicines to many more markets now as part of the combined company than we were talking about previously. So Tepezza, both signs very positive in the US as well as globally. And as we've talked about the results for KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA, both those medicines performed really, really well. We have immunomodulation with KRYSTEXXA being a major driver since the label update last year. That has continued to drive uptake since that time. We see that continuing into the future. And with UPLIZNA, it is the fastest-growing biologics in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders or NMOSD, and we see that momentum continue both in the U.S. as well as outside the U.S. So I think when I look at the overall portfolio we have, we're operating from a position of strength and now we can expand that even further with the combination with Amgen. Salveen Richter : Thank you, Vikram. Operator : Thank you, Salveen. Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jay Olson : Hey, congrats on all the progress on so many fronts. Could you talk about your investments in AI technology and how that may influence your drug discovery and development over the next five to 10 years? Thank you. Robert Bradway : Sure. I'll ask Dave Reese to address that, Jay. David Reese : Yeah. Thanks, Jay. This is an area where we're very excited. You know, I'd like to characterize it as the hinge moment where we're seeing the coming together or the unification of technology and biotechnology. I really think this is going to affect over time a qualitative change in how we do drug discovery and drug development. So everything from protein structure prediction, protein-protein interaction, prediction at the molecular level, to multiomic analysis on extraordinarily large datasets which can -- which is only tractable through AI or machine learning, dense clinical trials data and then real-world evidence and real-world data. When you look across that spectrum, I believe we probably have the largest datasets in the industry. And so we are putting the tools in place and the foundation or models to really mine those data for deeper insights in the biology and then all the way out into the market. We'll talk about this more over time. But this is going to be an area of investment and it can be overhyped. It's not a panacea, but it is absolutely going to be the most powerful tool we've seen in a long, long time. Operator : Thank you, Jay. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Dave, I have a two-part question on AMG 786, the oral for obesity. First, I noticed you guys dropped a cohort in your SAD portion of the trial. Is that because you ran into MTD? And then also, I noticed the exclusion criteria around suicide ideation were intensified and I can't tell if we could be reading into that or not, would love to get any color. Thank you David Reese : Yeah. Thanks. On the latter, I wouldn't overthink that at all. I don't think there's anything there. In terms of the dosing that we do, this is always adjusted as we move through Phase 1 trials. As I've indicated, we're bringing in the data now, we're taking a look at that. And the constellation of clinical data -- updated preclinical data, and I think we'll have that all together as we go into next year and that will determine the potential path forward for AMG 786. And just to remind everyone, this is a target that is not an incretin-based target. Operator : Thank you, Umar. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Robyn Karnauskas : All right. Thanks for taking my question. I do have a follow-up to Salveen's question actually. So Tezspire has gotten a lot of market share, there is so much room to grow in the TED space. Can you walk me through, like how Amgen can actually help grow that business because I'm confused by whether it's the hearing loss or reimbursement or what are really the levers that will actually grow that company -- grow that business -- Tepezza, sorry, Tepezza, that I think that there's a lot of room to grow. And given your strength, you could probably make that work. So, how do you intend to do that? Robert Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Robyn. So I think it's a two-part question there on Tepezza. We may tackle it in two parts with the combination of Vikram and Murdo. So go ahead, Vikram, why don't you start? Vikram Karnani : Yeah. Thanks for the question. Like I said earlier, the -- I think one of the areas that has -- something that happened this year was the FDA update. Now when the label updates to patients that are treated regardless of disease activity or duration, many of these patients, in fact, I would say more of these patients are being treated by prescribers, such as endocrinologists and ophthalmologists. And that's what the team has been focused on working through, making sure that our educational program is available to these physicians, so that we can widen our prescriber base from the original set of prescribers that started treating patients at launch. So it's really important to understand that expanding the prescriber base is a critical driver for that success going forward. And as we've seen new prescribers have increased 50% year-over-year. As we continue to work through these new -- this low CAS or low clinical activity patients, we also have to remember that when they are prescribed the medicine, payers need to open up access to the medicine. So our market access team has been working pretty diligently to make sure that payers continue to update their medical policies. And what we have seen is more than 30% of U.S. covered lives are now eligible patients that can access Tepezza with more open or more favorable policies. This has to continue and both of these are areas that we will continue to work on as we go into early next year and beyond. And maybe I'll turn it over to Murdo to add his comments as well. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks, Vikram. Hi, Robyn. I would add, much the same way when we acquired ChemoCentryx and Tavneos, we realized that there was a low level of awareness of Tavneos. What we did there was we added reminder messaging to some of our broader rheumatology-covered sales forces to increase awareness of the data associated with Tavneos in ANCA-associated vasculitis patients. We've seen a corresponding increase in utilization, of course, driven by awareness of that product. So the core team is still promoting the attributes of the product and educating physicians, but there is a broader group of field personnel building general awareness of that product. What I think Vikram and I are talking about is the Amgen teams that cover endocrinologists were involved in the diagnosing and treatment of Thyroid Eye Disease, would be an ideal opportunity for us to broaden the awareness amongst that community of endocrinologists who are diagnosing and treating thyroid eye disease today to augment the great work that is happening with the rare disease teams under Vikram's leadership. So there's a number of things like that where we can scale and speed up the building of awareness, for example, of the new data that Vikram was just describing and the broadening of the label language. Vikram also mentioned the international expansion. The original plan was quite ambitious for Horizon. We've actually increased the number of markets that we intend to file and launch in, in a shorter period of time. So that would be an additional opportunity for growth given the strength of the two companies now combined. Robert Bradway : Might just add also, Robyn, that in terms of the time course of events here, I think now that we flip back on a year of ownership of ChemoCentryx, we can really start to see the benefit of what Murdo just described kicking in, over the last few weeks and months. So it takes a little bit of while, but I think our confidence is that over that period of time, we've been able to find ways that we can add distinctive value to that product and we're hoping a similar thing will happen with respect to the new rare disease molecules that we brought on board. So it's not like walk in, flip a light switch and suddenly things are performing on a different track, but rather you come in, work together, identify the ways in which we can be additive in the marketplace. And I'm hopeful that we'll see during the course of '24, the momentum build for the combined organization on these products. Operator : Thank you, Robyn. Our next question comes from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much. And so my question is on oral obesity development. Regarding Phase 1 candidate 786, management has consistently emphasized that it also has a suite of oral preclinical product. And so should we take away that we should be viewing 786 as more of a wild card, rather than something that Amgen has conviction in at this point? And when do you expect to be able to start Phase 1 for another oral preclinical candidate? Might that happen in '24 or not until '25? And then separately, just I wanted to squeeze in a quick financial question. Do you expect Horizon product channel inventory work down in the fourth quarter to significantly constrain reported net Horizon sales in the fourth quarter? Thank you. David Reese : Yeah. Thanks, David. Dave Reese, I'll start and then turn things over to Murdo, and Vikram. In terms of oral obesity molecule 786, as I've said, it has a novel mechanism of action, it's a Phase 1 molecule. So you should view it as a Phase 1 molecule. And we're bringing in the data I said, and we'll take a look at that as we get into the new year and make a determination on potential path forward for that molecule. I wouldn't view it as anything more or less than a Phase 1 asset with a novel mechanism of action. In terms of additional molecules and when we might file INDs and launch our first in human trials, we'll give guidance as that portfolio advances over time. Again, many of those molecules are targets that we emanated from deCODE Genetics, our colleagues in Iceland. And I'll provide further information as we get ready to move towards the clinic. But this is playing a long game. If you step back, look, this field is in its infancy. We are just beginning to understand the complex metabolic arrangements that occur with obesity and there are clearly different forms of obesity. There's a lot of work to do. And as I've indicated, our intent here is to play the long game given that this is one of the major public health challenges of the 21st Century. So let me now hand it over to Vikram and Murdo for additional commentary on your second question. Murdo Gordon : Yeah, David. I just want to make sure that I heard your question right, it was about inventory and product wind-down. Look, I don't think we are going to comment on that specific aspect. I think the -- our team remains focused on driving demand and working with physicians to educate them and expanding the use of Tepezza for appropriate patients and that's where we're really focused too as a primary driver of net sales growth. Operator : Thank you, David. Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Raymond : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I just -- maybe a commercial question on your dermatology strategy and specifically on Otezla, just on the dynamic that you guys talked about with free competitor drug, presumably that's SOTYKTU scenario. And I think I heard you guys, you know, you've been calling this issue out for some time, but also with the investment that you're making in the dermatology sales force, I think I heard you say today that you're increasing that sales force sort of 20% or so. Is the implication that once the competitor free drug program runs its course, that Otezla volume should increase or what's your sense of what happens to volume? And maybe I'll ask it another way, if that volume increase doesn't materialize, do you need additional derm portfolio offerings to support that added effort? Thanks. Murdo Gordon : Thanks for the question, Chris. This is Murdo. So let's just recapitulate what's happening in this market. At the beginning of the year, you had a number of new launches, not just SOTYKTU, with novel topicals coming into the market as well as a novel oral and every one of those products had very generous free drug programs and that had two effects on Otezla. There were topical patients who would have normally moved to their first systemic option who tried the new topical treatments on a free drug basis. And at the same time, there was a launch of a new oral that had a very generous free drug program. And so, Otezla, which sources the majority of its growth from topical patients for systemic, in other words, biologic naive patients. Otezla got squeezed in the first and second quarter on the basis of those new programs coming into the market. What we've seen since those two events in the market is that the novel topicals have flattened out in their growth and have pulled back to some extent on their free drug offering. The other oral therapy SOTYKTU continues to provide free drug, and so continues to have some effect on Otezla. What we think will happen and we're already seeing the very early signals of this is that we will continue to source our new growth from the topical patients, bio-naive patients. Given that Otezla is the ideal for a systemic agent, we have established ourselves with really strong access in the market. So we don't need to provide free drug programs to the extent that everybody else is. And then as the contracting cycle for 2024 matures and we see what the actual access is for some of the other competitors in the market, including the new oral, we should be able to give better guidance on our growth prospects for the future. But we almost certainly expect the impact of the free goods program to continue to reduce and that will help us grow Otezla. The investments we've made are really just kicking in this quarter. So the expansion in the field force, and your number was right, by 20%, the derm team was just deployed at the beginning of Q4. So they are only in-field as of a few weeks. So that impact is not in the historical performance of the brand. And our direct-to-consumer spend has been increased for the fourth quarter as well. So we will be able to tell you more as we go forward, but we feel given the very large number of patients here who continue to persist on topicals, when they really are better candidates for a systemic agent, will convert to Otezla as we build into that market. And just a reminder, we're the only product in the market that has a broad label regardless of severity of psoriasis. So we're optimistic and we're enthusiastic and that's why we've made these investments and we'll continue to look to add to our dermatology portfolio as we go forward. Operator : [Technical Difficulty] Chris. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mohit Bansal : Hey. Thank you very much for taking my question and thank you for changing the time to make sure people can enjoy Halloween. So maybe one question on sequential growth. If I look at second quarter from third quarter, it seems like pretty much every product, even including Nplate accounts for the government budget, seems to be down. I know that you warned about this in the second quarter call regarding Medicare donut hole, but can you talk a little bit about the dynamics there and how should we be thinking about this going forward? Robert Bradway : Yeah, Mohit. I don't think every product is down. I think we had a number of products posting pretty significant double-digit growth in the quarter. And those are products that we continue to expect long-term growth from products like Repatha, EVENITY, Prolia, our hemo portfolio, BLINCYTO in particular. So, we're seeing some strength in our priority growth brands that we expect to continue to drive. What we did have in the quarter were a number of adjustments from prior period on net sales. So there was one particular adjustment on LUMAKRAS, which was based on a year-over-year change in the negotiations that we have on reimbursement. So in France, for example, we have an early temporary access program, and ATU program. Since 2021 LUMAKRAS has been available in France and we took a $22 million accrual in the quarter for those sales on the basis of price negotiations we are having in France. So we had a number of events like that related to price in the quarter. And as you mentioned, we are entering the donut hole for some of our products. So overall, I think unit volume growth is very strong. A few price effects on select products in the portfolio and a little bit of donut hole impact. Operator : Thank you, Mohit. Our next question comes from Gregory Renza from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead your line is open. Gregory Renza : Great. Good morning, Bob and team and congrats on the progress, and thanks for taking my question. Bob, just circling back to the obesity market again, and as you and the team focused on really being first or -- and/or best in class across markets, I'm just curious how you and the team view and anticipate how different the obesity market can look and how you see the unmet need morphing by the time a program from Amgen is ready for prime time. But would there be a need to look not just internally but externally to accelerate those efforts, especially if things are evolving so quickly? Thanks again and congrats on the progress. Robert Bradway : Now, we're very excited about what we see so far emerging from our early work in obesity. I think over time you've got the sense of this from Dave Reese. This is likely to be a heterogeneous disease, they're probably going to be a number of different ways to have to go at it. But what encourages us right now is, what we think as an emerging differentiated profile for our approach versus the competition. And maybe, Murdo, you want to just jump in and remind Gregory about the basis of differentiation that we see so far in our data from the competition and why we think that gives us a good foothold for entering the markets. Murdo Gordon : Yeah. Thanks, Bob. I like the way the question was framed. It sometimes gets framed as, what are you going to do when the -- with these entrenched products in the market. And I'd just like [Technical Difficulty] people how young this market is and how much more is left to unfold. What we're seeing in the early days is, we're seeing a lot of patients trying these products, losing weight, but then not persisting with their treatment and regaining weight. So we think that there is an opportunity in the market long term for a product that can bring about very strong weight loss, both rapid and sustained over time with convenient dosing. And I think that that's where 133 or maridebart cafraglutide really has an opportunity to differentiate itself from what is available in the market today. We've seen the durability of that product between doses, and we think based on the Phase 2 in a number of different dosing cohorts we have being explored in that trial, we will be able to find the right balance of efficacy and the ability, based on convenient dosing to sustain that weight-loss over time. And, of course, the goal here is not just to lose weight, but to improve a number of sequelae or outcomes from people who carry extra weight over the course of their life, and that's what we're starting to see with others reading out in event trials. We will see more data as the medical congress has passed these next few months. But our hope is to bring about real improvement in outcomes with a highly efficacious and highly convenient product, like 133. Operator : Thank you, Gregory. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Geoff Meacham : Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Murdo, it's been a long time coming for Repatha in submission. Are you guys finally hitting a commercial tipping point with payers, or do you think there is an increasing interest among cardiologists? I guess, I wasn't sure how, you know, the current market is and looking forward, how about the impact? How do you guys see it from a couple of the ongoing Phase 3s and 4s? Thank you. Murdo Gordon : Thanks for the question, Geoff. Yes, it's been a bit of a journey. And the COVID pandemic didn't help us in our efforts to educate and convince cardiologists that they needed to do more to be more aggressive in treating their patients; LDL, cholesterol. I do think we've reached a tipping point in cardiology and I do think we've reached a tipping point with payers. We now have over 90% commercial lives covered. We anticipate being able to continue to progress our Medicare Part-D coverage, and we're seeing, you know, the PCSK9 category driven primarily by our 80% share of that category. Really, really starting to move now. Our new patient volume growth is good, not just in the US, but around the world. We are now seeing more and more primary care physicians using PCSK9s in combination with other drugs to more aggressively lower LDL in high-risk ASCVD patients. So the phases are pretty clear, payer coverage established, affordability for patients established, cardiologists are now prescribing with frequency and now moving into primary care. And we'll be adding direct-to-consumer campaign investment to that mix. So, yeah, I think we've reached a tipping point on Repatha Geoff and I'm bullish on what we can do to further expand that product, both from a volume and net sales perspective. Operator : Thank you, Geoff. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the question. Just a question on longer-term margins. So I guess post Horizon and I guess with the ramp of your pipeline, including some potentially very large obesity studies over time, I guess, just directionally, how should we be thinking about margins from here? I guess is this kind of 50% or slightly above 50% range a reasonable target for the company, or just any considerations we should keep in mind as we kind of balance, I guess, Horizon versus investment? Thank you Robert Bradway : Well, we're not going to give updated margin guidance on this call, Chris, but I think we've been pretty clear about what the trail should look like. We're focused on remaining a leading efficient player in our industry. We've been able to achieve leading operating margins over time. There is nothing that we see in the Horizon business specifically that would lead us to conclude differently from that. So we expect that at a full run rate, capitalizing on our in-place infrastructure internationally and manufacturing and process development that the margins in that business would be attractive in our hands. And the reference that Peter made to R&D spend earlier, obviously, to the extent that we get into a number of Phase 3 trials in the middle years here of the decade for Lp(a) and for obesity products, that may have an effect on overall margins, but we'll have plenty of time to talk about that in advance so that nobody is surprised if the margin starts moving around. So again, we've demonstrated a pretty consistent ability to manage the cost structure of the business and that's something that we're determined to maintain. Operator : Thank you, Chris. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for the color on the call today. So the growth in perspective is pretty impressive. Just wondering how the mentioned $1 billion run rate compares with your expectations going into the deal. And then taking a step back, we saw on a JAMA article about the use of type 2 diabetes and then for gout. How are you seeing that in the broader gout space? Is this something we should be concerned about when it comes to KRYSTEXXA? Thank you. Robert Bradway : Maybe we'll take this in two-parts. First, with respect to KRYSTEXXA, I'd say KRYSTEXXA is performing very well and we believed it would. Again, we think there is a tremendously large unmet medical need here and that KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate is serving the marketplace well. So we're looking forward to working with our colleagues on it. And overall, I'd say that the business is proceeding as we thought it would to this point. The things that we were -- that we thought were important to have in hand, like the chronic indication for Tepezza, like, international datasets that were made available with the OPTIC-J trial, like the progress we've made in Brazil, et cetera. Those were things that we wanted to have in hand and now do. And, again, UPLIZNA also performing very much in line as we expected it would. So we see three growth opportunities there and we see ways for the Amgen-based business to add value to what Vikram will be running now in our rare business area. And then, with respect to the question on diabetes, I\u2019ll ask Dave, [Multiple Speakers] David Reese : I mean, I think, the broader context here is important. These patients have severe uncontrolled gout. They are often facing amputations, for example, because of the severity of the disease. And so there are large number of these patients that are currently not being served in the market in clinical practice. And so our focus is on reaching those patients where the quality-of-life impediments are quite significant, and the effects of the drug can be quite dramatic in improving the disease course and improving that sort of quality of life. So that's the focus right now. I wouldn't get distracted by some of the other potential associations. Robert Bradway : Now, operator, I think we have two more calls in the log here. So why don't we take two more and then we'll thank our colleagues and let them get on with the day. Operator : Certainly. Thank you, Evan. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tim Anderson : Thank you. On AMG 133, maybe this is a silly question, but is it at all possible that you can start Phase 3 in 2024? The main way to do this would be to do an early or interim look of sorts at the Phase 2 trial before the primary completion date. And I know you're guiding for top-line on that in late '24. Thank you. David Reese : Yeah. I mean, as we go through '24, we will give guidance on when we expect, you know, the Phase 3 program to launch. You know, as is customary in these programs, we will take an interim look. That will remain blinded, we will not release that externally, because this is a 52-week study, but that will help at least guide our thinking. Also recall that the FDA requires a certain safety database before you launch Phase 3 trials here. And so as we get into next year and start to have those conversations, we will be able to give more definitive guidance as to when you can expect the launch of the Phase 3 program and what that suite of studies might look like. Robert Bradway : And let's take our last question. Operator : Thank you, Tim. Our last question will come from Colin Bristow from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Colin Bristow : Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a quick follow-up on 133. Just as we think about this from a commercial perspective, this is obviously an antibody backbone. It's going to be an injectable. Just in light of margin that's achievable with this, just help us think through that. Thanks. Vikram Karnani : Well, Colin, you rightly point out that this is an antibody backbone. The properties of that, obviously, as I was alluding to earlier, could be that you can dose it much less frequently than you have to with the current therapies on the market. We also think, given the potential differentiation on efficacy and possibly tolerability, that we will be able to establish a very strong position in the market for people who need rapid, deep, and sustained weight-loss that they can manage over time, so that they can gain the benefits, the reduction in cardiovascular risk, the improvement in outcomes from that treatment. But we expect, as Dave said, to develop this product across a suite of Phase 3 experiments, and we expect to be able to take a decent share of the market, which will drive a good return on our investment in that product. Operator : Thank you, Colin. I would now like to turn the call back over to Bob Bradway for closing remarks. Robert Bradway : Okay. Well, let me thank all of you for joining us this morning. And we hope that the choice of doing this in the morning frees you up to go enjoy the afternoon and evening of trick-or-treating wherever you are. But we again, appreciate your support. It's been an eventful few months at Amgen. And we'll look forward to having an opportunity to regather with you and report on the fourth quarter when we get to the new year. Many thanks. Operator : This concludes our 2023 Q3 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Justin Claeys, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Claeys, you may now begin. Justin Claeys : Thank you, Julianne. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Murdo Gordon, Vikram Karnani, Jay Bradner, I am pleased to welcome and he is joining us for the first time on our quarterly earnings call, and Peter Griffith, Dave Reese, will also be available during the Q&A session. Given the timing of these Horizon Therapeutics acquisition close, the results as shown in our press release and slides include contribution from the Horizon business from October 6 onwards. For the avoidance of doubt, this will also be the basis for our filed financial results. To supplement this information, Vikram will also provide sales information for these products for the full fourth quarter, including the first week of October as further context in his remarks. Through the course of our discussion today, we'll use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and have provided appropriate reconciliations within the materials that accompany this call. We will also make some forward-looking statements, which are qualified by our safe harbor statement, and please note that actual results can vary materially. With that, over to you, Bob. Robert Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Justin, and let me thank all of you for joining our call. 2023 was another year of performance and progress for Amgen, further positioning us to deliver attractive growth through the end of the decade and beyond. Last year, we delivered double-digit volume growth in all four quarters with balanced growth across products and geographies. 18 [ph] of our medicines generated record annual sales, including Repatha, Prolia EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, BLINCYTO, KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA. The acquisition of Horizon, which is completed on October 6, gives us a significant new rare disease business that now stands as a fourth pillar of growth alongside our leading general medicine, oncology and inflammation businesses. The medicines we acquired are all very early in their life cycles and by leveraging Amgen's world-class biologics manufacturing, decades of experience in inflammation and our extensive global presence, we believe these products have the potential to reach many more patients around the world. Last year, we also advanced the deepest and most diverse pipeline in our history with promising molecules at all stages of development across our four pillars of growth. We anticipate well over a dozen significant pipeline milestones this year. I'll touch on a few. In General Medicine, we'll generate Phase II data this year for our lead obesity molecule, MariTide, and we're excited, of course, to learn more about this asset. We're also advancing a number of early-stage assets in this space. In Oncology, we have a June 12 PDUFA date for the FDA to complete its priority review of Tarlatamab as a third-line treatment for small cell lung cancer. Tarlatamab is the first bispecific T cell engager shown to be effective in addressing a major solid tumor. In this case, one for which there has been no new treatment in decades and which today has a 5-year survival rate of just 3%. We're studying Tarlatamab in earlier lines of treatment and hope over the fullness of time to be able to serve the tens of thousands of patients diagnosed with small cell lung cancer each year in the U.S. and major markets around the world. We've done this very successfully now with our first BiTE BLINCYTO, which has steadily moved into earlier lines of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and we'll take the same approach with yet another promising BiTE at being Xaluritamig in prostate cancer. In inflammation, we'll have Phase III data from Rocatinlimab in atopic dermatitis from the first of 1 are now 8 trials in the ROCKE program. And in rare disease, we'll have Phase III data for UPLIZNA and myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease. At a time when a rapidly aging global population needs more innovation, Amgen is delivering, both with the medicines we have in the market today and with the promising new medicines that are advancing in our pipeline. We're also excited by the rapid convergence of biotech and tech, which is enabling us to innovate more quickly and confidently. We've been preparing for this hinge moment for more than a decade and recently named Dave Reese as our first ever Chief Technology Officer to ensure that we're capitalizing on technologies like generative artificial intelligence, not just in R&D, but across the entire company. Succeeding Dave is Amgen's Head of R&D is Jay Bradner. Jay is a physician scientist and a seasoned R&D leader, having served for many years as President of the Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research. Jay previously also served as a faculty member at Harvard Medical School and prior to joining Amgen was a practicing oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We're delighted to have Jay on board and excited by the work that he Dave and the rest of our team will do together to accelerate innovation at Amgen for the good of patients and for the long-term growth of our business. And with that, I want to thank our 27,000 employees around the world for their many contributions to our success. And let me now ask Murdo to talk about our commercial performance in 2023. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Bob, and I'm very pleased with our performance in 2023. Execution was strong across the business, resulting in record sales in the year for 18 brands and robust volume growth across the four pillars of our business. Full year product sales increased 9% year-over-year. Volume growth was 15% with strength across our regions. U.S. volume growth was 14% and volume growth in our Europe, Latin America, Middle East and Canada region was 10%. Asia Pacific continues to be our fastest-growing region with 41% volume growth. These results include $954 million of sales from the legacy Horizon portfolio from the period of October 6 through December 31. I'll start with our General Medicine business, which includes Repatha, Prolia EVENITY and Aimovig. Overall revenue for these four products grew 15% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full year, driven by 18% and 20% volume growth, respectively. Repatha sales increased 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter with volume growth of 35%, partially offset by lower net selling price. Outside of the U.S., we saw 25% volume growth with strength across our regions. In the U.S., volume growth of 48% was driven by a 66% increase in the number of new patients starting treatment. We saw a decline in net selling price in the U.S., primarily driven by new formulary coverage. We expect this additional coverage to lead to strong volume growth, which will more than offset declining net selling price. In addition, some payers have recently removed prior authorization for some patients, which will further ease their access to Repatha. We remain committed to the urgent need to educate physicians and patients on the importance of LDL-C lowering to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. In the U.S., we activated more than 20,000 new prescribing physicians in 2023 in both the primary care and cardiology settings. And while we're pleased with this progress, we'll continue to work tirelessly for the many, many more patients around the world who can benefit from Repatha. Transitioning to bone health, EVENITY had record sales of $318 million for the quarter, driven by 39% volume growth. Osteoporosis disproportionately impacts postmenopausal women and the diagnosis and treatment rates for these patients are low. In the U.S., only 6% of very high-risk patients with osteoporosis are treated with a bone builder, creating an urgent need for treatment with an effective therapy. EVENITY is an important therapy to address this unmet need as it is the only bone builder that works with the body's natural ability to increase bone formation and also decrease bone resorption. We see strong growth potential for EVENITY and we'll continue to apply our proven experience in bone health to ensure it reaches all the patients who need it. Prolia sales grew 12% year-over-year to a record $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter. Volume growth of 10% was supported by real-world evidence reaffirming Prolia superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis at a high risk of fracture. Moving to our oncology business, which includes BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate and XGEVA. Sales of these six innovative products grew 5% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, with 3% volume growth. Full year sales grew 12% year-over-year, driven by 12% volume growth. BLINCYTO sales grew 47% year-over-year to a record $241 million for the fourth quarter. Volume growth of 55% was supported by broad prescribing to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in frontline consolidation treatment. Long term, we see significant growth potential for BLINCYTO from utilization earlier in the front line as part of induction treatment. LUMAKRAS sales increased 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter. We see future growth opportunities for LUMAKRAS coming from launches in new markets and additional indications. Vectibix sales increased 5% and KYPROLIS sales grew 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, both driven by volume growth. Nplate sales decreased 18% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by volume decline related to timing of orders placed by the U.S. government, partially offset by volume growth across our regions. Full year sales increased 13%, primarily driven by volume growth, including U.S. government orders. Excluding U.S. government orders, Nplate sales grew 23% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. Transitioning to our inflammation business. Otezla sales increased 2% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and 3% volume growth, partially offset by lower inventory levels and lower net selling price. Full year sales decreased 4% driven by lower net selling price and lower inventory levels, partially offset by 2% volume growth. New patient starts for Otezla grew 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by strong execution and increased investment. Competitor free drug programs had a reduced impact in the quarter. Otezla is uniquely positioned to grow in 2024 and beyond, given its indication for all severities of psoriasis, combined with an established clinical profile, broad payer coverage, a lack of testing required for initiation and convenient oral administration. Enbrel sales decreased 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by a 4% impact from unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and lower net selling price. U.S. volume grew 1% in the fourth quarter, supported by an increase in new patients starting treatment as a result of improved payer coverage. Going forward, we expect net selling price to continue to decline year-over-year driven by higher rebates to maintain broad first-line payer coverage and changes in patient mix. TEZSPIRE continues a strong launch trajectory with $177 million in sales in the fourth quarter and $567 million for the full year. Sales increased 10% sequentially, driven by volume growth. Our successful launch of a self-administered prefilled single-use pen allowed us to expand coverage with major pharmacy benefit managers to over 80%, contributing to higher new patient growth as the year progressed. Moving forward, we expect this expanded coverage will allow TEZSPIRE to help even more patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. Sales of TAVNEOS were $44 million in the quarter and $134 million for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we saw a 17% quarter-over-quarter volume growth in the U.S. Approximately 2,700 patients have now been treated with TAVNEOS by over 1,700 health care professionals. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our expertise in nephrology and inflammation to bring TAVNEOS to even more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Sales for our biosimilars portfolio grew 10% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year, driven by 27% and 29% volume growth. This volume growth was partially offset by net selling price decline. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. Overall, our execution is strong across the business, underscored by our foundational commitment to serve patients. The four pillars of our portfolio position us well to serve many more patients around the world who can benefit from our innovative therapies. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram, who will cover our rare disease portfolio. Vikram Karnani : Thanks, Murdo. I am glad to share an update on our rare disease business now that we are 4 months past due close. We are now fully operating as part of Amgen with integration activities ongoing. As Bob has mentioned before, we are excited to be Amgen's fourth pillar of long-term growth. I wanted to make sure you're aware that we are not reporting the full quarter in press release and slides, which reflects sales from October 6 onwards and totaled $954 million. This excludes $41 million of sales that occurred in the first week of October prior to deal close. For the full quarter, our rare disease brands from Horizon delivered product sales of $995 million, representing 6% year-over-year sales growth. Throughout the remainder of my remarks, I will reference full quarter product sales. TEPEZZA, and IGF-1R monoclonal antibody for patients with thyroid eye disease generated $467 million of sales during the entire fourth quarter, representing 3% quarter-over-quarter growth. This is the third quarter in a row of quarter-over-quarter growth for TEPEZZA with the growth largely driven by the U.S. We saw a number of positive leading indicators, including a record number of unique TEPEZZA prescribers, total patient enrollment forms and patient starts in 2023. Additionally, thanks to our efforts, we've been able to generate favorable medical policy changes for greater than 50% of U.S. covered lives, and we expect to continue this momentum throughout 2024. We continue to see approximately 100,000 patients with moderate to severe disease in the U.S. who could benefit from TEPEZZA with the majority of these patients in low clinical activity score settings. Given positive leading indicators and high unmet need, we see a long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA in the U.S., while also recognizing there is some time lag between our execution efforts and the realization of increased patient numbers. International expansion also remains a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA. TEPEZZA is approved in Brazil, and we are progressing towards approval in additional countries. Our expansion into both Japan and Europe is a high priority with regulatory review underway in Japan and filings in the EU throughout the year. KRYSTEXXA, a PEGylated uricase enzyme for patients with chronic refractory gout delivered a record $280 million in sales for the entire fourth quarter, representing 30% year-over-year growth, driven by continued strong commercial execution. Sales are now annualizing at $80 billion [ph] run rate. Performance was driven by execution across all phases of the patient journey, demand generation, stakeholder engagement and adherence to treatment. UPLIZNA, an anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody, which is now the fastest-growing biologic in NMOSD, delivered a record $70 million in sales for the entire fourth quarter, representing 68% year-over-year growth. International expansion is also underway with UPLIZNA now launched in multiple ex U.S. markets. Our remaining ultra-rare portfolio generated $178 million of sales for the entire fourth quarter, primarily driven by our ultra-rare medicines, RAVICTI, PROCYSBI and ACTIMMUNE. Looking ahead at 2024 by leveraging Amgen's world-class biologics capabilities, decades of experience in inflammation and extensive global presence, we are ready to reach more patients than ever before. I will now turn it over to Jay. Jay Bradner : Thank you, Vikram, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to take a minute to convey how thrilled I am to join the Amgen R&D organization and its leadership team. The creativity of our discovery research, expert and expedited clinical development, most authoritative biomanufacturing organization in the industry, all were well known to me before joining. But now on staff at Amgen, I appreciate the strong sense of service, the patients facing serious illness, the like-minded commitment, growing the impact of our medicines and our business and the shared conviction in this remarkable portfolio of potential first-in-class and best-in-class medicines. In 2023, we executed with speed across our clinical pipeline, achieving excellent enrollment in key programs and setting up 2024 as the year with significant data readouts across the portfolio for medicines with the potential to transform patient care. Key highlights in 2023 included the delivery of promising data from four key oncology assets and the attainment of three breakthrough therapy designations in oncology. We initiated pivotal Phase III studies for Tarlatamab in small cell lung cancer, LUMAKRAS in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, along with dazodalibep in Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. In General Medicine, as previously disclosed, top line 52-week data from the 592 patient MariTide Phase II study is expected by late 2024. Leveraging the durability of weight loss observed in Phase I and rapid enrollment enjoyed in Phase II, we recently added a part 2 to this study, which explores durable weight loss beyond 52 weeks. Our planning for a comprehensive Phase III program across multiple indications remains on track. Lastly, you may have seen that yesterday, Nature Metabolism published manuscript from Amgen R&D that provides the integration of MariTide preclinical and Phase I data. Beyond MariTide, our obesity strategy encompasses several assets with AMG 786 in Phase I and additional preclinical assets advancing. Our approach is tailored to meet the dynamic needs of obesity treatment, demonstrating a longitudinal commitment to innovation and patient care in this field. The Phase III outcome study of Olpasiran are potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA molecule and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has enrolled more than 7,000 patients globally. This rapid enrollment accomplished in just 1 year across 34 countries and over 700 sites underscores the medical community's strong interest in and the potential impact of Olpasiran. We've deliberately expanded our initial enrollment target from 6,000 to over 7,000 patients to ensure comprehensive demographic representation and to satisfy regional regulatory requirements. We are on track to complete enrollment in the first half of 2024. In oncology, we're focused on approaching high conviction targets with differentiated therapies for large effect size. We're pleased to announce that the FDA granted priority review for BLINCYTO in early-stage CD19-positive B-ALL with a PDUFA date of June 21, 2024. The ongoing Phase III Golden Gate study is enrolling patients to evaluate the effectiveness of alternating BLINCYTO with low intensity chemotherapy here in older adults diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL. We're also planning to amend this study to evaluate subcutaneous administration of blinatumomab with initiation anticipated in the second half of 2024 potentially allowing us to serve more patients in treating physicians. Lastly, we're pleased to announce that just today, the American Journal of Hematology published a manuscript highlighting data from the dose expansion phase of our ongoing Phase Ib study of subcutaneous blinatumomab as a single agent in adult patients with heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL. Of 27 evaluable patients treated, we observed an 85% complete response rate, of which 75% were MRD negative. Subcutaneous blinatumumab is well tolerated with no observed grade 4 cytokine release syndrome. Turning to Tarlatamab, a first-in-class DLL3-targeting BiTE molecule, the FDA granted priority review following promising results from the Phase II DeLLphi-301 clinical trial and a PDUFA date of June 12, 2024. We are rapidly advancing Tarlatamab into earlier lines of treatment, where we have initiated two Phase III studies and plan to initiate a third in the first half of 2024. Xaluritamig, a first-in-class STEAP1 bispecific molecule being studied in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer continues to progress following the presentation of encouraging Phase I data last fall. We are ahead of schedule with the monotherapy dose expansion and expect to complete enrollment in the coming weeks. We've opened a reduced monitoring cohort and are making significant progress in dose range finding studies in combination with novel hormonal therapy combinations. For AMG 193 in oral MTA cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor were encouraged by 9 responses we've seen across 7 MTAP-null solid tumors. MG 193 is a terrific example of a medicine targeting a genetically defined synthetic lethality and a first clinical translation of our induced proximity platform. We're now swiftly moving forward with dose expansion studies and plan to enter master protocols and thoracic and gastrointestinal malignancies, exploring combinations with standard of care in the first half of 2024. In our inflammation portfolio, we continue to explore TEZSPIRE and indications beyond severe asthma, including separate Phase III studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where top line data are expected in the second half of 2024 as well as in eosinophilic esophagitis. We also remain on track to present Phase II COPD data in the first half of 2024. Our ROCKET Phase III program for rocatinlimab, the first-in-class anti- OX40 -mon colonal antibody has successfully enrolled over 2,400 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. We're introducing an 8th study to the ROKET program to explore an auto-injector, and we are planning to initiate both the Phase III study in prurigo nodularis and a Phase II study in asthma this year as we seek to broadly explore the potential of rocatinlimab. Lastly, we are encouraged by the advancements of our rare disease pipeline with several mid to late-stage opportunities. In December, TEPEZZA received orphan drug designation in Japan where we've also recently submitted a new drug application for TEPEZZA in thyroid eye disease. To serve additional patients in Japan, we have a Phase III study underway in the study of chronic disease with a low clinical activity score. Beyond Japan, we are progressing TEPEZZA subcutaneous administration to drive increased adoption and improve patient experience and plan to initiate a Phase III study in thyroid eye disease this year. With UPLIZNA, we anticipate important Phase III data readouts this year in myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease. Both diseases with significant unmet need and where we have the potential to make a real difference for patients. Dazodalibep, an innovative CD40-ligand inhibitor fusion protein has entered Phase III for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. This follows encouraging Phase II data with efficacy across patients with moderate to severe systemic disease and patients with high symptom burden. Dazodalibep is the first therapy to demonstrate efficacy in this latter patient population. Closing on our rare disease efforts, we're excited about Fipaxalparant, an LPAR1 antagonist being studied in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, on track for a Phase II proof-of-concept data readout in the second half of 2024. In closing, I'm delighted to report on the important progress we make advancing our innovative pipeline, and I'm looking forward to sharing more pipeline milestones through 2024. I'll now turn it over to you, Peter. Peter Griffith : Thank you, Jay. We're pleased with our strong execution and performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2023. In the fourth quarter, total revenue of $8.2 billion grew 20% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS of $4.71 grew 15% year-over-year. For the full year, we delivered total revenue of $28.2 billion, 7% growth year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS of $18.65, 5% growth year-over-year. As a reminder, both Q4 and the full year results include Horizon's results beginning October 6 when the acquisition closed. So our financial results will exclude approximately 1 week of Horizon's results from our fourth quarter results. I'll review the details of our fourth quarter and full year financial results before discussing our outlook for 2024. The financial results are shown on Slides 54 to 56 of the slide deck. Turning to our fourth quarter's total revenue of $8.2 billion. We saw product sales increased 20% year-over-year, driven by volume growth of 23%, offset by net selling price decline of 3%. Excluding the impact of Horizon, product sales increased 5% year-over-year driven by volume growth of 9%. Full year total revenues of $28.2 billion grew 7% year-over-year. Product sales increased 9% year-over-year, driven by 15% volume growth. Other revenues decreased 16% year-over-year, primarily due to lower profit and cost sharing from our COVID-19 collaboration with Lilly in 2022. Strong expense discipline resulted in a 50% non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales for the full year 2023. While we continue to focus on both internal and external innovation, investing $4.7 billion in our pipeline and $27.8 billion in our acquisition of Horizon. With product sales volume growth at 23% in Q4 and 15% for the full year, we still efficiently manage the operating expenses of the business. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses increasing 18% year-over-year, while full year non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9%. Excluding the impact of Horizon, Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% and full year non-GAAP operating expenses increased 5%. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was flat on a year-over-year basis at 16.3%. For the full year, cost of sales as a percentage of product sales increased by 1.1 percentage points to 17.0%. The full year increase was primarily driven by higher profit share and changes in our product mix, partially offset by the replacement of the Puerto Rico excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the fourth quarter increased 16% year-over-year and 8% year-over-year for the full year primarily due to higher spend on later-stage clinical program and marketed product support, including spend on programs acquired from the Horizon acquisition and continuing investment in our pipeline, including MariTide. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 20% year-over-year, primarily driven by commercial and G&A expenses related to the Horizon acquisition. Full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by commercial and G&A expenses related to the Horizon acquisition, partially offset by a decline in other marketed product spend. Non-GAAP OI&E were about $635 million in expense in the fourth quarter, a $168 million increase year-over-year, primarily driven by increased interest expense related to the debt issued for the Horizon acquisition. Full year non-GAAP OI&E was favorable $279 million year-over-year, primarily driven by the change in accounting for the BeiGene investment to the fair value mark-to-market method and by gains related to early debt retirement, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Our non-GAAP tax rate increased 2.5 percentage points year-over-year to 15.9% in the fourth quarter and 2.7 percentage points year-over-year to 16.5% for the full year primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change mentioned previously. The company generated $7.4 billion of free cash flow in 2023 compared with $8.8 billion in 2022. The decrease is driven by the Horizon transaction and integration costs, higher repatriation tax payments and higher capital expenditures. We expect to continue to generate strong cash flows with the addition of Horizon and are on track with our deleveraging plans to return to our efficient capital structure by the end of 2025. In summary, we continue to execute on our multiple capital allocation priorities. First, we continue to prioritize investments in both internal and external innovation. Our increased spending in non-GAAP R&D of 8% in '23 over '22, coupled with the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, continues to broaden and strengthen our balanced portfolio across therapeutic areas. With our strong late-stage innovative pipeline moving forward through development, we expect our non-GAAP R&D to continue to increase in 2024. Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth, including our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. Amgen, Ohio, our new advanced assembly and final product packaging plant has just received license from the FDA for commercial production in January, roughly 2 years after we broke ground and our innovative drug substance plan under construction in North Carolina is expected to be operational by 2026. In addition, we've positioned the organization to accelerate investments in innovation, including leveraging the power of generative artificial intelligence. And third, we returned capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including $2.13 per share in the quarter. This represented a 10% increase over that paid in each of 2022 four [ph] quarters. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2024. First, because this is the first full year incorporating the impact of Horizon, we're providing some additional granularity in our guidance, which we don't expect to repeat to the same extent in the future. For 2024, we're expecting revenue of $32.4 billion to $33.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $18.90 to $20.30. As we continue to integrate Horizon, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in 2024, and we're on track to meet the synergies target previously communicated of at least $500 million in pretax cost by year 3 after closing or in 2026. Our revenue range reflects our strong growth outlook driven by numerous opportunities across our four therapeutic area pillars. We will record a full year of legacy Horizon product sales, and we expect continued volume-driven growth in our priority products Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, Prolia and BLINCYTO consistent with industry trends in our recent history, we expect mid single-digit price decline for our portfolio in 2024. As a reminder, as you model the first quarter of 2024 and consistent with our historical trends, we expect first quarter product sales to be the lowest quarter as a percentage of the full year due to benefit plan changes, insurance reverifications and increased co-pay charges. So we expect the first quarter of 2024 total revenue to grow roughly 20% year-over-year. For the full year, we expect other revenue to be in the range of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. And we continue to efficiently run the business through our disciplined approach to managing operating expenses. In 2024, we're making incremental R&D investments to support our promising late-stage pipeline, including our rapidly advancing oncology programs as discussed following ESMO in October and other programs, including MariTide. Furthermore, the addition of Horizon has an impact on the 2024 operating margin given the timing of when synergies are realized. As a result, we project the full year non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 48%. Note that we expect non-GAAP operating margin growth to accelerate in each of the quarters following the first quarter. There are primarily three reasons for this. First, typical lower product sales in Q1, as I mentioned above, and in each of the following quarters. Second, increased spend on our commercial brands will continue building on the investments we made in the second half of 2023, including Repatha, Otezla, and our bone portfolio of EVENITY and Prolia And third, Q1 2024 reflects the addition of Horizon, for which we are just at the beginning stages of realizing synergies given the acquisition close date of October 6. So we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be roughly 43% in the first quarter. I would reiterate that we expect operating margin growth to accelerate in each of the quarters following the first quarter. We project non-GAAP cost of sales to be in the range of 17% to 18% as a percentage of product sales for the 2024 year. Taking into account the full year of Horizon related expenses, we expect non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2024 to increase approximately 20% year-over-year with investments also increasing to advance key pipeline assets, including AMG 193, MariTide, rocatinlimab and tarlatamab. We see significant potential in our innovative pipeline, and it is important that we strategically invest now to fully unlock the opportunities ahead to create long-term value for patients, staff and shareholders. And for non-GAAP SG&A spend, we expect 2024 full year amounts as a percentage of product sales to be between 21% and 22%. We anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. As mentioned on our Q3 '23 call, the '24 guidance includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt rates for the Horizon acquisition. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 16% to 17%. Our guidance is primarily being driven by two factors. The first is the jurisdictional mix of income, including the full year benefits associated with the Horizon transaction and the legal entity rationalization undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2023 in part to integrate the Horizon entities into our existing U.S. headquartered legal entity structure. The second is the benefit from a planned payment to the IRS as an advanced deposit as we've done in the past to stop the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions. There is no change in our belief in the merits of our legal arguments with the IRS as we prepare for trial. Given the interest rate environment, although the deposit negatively affects our cash flow in '24, if any of the deposit is returned to us upon the resolution of our litigation, those funds would accrue interest income. Therefore, the makes this payment makes this payment a prudent use of our capital. Once again, out of an abundance of clarity, this represents no change in our belief in the merits of the tax court case. The guidance also includes the impact of the adoption of the OECD 15% minimum tax by certain jurisdictions. Based on our individual footprint, we don't anticipate any significant effects of the new rules in 2024, but we're closely watching the global tax landscape for future impacts as the framework continues to be considered by additional jurisdictions and new rules take effect. We expect governments around the world, including the United States to continue to look for more sources of tax revenue from large multinational corporations that could result in higher taxes in the coming years. Similar to 2023, we expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2024 we expect that we will continue to increase our dividend. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion in 2024, consistent with our capital allocation priority to invest in our business, including the Ohio and North Carolina facilities I mentioned ahead and into the rare disease pillar. In summary, we delivered another strong year of financial results in 2023. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen is strong, and we believe that our new rare disease pillar, one of our four pillars will be an important additive source of growth for the company. This concludes the financial update. My thanks to my approximately 27,000 plus colleagues at Amgen around the world for their commitment to our mission of serving patients and their tireless efforts in 2023. I'll turn it back to Bob for Q&A. Robert Bradway : Okay. Thank you. Let's open the line, and we'll take questions from our callers. And Julian, why don't you remind them of the procedures so we can get through these questions here efficiently for everyone. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Yee : Hey, guys. Good afternoon, and thanks for good results and good guidance. We had a question on obesity. On 133, of course, you had the publication yesterday I feel like it was the most scrutinized Phase 1 publication. But maybe you could just talk to - maybe Jay could talk to your interpretation of some of the markers, for example, lipids, A1C, blood pressure and all that kind of thing. And maybe talk about your confidence about the profile versus competitors? Thank you so much. Jay Bradner : Yes. Thanks a lot, Michael. We really appreciate the consideration the Phase 1 paper is receiving from the community. It's exciting to report these data. For those who haven't seen it, this was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 49 patients, looking at safety, PK, PD, single ascending dose, 7 cohorts, multiple ascending dose 3 cohorts, 3 monthly doses, patients with obesity being migrated than 30. And we were quite pleased with the outcome. Looking at the 420-milligram dose as an example, which was the highest dose study, 14.5% weight loss at only day 85. And moreover, quite durable coming off of that medicine out to 150 days, all with relatively mild gastrointestinal side effects. And so to answer your last question first, we find the Phase I data, which we're pleased to share with the community to be quite supportive of our ongoing work to develop this medicine to the greatest possible benefit of patients suffering from obesity. Now you've asked questions around some of the measurements on this study, lipid, blood pressure and A1C. And I would just caution that this is a Phase I trial, the numbers are very small, that the duration of treatment is rather short. But even with all of those caveats, while hard to draw conclusions from such small numbers, especially labile measurements like blood pressure and lipids, all are directionally favorable. And so we have - we take no concern whatsoever from those measurements on the study. Michael Yee : Okay. Thank you. Those are the questions. Yeah. Operator : Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line open. Salveen Richter : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Another one here on the obesity program. So post the published Phase I data, how are you thinking about differentiation on GI tolerability? Is the dose range being evaluated in the Phase II study similar to that in the Phase I? Thank you. Jay Bradner : Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take this one as well. As you may or may not know, the Phase II study, which is ongoing at present and going very well, explores 11 dosing cohorts with relevant placebo controls. And through that study, we'll have a chance to gain an experience with a longer exposure to MariTide dosed in different ways. We've recently added a part 2 to this study that will allow us to explore even more durable weight loss beyond 52 weeks enabled by just very rapid enrollment. And these four dosing cohorts will go on to test dose level and even less frequent dosing schedules than monthly. And so these Phase II data, even by end of year will be strongly instructive as to finding a safe and tolerated and efficacious dose to carry into Phase III clinical investigation. Robert Bradway : Yes. The only thing I would add is we're starting from a basis of a monthly dosing cadence and schedule. And so the additional dosing cohorts would look at potential dosing schedule beyond monthly. And the data are pretty clear in the market right now that the GI toxicity or GI side effects are generally related to the day of dosing of the GLP-1s, which are dosed weekly. We see some of that same GI side effect profile in kind of the first dose part of the dose titration. But there's an opportunity here to potentially spread the dosing intervals out further and further improve tolerability in our program. And as Jay clearly described, we've got all of the different aspects of that being studied in the Phase II program. Justin Claeys : Thanks, Julianne. We'll go to the next question. Operator : Thank you, Salveen. Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jay Olson : Hey, thank you so much for taking a question, and congrats on the progress. Another question on 133. Talk about whether or not that we see later this year will include patients from two of the study? And do you think it's possible that 133 could be dosed twice every 2 or 3 months? And also, if you could just comment on the rollover rate of patients from Part 1 to Part 2? Thank you. Robert Bradway : Jay, could you catch all that some of what Jay asked was broken up at the beginning... Jay Bradner : The third part was a little bit broken up of your question. I heard a better explanation of part two frequency of dosing. And then I did not hear your third part. Jay Olson : If you just comment on the rate of patients rolling over from Part 1 to Part 2? Thanks. Jay Bradner : Okay. Yes. Thank you for the question, Jay. Let me give a little bit of context on this Part 2 study that I think will help answer them. In part 2, the intent is to really look at durable weight loss beyond 52 weeks. And so by durable weight loss, patients eligible for Part 2, which begins at the end of 52 weeks, will be responding to this medicine. And then they'll be rerandomized to four cohorts that will test dose level. And again, this even less frequent dosing schedule. We have not disclosed the granularity on the dosing schedule. This is a competitive environment. But we're afforded this chance because the ADC, the antibody core of MariTide, like so many immunoglobulin therapeutics allows for the opportunity to use it much less frequently. The rate of patients rolling over to Part 2 will be established as the Phase II study continues to progress this year. Justin Claeys : Thank you, Julianne. Next question. Operator : Thank you, Jay. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks very much. Just maybe to pivot over to TEPEZZA [ph] for a question. Can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics for 2024? It seems like the products come back to growth. But I'm just trying to get a sense of now that Amgen owns the asset and has more kind of time with it. What are your top priorities? And how do you think about continuing to kind of grow the new patient base here? Thank you. Robert Bradway : Sure, Chris. Maybe we'll take it in a couple of parts. But Vikram, share your thoughts first. Vikram Karnani : Yes. Thank you for the question. I think if you focus a little bit on what are the underlying factors that are driving TEPEZZA growth, we saw a record number of unique TEPEZZA prescribers. We saw an increase in patient enrollment forms and patient starts. In addition, we've made pretty significant progress on payer coverage, as we've seen our covered lives have now increased to greater than 50% of U.S. covered lives. And that's important, educating some of those stakeholders on the new clinical data updated indication, it continues to drive uptake across the full spectrum of TED patients. And finally, what holds all of this together is a really robust patient service model that supports patient access. I think we continue to make progress and execute towards each one of these important leading indicators. And we shouldn't forget that we - there is still low penetration of the approximately 100,000 patients that can be eligible for this medicine in the U.S. alone. Now, just one last point here is that as we've noted before, there continues to be a time lag between the execution of all of these efforts and the realization of increased patient numbers. As we said before, it can take up to 90 days once a patient is identified for therapy for that patient to actually get on therapy. But we're pretty happy with all of our leading indicators and the execution that we have seen coming out of last year. Robert Bradway : And Chris, the only thing I would add is building on what Vikram said in his prepared remarks, we're excited about the international opportunity as well, and I think he characterized that well previously. And we're also excited about what we see as ongoing opportunities to invest in innovation for the benefit of TED patients. So all in all, I feel excited about the rare disease pillar that we've established and the role that TEPEZZA will play in that. Justin Claeys : All right. Next question, Julianne? Operator : Thank you, Chris. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to touch on TEZSPIRE specifically in COPD. How are you planning to differentiate given the pretty competitive data we saw from Dupixent [ph] And how should investors be looking at this data from an efficacy bar? Are there nuances in this trial that need to be clarified that might make it harder to do an apples-to-apples comparison? Robert Bradway : Yes, and thanks for the question. Murdo, why don't I start and then you add on. So it's a great and timely question. The Phase II COPD study of TEZSPIRE, we expect data in the first half of this year. This was a big study, 337 patients, moderate to severe COPD. They're having exacerbations despite being on triple therapy. And so reflective of the current unmet need inadequacy of therapy for patients with COPD. This is a slightly broader population than Dupi that we're studying here. We're totally on track for the readout. We quite like the mechanism here. You must know that TSLP [j works as a signaling factor upstream and by blocking it with our unique biotherapeutic, we block TSLP IL-25, IL-33 signaling. TSLP so many cell types modulating this airway Type 2 response. By hitting TSLP upstream, we think we can really have an impact on the disease biology. We see TSLP-elevated in the serum patients in bronchial mucosa [PH] and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. It's released by airway epithelium. There's just a lot of signals from the basic biology of this disease pointing to a medicine of this nature. And by looking at the broader population than they did with Dupi, we have a chance to really figure out who the responder is. Murdo? Murdo Gordon : I think you've covered all the bases. I would just add this, Evan, that with the unique and differentiated mechanism, as Jay described, we hope we can treat a broader population of patients than perhaps the currently available therapies. And we also recognize that there are patients who are refractory to those currently available therapies, and we would obviously want to understand if they would be responders to TEZSPIRE. I think we've got strong commercial capabilities, including with our partners at AstraZeneca and are well positioned to take a product like this into the market if we're successful in Phase III. Justin Claeys : Okay. All right. Thank you, Julian. Next question? Operator : Thank you, Evan. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch up on AMG 133 as well, two parts question. First, on the discontinuations at the high dose, we know five out of eight did not finish the full duration of the study, but there was a second arm also of this high dose 420-milligram with 10 patients, which was not reported. This was the one with digital tools. Could you speak to the discontinuation rate in that arm? So this a 420 done separately, which is not part of paper? And secondly, I know there's a case of liver enzyme elevation of the 280-meg dose, but this patient also had COVID. Could you perhaps speak to the timing of liver enzyme elevation relative to the COVID episode? Thank you very much. Robert Bradway : Yes. Thanks, Umer. I won't be able to provide patient level insights to the Phase I study at this time, but I do appreciate your question and your interest in the report. I'll speak to the dropouts of the Phase 1 at the 420-milligram dose, which was four out of the eight patients. First, it's notable to say that the high-dose cohort in the multiple ascending dose receiving the three doses of 420 experienced real weight loss, real benefit of 14.5% after these three monthly doses. This was the group that proved actually quite durable out to day 150. Four subjects decline to participate in this clinical study setting largely from logistical reasons. The AEs and other characteristics were comparable to all the other patients in the study. Now the second question around the digital group, I don't have insight into that. Dave, do you... David Reese : No. I mean we can get back to you on that. I don't know that we reported that - those data and the discontinuation rate. Justin Claeys : Julianne, next question. Operator : Thank you, Umer. Our next question comes from Colin Bristow from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Colin Bristow : Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe a couple more on MariTide. First, could you provide some insight into the dosing? I mean, obviously, these are pretty large doses. And if we look at like Repatha for 20 milligrams takes over 5 minutes by infusion or 3 infective injections. So I was wondering if you could give any insight there. And then in terms of the relative affinity for gip versus GLIP [ph] MariTide seams to have preferentially favor GLIP much more than competitor molecules. And so do you think the ultimate clinical profile is more closely going to resemble that of a long-acting glip-1 versus competitive git GLIPS [ph]? Thanks. Robert Bradway : Yes. Thanks, Colin. I appreciate the deep consideration of the molecule, especially. I'd start by saying, I don't regard these doses as high. I'm new here, but 420 milligrams for biotherapeutic that's an antibody drug conjugate with a peptide antibody ratio 2 :1 seems well in scope for a modern biotherapeutic product. I don't need to tell this community paying so close - such close attention to Amgen that this is a very sophisticated biotherapeutics organization. And on the manufacturing side, just every patient, every time. And we have all the capabilities necessary to deliver this medicine at whichever of these three or other dose and schedule we arrived at. So no concerns there for me whatsoever. Regarding the balance of the pharmacology, you do invoke a difference between our medicine and medicines developed by pure pharmaceutical companies. Namely mechanistically the core antibody of MariTide inhibits the GIP receptor, whereas these other peptide medicines agonize it. We feel very secure in our choice to inhibit that receptor supported by just the finest level of experimental data available experiments of nature that genome-wide association studies in very large populations have pointed to a need, an opportunity to inhibit the gift receptor to deliver lower BMI as observed with variance in that receptor and downstream signaling pathways that correlate with reduced body mass index in large populations. As to the balance, which you asked, between inhibition of GIP receptor and agonism of GLP-1, these are very difficult measurements to make in humans, but our modeling suggests that with the therapeutic doses and exposures that we observe that we're achieving both. Murdo Gordon : And Colin, this is Murdo. I would just add that from a patient experience perspective, we've learned a lot from other biologics. And Amgen has a world-class process development, manufacturing and device team, and we've done a lot of work on this one, and we anticipate a very positive and simple patient experience on at least a monthly dosing schedule. And we've learned a lot from Repatha specifically, and there's more to follow on Repatha from that, but we continue to work to improve patient experience with our biologic injectables. Jay Bradner : Just as we go to the next question, let me observe that we're almost up to the hour that we actually all to set aside, but I know we still have quite a few questions in the queue. So we'll try to get one question for a caller here and get through. We'll stay through the queue of calls or questions rather that's still waiting for us, but I know some of you may have to drop. So let's move forward, Justin. Justin Claeys : Julianne. Next question please. Operator : Thank you, Collin. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : All right. Great, thanks. This is Brendan on for Yaron. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one from us. Actually, based on the data you've seen so far and maybe some feedback from physicians that you've heard, this is on UPLIZNA. Where do you kind of see UPLIZNA fitting into maybe the MG treatment paradigm given all the competition there, but maybe more to the point, how you're thinking about expansion opportunities given all the different autoimmune indications you could potentially pursue? Just trying to kind of understand how you see longer-term growth there? Robert Bradway : First, why don't we ask Vikram, just to address the performance of the product right now in NMOSD. And then a combination of Jay and Dave can talk about the other activities or other potential applications. Vikram Karnani : Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, UPLIZNA is actually growing quite nicely and quite well in NMOSD. As you know, it is now the fastest-growing biologic in NMOSD. We continue to execute across a variety of fronts. I mean, we're - we see this product nicely positioned versus as it's appropriate for NMOSD patients and within the competitive environment that we operate in. We've continued to make significant progress over the last 18 months or so, maybe even longer of continuing to drive more growth with newer prescribers and even depth with existing prescribers. So the product continues to do well. And I think we hope to continue to deliver good execution on this medicine in NMOSD. Maybe, Jay, you want to talk about the second question? Jay Bradner : Yes. No, I'm happy to. As you may know, on a hematologist, I think CD19 is a terrific target. It's expressed really on all B cells and spares plasma cells. And therefore, considering indication expansion, as you've asked, there's a large number of diseases that could potentially be approached with UPLIZNA to the real benefit of patients with unmet need, far beyond the application of the prevailing CD20s that target just a subset of B cells. This is not lost on our team, and we're working through indication expansion priorities presently. Justin Claeys : Julian, let\u2019s got the next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. I have a question regarding the subcutaneous delivery of TEPEZZA. You do have a plan to initiate a Phase III study. Can you talk a little bit about which technology you are using? Is this with the pre-existing Halozyme technology? Or are you using something else for this development? Thank you. Robert Bradway : Sorry, I had trouble understanding your question. Murdo Gordon : The question is what technology we're using for the subcutaneous injectable form of TEPEZZA? Robert Bradway : Maybe I'll jump in. Mohit, we're not commenting at this point on the provider. We just said that we're going forward with the subcu. Justin Claeys : Okay, Julian, we\u2019ll go to next question. Operator : Thank you, Mohit. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open Geoff Meacham : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Another one on 133. When you think about the Phase III program, I just wanted to know what sort of informs the next indications you're going to go after? Is it unmet need? Is it the potential for differentiation on 133 and the timing of that, do you think that you'd want to have the Phase II data in hand? Or is this something that you could roll out sort of that risk? Thank you. Robert Bradway : Yes. Thanks for the question, Geoff, really appreciate it. As you know, obesity is a major public health crisis, maybe 40% of Americans with a BMI over 30 massively costly. So a huge burden to the global third-party payers and societies. The obesity-related disease list is quite long and expanding from cardiovascular disease and heart failure, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, NASH and AFLD kidney disease. These are chronic conditions that really demand medicines that can deliver durable and chronic weight loss. And so we think we have a really strong offering for these obesity-related diseases rising in our Phase II program, as you know. And obesity has a strong genetic component and we locked on to gipper [ph] inhibition based on genetic insights. So the opportunity space is quite large. You asked the question what indications and perhaps even in what sequence. And when we have all the requisite data, we'll remark in due course. But we intend all indications where this dual mechanism can improve public health. And we are actively planning and on track for an expansive Phase III program. Jay Bradner : And in terms of - Dave, you want to add the regulatory piece? David Reese : Yes, I think -- Geoff, this is Dave Reese. I would just add that we're planning a very expansive Phase III program. So you can expect to see multiple indications move forward in parallel. And as Jay indicated, as we start to see data, we will begin launching those trials, and we'll discuss them. And then in addition, as you're aware, regulatory authorities around the world require a certain body of safety data before Phase III launches. And so of course, we will be compliant with that. But our goal is to launch Phase III as quickly as possible once we have the requisite data set and regulatory approval. Justin Claeys : Great. All right. Julian, we'll go to the next question, please. Operator : Thank you, Geoff. Our next question comes from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much. So I have another question on AMG 133, please. Could you add some more color on your expectations for the impact on blood pressure and lipids in Phase II, specifically whether you anticipate tirzepatide-like efficacy on those metrics? Thanks very much. Robert Bradway : Yes. Thanks, David. I mean we're making all these measurements, and I'm not going to try to forecast the outcome of that pharmacology at this time. As you've seen in our Phase I program, the medicines very well tolerated, delivering durable weight loss and benefit without significant excursion of some of those measurements. I just think it's too early to try to answer your question, and we'll have all that data at the end of the first part of Phase II towards the end of this calendar year. Jay Bradner : And the best extrapolation that you can have is from the preclinical data that were just published, I urge you to take a look at that. Justin Claeys : Okay. Julian, we\u2019ll go to next question, please. Operator : Thank you, David. Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : It's Ege [ph] on for Michael. Thanks for taking our question. A quick one on [indiscernible] Can you talk about your plan of data disclosure this year and your current thinking on the potential registration path? How do you think about the positioning of this agent relative to some of the other emerging agents based on different mechanisms such as ADC or AR degradors in prostate cancer? Thank you. Robert Bradway : Yes. Thanks for this outstanding question, Michael. And Zalaritamag [ph] is a very interesting and exciting molecule for those on the call. This is a steep on CD3 bispecific. We have been studying this in advance castrate-resistant prostate cancer. We have expanded a cohort in the Phase I monotherapy. We're opening to reduce monitoring as well as - as you invoke the existing and novel androgen receptor modulators integrators, we're exploring combinations with novel agents in that domain as well. The priorities for the program right now are to establish reduced monitoring. This will be important to reach just all the patients who can benefit. We're looking at the feasibility of reduced monitoring. We have a great experience with these T-cell engaging bispecifics as well as the plausibility of outpatient therapy. The approach to the regulatory path will present in due course. There'll be no surprises there. The path to bring medicines to patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer alone and ultimately, in combination is well worn, thankfully, and we know how to deliver there. You asked about differentiation in other medicines. These are often apples to oranges comparisons. We have looked at that, of course, and we really like the offering of Zalaritamag. The patients treated on our study had quite advanced disease, even more advanced disease than the demographics of the patients as reported on other mechanism medicines such as radio ligand therapies.. And the response rates we're seeing are really clinically meaningful to patients. And that gives us great encouragement to develop the medicine more ambitiously in the next few years. Murdo Gordon : Jay, in terms of the data sharing, do you want to share... David Reese : For data availability - as Jay mentioned, we're nearly complete in terms of dose expansion enrollment. So as those data roll forward over the course of the year, we'll provide guidance as to when we might have the next look at that data. But that's probably the next meaningful set of data we'll get a look at either later this year or early into next year. Justin Claeys : Julianne, next question, please. Operator : Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tim Anderson : Thank you very much. So Eli Lilly today made a couple of sets of comments about this topic of GIP agonism versus antagonism and they also weighed in on the data you published yesterday. And I'm wondering, in as much as you heard that or read those comments, is there any context to add or anything that's factually incorrect or anything to refute because they covered quite a few points, and they continue to express their view, which is agonism is the best way not antagonism? Jay Bradner : Tim, this is Jay. I open it up to anyone else who wants to contribute to this. I don't believe that - yes, that engaging in the dialogue around this is as much to the narrative. Rather, I'd say that the argument for GIP receptor antagonism comes from just the highest level of scientific data, the human experience across populations with 1 million patients studied, among those who have variations in the genes associated with this pathway where that variation is directionally inhibitory, the BMI is lower. And so we're hoping to replicate that pharmacology with this medicine. We feel great about the offering in this domain. Justin Claeys : Okay. Julianne, next question, please. Operator : Thank you, Tim. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. This is Nicole on for Robin. So on Daxdilimab, targeting ILT7 business, can you talk about your level of confidence in this target in light of the competitive landscape? And would you expect to see near term from safety and efficacy? Robert Bradway : Sure. Jay and Dave? Jay Bradner : Yes. Well, it's very early days with this medicine. There is strong preclinical support from the published literature and our own preclinical work. It's nicely for patients, a very competitive landscape, but this is the earliest phases of clinical investigation. And so we're going to approach this with total aquapoise and bring the medicine to the patients that stand to benefit the best based on the biology underlying. David Reese : Yes. I would say the target, as you mentioned, is one that helps control some of the central signaling that drives some of the autoimmune diseases that are being investigated here. And at this point, I think it's all efforts towards generating the clinical data. Justin Claeys : Okay. Jullian, next question please. Operator : Thank you, Nicole. Our next question comes from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open James Shin : Thanks for taking our question. I have one for Jay. I just kind of want to piggyback on what Tim was alluding to. The GIP antagonism versus agonism, I'm looking at the Nature paper, it looks like 133 420-milligram dose has a slight blip in triglycerides that eventually fades, but it does seem like antagonism is behaving a little differently from the literature for agonism. Is it too early to chalk it up to antagonism versus agonism in your view? Just wanted to get your thoughts there. Jay Bradner : The short answer is it's too early to talk it up to antagonism versus agonism. As I said before, and I meant it, that these lipids are labile and indirect biomarker of this pharmacology. This is an early stage study that had 1 or 3 monthly doses of the medicine. And so we are not reading anything into the lipids conclusively from this trial. We are making all these measurements in the active Phase I. Justin Claeys : Great. Then I think we have time for one more, Julianne. Operator : Thank you, James. Our last question will come from Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Carter Gould : Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just one on 786. Can you walk through exactly what's sort of driving - maybe let me take it back. Maybe first kind of if you could outline sort of how you're setting expectations there? And any color on what's driving the delay there? It seems like it's taking a long time to enroll 72 patients? Thank you. Robert Bradway : Sure. No, thank you for your question. For the broader group, AMG 786 is an oral medicine being developed for obesity. It is not an increasing that we've not as yet disclosed this target or pathway. This study is progressing fine. The readout of the Phase I is on track for the first half of 2024. We've completed initial dose escalation cohorts, and we're just collecting and analyzing data, expecting the readout in the first half of this year. Justin Claeys : And Julianne, we're going to turn it back to Bob for some closing remarks. Robert Bradway : Okay. Thank you all for joining the call. As you heard, we're excited about the opportunities that we see for growing our business across all four of our pillars, general medicine oncology, inflammation in rare disease. Last October, we shared an in-depth look at oncology in connection with the ESMO medical meeting. And we plan to do an introductory review of rare diseases and our rare disease pillar in late February to give you more information about the medicines that we already have on the market as well as some of those that are advancing through our pipeline. So we're encouraged by the questions that we heard on this call about those molecules, and we're excited about them and their prospects. So we'll host a call, which IR will share with you here over the next few days and look forward to having that opportunity. In the meantime, again, thank you for your support, and we look forward to talking to you at the Rare Disease Day at our first quarter results call. Thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : My name is Julianne, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Justin Claeys, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Claeys, you may now begin. Justin Claeys : Thank you, Julianne. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Jay Bradner, Murdo Gordon, Vikram Karnani and Peter Griffith. Through the course of our discussion today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and have provided appropriate reconciliations within the materials that accompany this call. We will also make some forward-looking statements, which are qualified by our safe harbor statement. And please note that actual results can vary materially. Over to you, Bob. Robert Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Justin, and thank you to our callers for joining us today. This is a busy and exciting time here at Amgen. And as you can see from our results, we're reaching many more patients around the world with our existing medicines, advancing a broad range of potential first-in-class medicines in our mid- and late-stage pipeline, and redefining what's possible in research as we integrate wet and dry lab capabilities and harness transformative technologies. I'll touch on a few highlights from the quarter that give me great confidence that we're on a path to deliver attractive long-term growth. First, we have a number of products across general medicine, oncology and inflammation that have strong momentum and still plenty of room to grow. These include Repatha, which was up 33%; EVENITY, up 35%; BLINCYTO, up 26%; and TEZSPIRE, up 80%. With BLINCYTO, we expect an approval in June that should accelerate our efforts to integrate into earlier treatment lines for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With TEZSPIRE, we'll share data later this month that reflect the attractive potential of this medicine in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. COPD is the world's third leading cause of death. Clearly, new treatments are very much needed, and we're excited by TEZSPIRE's potential to make a difference there. Second, our newest pillar of growth, rare disease, contributed nearly $1 billion of sales in the quarter, up 14% compared with the sales of these products from a year ago. We see significant upside potential for first-in-class early-life cycle medicines like TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA, UPLIZNA and TAVNEOS. And we're pursuing launches in new geographic markets, new indications and/or new formulations for each. As an example, we announced last week our imminent plans to file TEPEZZA for approval in the European Union. Overall, the integration of Horizon, its people, products and pipeline is proceeding well, reflecting the strong fit between our organizations. Third, we are rapidly advancing a number of promising new medicines in our mid- and late-stage pipeline, spanning all 4 of our therapeutic areas. We are awaiting approval for tarlatamab, for example, and look forward to bringing this transformative innovation to patients with small cell lung cancer. Tarlatamab is the first T-cell-engaging therapy to demonstrate significant clinical activity against a common solid tumor, a watershed moment in a field that Amgen pioneered and continues to lead. Looking to the rest of the year, we anticipate data readouts from 5 Phase III trials. In addition, we announced today the development of a biosimilar to KEYTRUDA as we look to build upon the global leadership we have established in biosimilars. In sum, we have a broad range of medicines in hand today and coming through our pipeline that will enable us to meet the needs of millions of patients around the world and deliver strong growth through the end of the decade and beyond. Now let me just add one other important update. Whereas we don't normally comment on interim data, especially for our Phase II trial, we recognize there is significant interest in obesity in MariTide, so we'll provide additional commentary today. The interim Phase II analysis for this study is complete, and we are very encouraged with the results that we've seen thus far and with the conduct of the trial. Following the interim analysis, I would say we're confident in MariTide's differentiated profile and believe it will address important unmet medical needs. We are actively planning a broad Phase III program including obesity, obesity-related conditions and diabetes. Obviously, we expect to carefully complete our ongoing Phase II trial before then moving as swiftly as appropriate to establish the safety and efficacy of this potential medicine in Phase III trials. We've initiated activities as well to further expand manufacturing capacity with both clinical and commercial supply in mind. Jay will provide a few additional remarks with respect to this ongoing study. And I would ask you to recognize that to protect the integrity of the study beyond this update, we would not expect to discuss these data in further detail before completion. As always, I want to thank our employees around the world for their commitment to our business and to the patients we serve. Jay, I'll turn it over to you. James Bradner : Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with MariTide. Reiterating Bob's comments, we are very pleased with the results seen with MariTide thus far.  And we're very pleased with the overall conduct of the ongoing Phase II trial. All arms remain active, patient dropout has not been an issue, and we're fully on track for top line 52-week data from this 11-arm Phase II study in late 2024. We're seeing a differentiated profile of MariTide and are confident that it will address important unmet medical needs, obesity, obesity-related conditions and diabetes. We look forward to completing the ongoing Phase II study and working with regulators to move rapidly to the broad Phase III program. Later this year, we plan to initiate an additional dedicated Phase II trial investigating MariTide for the treatment of diabetes in patients with and without obesity. This new trial is not a gating step for our Phase III program in patients with obesity. Informed by dose and schedule insights from the ongoing Phase II obesity study, the dedicated Phase II study in diabetes conforms to regulatory requirements for Phase III and is the next step towards a diabetes indication for MariTide. In terms of patient experience, we expect to deliver MariTide in a convenient, handheld, patient-friendly auto-injector device with a monthly or even less frequent single-injection administration, assuming eventual approval. Across the portfolio, we are presently prioritizing differentiated medicines, those that stand to provide the greatest benefit for patients. Given the profile we've seen with AMG 786, we will not pursue further development. Instead, in obesity, we're differentially investing in MariTide and a number of preclinical assets. Beyond MariTide, in the first quarter, we rapidly advanced our diverse clinical pipeline of potentially first-in-class or best-in-class programs. Looking ahead, the remainder of 2024 promises to be an exciting time for research and development with 2 PDUFA dates in June for tarlatamab in small cell lung cancer and BLINCYTO in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia as well as 5 Phase III data readouts. Each of these milestones could represent a significant advance towards our mission to deliver groundbreaking treatments to patients in real need. Moving to olpasiran. We're pleased to announce that we've completed enrollment of the OCEAN(a)-Outcomes trial, a Phase III cardiovascular outcome study of olpasiran, our potentially best-in-class Lp(a)-targeting small interfering RNA medicine. Reflecting both our commitment to patients suffering from cardiovascular disease and the strong interest of the medical community, we successfully enrolled 7,297 patients across the globe in just 15.5 months. To our knowledge, this is the fastest-enrolling Phase III outcome study of its size. And to remind, Lp(a) is a genetically defined cardiovascular risk factor, which is elevated in approximately 20% of individuals and for whom no effective or targeted therapies currently exist. In oncology, we continue to deliver on high-conviction targets with differentiated therapies capable of delivering a large effect size for patients. Starting with tarlatamab, a first-in-class BiTE molecule targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. We remain on track with an FDA priority review for a June 12 PDUFA date. We're excited about tarlatamab as potentially the first selective therapy for small cell lung cancer. Based on the remarkable activity observed as a single agent in patients receiving second and third-line therapy, we are rapidly advancing tarlatamab in a frontline treatment with 3 Phase III studies now initiated in both extensive stage and limited stage disease. The rationale for studying tarlatamab in earlier lines of the context of lower tumor burden draws from our experience with BLINCYTO in B-cell ALL. There, we saw a dramatic improvement in overall survival in minimal residual disease-negative patients. These BLINCYTO data provide evidence that directing the T-cell in this manner is an effective means of finding and eliminating residual cancer cells, which are primarily the drivers of recurrent disease. We're hopeful we can build on this insight with tarlatamab, where comparable activity in early-stage small cell lung cancer patients would very meaningfully improve outcomes for patients facing the challenge of this aggressive cancer. In sum, we regard tarlatamab as a major advance as the first bispecific T-cell engager to demonstrate efficacy in a common solid tumor, further establishing the broad potential of our bispecific T-cell engager platform. Our first-in-class STEAP1 CD3 bispecific molecule, xaluritamig, has also demonstrated unambiguous activity in the solid tumor, namely prostate cancer, continues to advance following a presentation of encouraging Phase I data last fall. We have now fully enrolled the monotherapy Phase I dose expansion and continue to enroll patients in reduced monitoring and outpatient cohorts. Further, combination studies with xaluritamig in novel hormonal therapies are progressing in dose escalation studies with near-term plans to initiate dose expansion cohorts. To round out oncology, we are rapidly advancing AMG 193, our oral PRMT5 inhibitor targeting MTAP null solid tumors. We've moved forward with monotherapy dose expansion studies and have initiated 2 additional Phase I studies targeting MTAP null tumors in thoracic, gastrointestinal, biliary tract and pancreatic cancers, exploring relevant combinations with standard of care. In our inflammation portfolio, we are encouraged by the results of the COURSE Phase IIa proof-of-concept study, which investigated TEZSPIRE in patients with moderate to very severe COPD. This study was designed to test TSLP inhibition across an intentionally broad range of eosinophil levels, irrespective of inflammatory drivers, emphysema, chronic bronchitis and smoking status. While TEZSPIRE achieved a clinically meaningful 17% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations compared to placebo, this result fell short of statistical significance likely owing to the broad overall patient demographic. However, even greater reductions in COPD exacerbations were observed in a planned subgroup of patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts greater than 150 cells per microliter with a trend for further reduction in a small number of subjects with baseline counts greater than 300. We're excited by these data, which will be presented in an oral session of the American Thoracic Society Annual Meeting later this month. Together with our partner, AstraZeneca, we are actively planning for Phase III development of TEZSPIRE in COPD. Beyond COPD, we continue to explore TEZSPIRE in separate Phase III studies in eosinophilic esophagitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where top line data are expected in the second half of this year. The ROCKET Phase III program for rocatinlimab, a first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody, has successfully enrolled over 2,800 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Indeed, 3 of the 8 studies in the rocatinlimab ROCKET study program are now fully enrolled. The Phase III Horizon study, part of this ROCKET program, evaluates rocatinlimab monotherapy versus placebo in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and remains on track for top line data readout in the second half of this year. Beyond atopic dermatitis, we continue to broadly explore rocatinlimab in additional indications and have initiated a Phase II study in moderate to severe asthma with plans to initiate a Phase III study in prurigo nodularis in the second half of this year. We're encouraged by the advancements of our rare disease pipeline as well with several mid- to late-stage opportunities. Starting with UPLIZNA, we anticipate important Phase III data readouts this year in myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease, both diseases with significant unmet need and where we have the potential to make a real difference for patients. Dazodalibep, an innovative CD40 ligand inhibitor fusion protein, has entered Phase III for Sjogren's disease with 2 studies now enrolling patients. This follows encouraging Phase II data with efficacy across patients with moderate to severe systemic disease and patients with high symptom burden. Dazodalibep is the first therapy to demonstrate efficacy in the latter patient population. Lastly, in our biosimilars portfolio, we've initiated a Phase III study of ABP 234, a biosimilar candidate to KEYTRUDA, in subjects with advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We're also pleased to announce that WEZLANA, our biosimilar candidate to STELARA, has received a positive CHMP opinion. In closing, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for their strong sense of service to patients facing serious illness and their commitment to growing the impact of both our research and our business to our portfolio of potential first-in-class and best-in-class medicines. And I'll now turn it over to Murdo. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Jay. I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Strong execution resulted in sales growth of 22% year-over-year, with robust volume growth across the 4 therapeutic pillars of our business. We drove compelling growth across our regions with 10 products delivering at least double-digit volume growth, including Repatha, EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, TAVNEOS and BLINCYTO. Our integration of the legacy Horizon business continues to progress well with that portfolio generating $914 million in the quarter. Sales in our general medicines business, including Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY and Aimovig grew 18% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by volume growth. Repatha sales increased 33% year-over-year to a record of $517 million for the first quarter, and Repatha is now well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar business. In the quarter, we saw year-over-year volume growth of 44%, partially offset with 13% lower net selling price. Expanded formulary coverage for Repatha in the U.S. has accelerated volume growth. This was partially offset by lower net selling price resulting from higher rebates to support and expand access for patients. We expect this expanded formulary coverage, along with the removal of prior authorization requirements by several payers, will lead to increased cardiologist and primary care physician adoption. Outside the U.S., we also delivered strong growth, helping even more patients reduce their cardiovascular risk. EVENITY had record sales of $342 million for the quarter. And in the U.S., volume growth was supported by an expansion of EVENITY prescribers. In Japan, EVENITY continues to be the segment leader with 46% of the bone builder market. And while we're happy with the growth of EVENITY, there are many women who remain at risk of a fracture due to their postmenopausal osteoporosis. And we see exciting growth potential for EVENITY to combat this risk, and we'll continue to apply our proven experience in bone health to ensure EVENITY reaches all the patients who need it. Prolia sales grew 8% year-over-year. Volume growth continues to be supported by real-world evidence, reaffirming Prolia's superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis, who are at high risk of fracture. In our inflammation business, Otezla sales increased 1% year-over-year for the first quarter. In the U.S., we saw strong new patient volume growth early in the quarter. This was disrupted in February and March by the Change Healthcare cybersecurity issue, which created challenges for some patients trying to fill prescriptions at specialty pharmacies. We've seen a return to accelerating new patient prescription growth in recent weeks. We see significant potential for future growth of Otezla, given its established efficacy and safety profile, excellent payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and, of course, ease of administration. To realize this potential, we've increased our investment in dermatology field force and Otezla direct-to-consumer media, focusing on efforts to educate physicians and patients on the importance of treating psoriasis systemically and the safety and efficacy profile of Otezla. I'm also pleased that Otezla was recently granted pediatric exclusivity and approved by the FDA for the treatment of pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. This is the first pediatric indication for Otezla. Enbrel sales decreased 2% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by volume decline, partially offset by higher inventory levels. Moving forward, we expect modest volume growth offset by declining net selling price. TEZSPIRE continues its strong trajectory with $173 million in sales in the first quarter. Sales increased 80% year-over-year, primarily driven by uptake of the prefilled single-use pen. In our rare disease business, sales of TAVNEOS were $51 million in the first quarter. Sales increased 122% year-over-year, driven by volume growth. In the U.S., more than 3,000 patients have now been treated with TAVNEOS by over 2,000 health care professionals. Looking forward, we'll continue to leverage our expertise in nephrology and inflammation to bring TAVNEOS to even more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Sales for our biosimilars portfolio grew 12% year-over-year for the first quarter, with volume growth partially offset by lower inventory levels and net selling price decline. We expect continued growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. In oncology, sales of our 6 innovative products, BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate and XGEVA, grew 4% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by volume growth. BLINCYTO sales grew 26% year-over-year to a record $244 million for the first quarter, driven by broad prescribing across academic and community segments for patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has set a PDUFA date of June 21 of this year for its decision on approving BLINCYTO as a treatment for patients with early-stage CD19-positive, B-cell ALL. We see significant growth potential for BLINCYTO from utilization in frontline treatment. LUMAKRAS sales increased 11% year-over-year for the first quarter to a record $82 million. We see future growth opportunities for LUMAKRAS coming from the launches in new markets and additional indications. Vectibix sales increased 6% year-over-year, driven by higher net selling price and volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact. KYPROLIS sales grew 5% year-over-year to a record $376 million for the first quarter, primarily driven by volume growth outside the U.S. Nplate sales decreased 12% year-over-year for the first quarter, primarily driven by volume decline in comparison to the first quarter of 2023, which included a U.S. government order of $82 million. Excluding the Q1 2023 U.S. government order, Nplate sales grew 13% year-over-year. I'm pleased with our execution in the quarter and the momentum across the 4 pillars of our business. And we look forward to serving many more patients around the world who can benefit from our innovative therapies. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram. Vikram Karnani : Thank you, Murdo. I am pleased to provide an update on rare disease, Amgen's fourth therapeutic pillar of growth, which delivered product sales of over $950 million in Q1. Beginning with TEPEZZA for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, or TED, first quarter sales were $424 million, reflecting growth of 5% year-over-year when compared to results from the legacy Horizon business. As we discussed at our rare disease investor meeting a few months back, TED is often assessed using the clinical activity score, or CAS, which covers a number of different signs and symptoms, including pain, redness, swelling and function. And we now refer to TED in terms of high and low clinical activity score or high and low CAS. For the approximately 100,000 TED patients in the U.S. who could benefit from TEPEZZA, the majority of these patients, roughly 80%, are in low CAS settings. We continue to focus on this large number of low CAS patients not being appropriately treated. As we previously discussed, one of the main hurdles in the patient journey in this setting is access. To help patients overcome that challenge, we have generated favorable medical policy changes for greater than 50% of U.S. covered lives, and we expect to continue this momentum throughout 2024. In addition, we are expanding our reach among new prescribers, particularly ophthalmologists and endocrinologists who manage many low CAS patients. The impact of TED on quality of life is often underestimated. So our focus is on educating health care providers about the significant effects on patients, even those with less visible symptoms. In addition to our focus on educating ocular surgeons and ophthalmologists, we are increasing our strategic focus in endocrinology and creating a dedicated sales force to engage in this important space. International expansion remains a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA, which is currently approved in Brazil and Saudi Arabia. As a reminder, in January, we filed for high CAS approval in Japan. And our Phase III trial in low CAS is continuing to enroll. We have completed additional regulatory submissions in Australia, Canada, Great Britain and most recently with the European Medicines Agency. We initiated a Phase III subcutaneous study and see this as an opportunity to increase adoption and improve the patient experience with an alternative option to our current IV formulation. KRYSTEXXA, for patients with chronic refractory gout, delivered $235 million in sales in Q1, representing 26% year-over-year growth, driven by volume growth from strong commercial execution. UPLIZNA, the fastest-growing biologic in NMOSD, delivered a record $80 million in net sales in Q1, representing 49% year-over-year growth. International expansion is also underway with UPLIZNA now launched in multiple ex-U.S. markets including Canada, which launched in January of this year. The integration of the legacy Horizon business continues to be on track as we leverage Amgen's leadership in inflammation, world-class manufacturing and process development and extensive global footprint. Now I will pass it over to Peter for our financial update. Peter Griffith : Thank you, Vikram. We're pleased with our performance and on track to meet our 2024 full goals and long-term objectives. Our strong growth outlook is driven across each of our 4 therapeutic pillars by our innovative pipeline and in-market portfolio products, which serve patients with serious illnesses around the globe. I'll review our first quarter results before discussing our 2024 guidance. As shown on Slide 23 of the slide deck, in the first quarter, we delivered $7.4 billion in total revenue, a 22% increase year-over-year. This reflects 25% volume growth, including over $900 million from acquired Horizon products and also key brands, including Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, Prolia and BLINCYTO. Excluding the addition of Horizon, product sales increased 6% year-over-year, driven by 9% volume growth. Our non-GAAP operating expenses rose by 33%, reflecting investments in Horizon acquired products, along with other late-stage pipeline medicines, including rocatinlimab, MariTide and tarlatamab. As a result, our Q1 operating margin was 43%, consistent with our guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call. Our non-GAAP OI&E resulted in $549 million expense, up $334 million year-over-year, almost entirely due to increased interest expense from debt issued for the Horizon acquisition, partially offset by higher interest income and gains from debt repurchases. Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased 2.4 percentage points year-over-year to 15.4%, primarily due to the change in earnings mix, the inclusion of the Horizon business, and net favorable items in the quarter. In the first quarter, the company generated $0.5 billion in free cash flow, a decrease from $0.7 billion in the previous year, primarily impacted by a planned $800 million tax deposit to the IRS to stop the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions, as we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call. As a reminder, there is no change in our belief in the merits of our legal position as we prepare for trial later this year. This impact on free cash flow was partially offset by the timing of working capital items. The Horizon integration is on track, and we expect to reach our pretax $500 million synergy target by year 3 post acquisition. We also expect to achieve roughly 50% of this synergy target in our annual run rate by the end of this year 2024. We expect accretion to non-GAAP EPS in 2024 and anticipate maintaining strong cash flow generation while we continue to execute on our deleveraging plan to return to our pre-acquisition efficient capital structure by the end of 2025. We remain on track to achieve the pre-acquisition leverage ratio, normalized for certain other noncash items, including fair value, market value adjustment of equity investments and Horizon acquisition-related costs. We remain committed to our multiple capital allocation priorities. We continue to prioritize investing in the best innovation, both internally and externally, with increased spending on late-stage programs, including olpasiran, bemarituzumab, MariTide and rocatinlimab. Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth, including expanding capacity in our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities. Our North Carolina site is expected to be operational by 2026. And Amgen Ohio opened in the first quarter and is utilizing artificial intelligence and extensive robotics to boost operational efficiencies. We're actively integrating generative AI across the enterprise to spearhead innovation and reinforce our leadership in the industry. This strategic commitment to innovative technology enables us to lead advancements, streamline drug development and enhance patient care more effectively. Finally, we returned capital to shareholders as we paid dividends of $2.25 per share in the first quarter. This represented a 6% increase over that paid in each of 2023's 4 quarters. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2024 on Slide 25. We expect our 2024 total revenues in the range of $32.5 billion to $33.8 billion and anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share between $19 and $20.20. I'll mention a few considerations as you model the remainder of 2024. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to increase by approximately 25% year-over-year versus our prior guidance to you roughly 20% year-over-year. We're making incremental investments based on our confidence in our late-stage pipeline. Our R&D investment reflects our commitment to innovation, accelerating our pipeline, focusing on advancing multiple potentially first-in-class and best-in-class medicines, including supporting MariTide, 2 PDUFA dates scheduled for June and 5 Phase III data readouts throughout the year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses over the second and third quarters are expected to grow at a rate comparable to the first quarter. The fourth quarter rate will normalize with a comparable expense base in the fourth quarter of 2023 since the Horizon transaction completed in early October 2023. We continue to anticipate our operating margin will improve over the next 3 quarters. We expect OI&E to be roughly $2.6 billion, which includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt raised for the Horizon acquisition. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 16%, primarily being driven by a more favorable jurisdictional mix of income, which includes the full year benefits associated with the inclusion of the Horizon business. Our capital expenditures guidance remains unchanged at approximately $1.1 billion in 2024. We've initiated activities to further expand manufacturing capacity for MariTide. We project full year Neulasta sales of approximately $500 million. Our long-term outlook remains robust. I am grateful to our 27,000-plus colleagues worldwide for their dedication to serving patients. So this concludes the financial update. I'll hand it now back to Bob for our Q&A session. Robert Bradway : Okay. Thank you, Peter. And before you open the line, Julianne, let me just point out that, obviously, we have a lot of exciting opportunities here. And we're excited about the ways we think we can make a difference for patients. In terms of the opportunity in obesity, again, we recognize that there's significant interest. And we provided today's update to keep you apprised of our plans in this area. But I would just reiterate, we're focused on successfully completing and maintaining the integrity of the ongoing Phase II studies. So as we turn to Q&A, just bear in mind that we're going to have to be very limited in what we can say beyond what we've already delivered in our prepared remarks on obesity and MariTide. But with that in mind, Julianne, maybe you could remind our callers of the process for asking questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter : On MariTide here, just given the move forward to Phase III, can you just remind us what you were looking to learn in the Phase II trial and likely did here, but that enabled you to kind of get confident here with the program on the [ forward ]? Robert Bradway : Sure. Salveen, thanks for the question. Why don't you jump in, Jay? James Bradner : Yes. Thanks, Salveen, for your question. Look, we're benefiting from a really well-designed and well-executed Phase II study, a study that can teach us a lot about this medicine and how it's best dosed and received. And we're seeing from these data in aggregate a broad and differentiated profile that will guide and also encourage a Phase III clinical investigation. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael Yee : I appreciate the update. I think we all do. Just to clarify or to ease any investor concerns, is it safe to say that your interim looked at all doses and you feel comfortable including the highest doses and safety metrics, including bone? And all of that was looked at to date? James Bradner : Thanks a lot, Michael. I'll take this one as well. Again, a very well-designed and well-executed study, a study that's replete with measurements. This is an ongoing study, so we have to be careful to avoid in introducing an inadvertent bias or unblinding. And so we just can't comment on individual characteristics, but we're very pleased with the results to date. We're moving rapidly forward with the Phase III program as well as the diabetes Phase II. I would reiterate that all the arms remain active, and we haven't had an issue with patient dropout to date. Robert Bradway : I think, again, Michael, as Jay said, it's a well-designed study, and you can be sure that we review the data carefully. Operator : Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Great. Jay, you mentioned on MariTide seeing a differentiated profile. Recognize you're limited in what you can say. But as we think about areas of differentiation, it's clearly efficacy, tolerability and dosing interval. So just wondering if you can comment on which of those areas you're differentiated on? And then what benchmark are you looking to? Is it semaglutide, tirzepatide, both of those? Robert Bradway : Thanks, Terence. Again, we can appreciate the desire to get into that detail. But maybe, Murdo, do you want to speak to the competitive differentiation? And then Jay, if there's anything you feel appropriate to elaborate on, you can jump in after Murdo. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks for the question, Terence. Thanks, Bob. Obviously, we're watching the in-market products very closely with respect to differentiation. And we're also looking at products that are in the clinic being developed. And we continue to feel very confident in our ability to have a differentiated and broad profile for MariTide as we develop it in this Phase II and as we consider our broader Phase III development program. James Bradner : Yes. I'd just add, this is, Terence, a very exciting, very dynamic area. We follow the development of obesity medicines very closely. And I think in this case, the actions we're taking speak for themselves. We're hard at work planning a comprehensive and competitive Phase III program. Operator : Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Congrats on all the progress and thanks for providing the update. Maybe just to shift gears a little bit to tarlatamab. With the potential launch rapidly approaching, can you just talk about the work you're doing to prepare for that launch and the strategy behind the initial launch in the late line and then the clinical and commercial work to go behind expanding the profile and potential for tarlatamab? Robert Bradway : Yes, let's take that in 2 pieces. And maybe, Murdo, you can talk about the launch. And then I'm sure, Jay, you'd like to elaborate on the thinking for the clinical development of this. Murdo Gordon : Sure. Jay, thank you for the question on another exciting product in our portfolio, one that I think will deliver a lot of benefit for patients with small cell lung cancer, which is a very, very difficult diagnosis with very little in the way of highly effective treatments that deliver any kind of durable response in small cell. So we're anxiously awaiting approval from the FDA, but we are well prepared and have been for some time across our field organizations. All our field personnel, including their medical teams, are trained and prepared. We have very clear plans to reach treating physicians in very short order post approval. We have a very clear understanding of making sure that we can provide broad access to tarlatamab when it's approved. And we feel really good about this. This is a very important moment not just for Amgen but for the treatment of patients with small cell lung cancer where, quite frankly, the survival in the late-stage setting is really dismal and is a matter of single-digit months. And so we have a huge opportunity here to impact, and we're not wasting any minute, any hour or any day in our planning to do that. James Bradner : And Jay, thanks for highlighting the potential of this medicine, which we consider a major advance. The treatment of this disease has really not meaningfully evolved since I trained as an oncologist in the mid-90s with upfront chemotherapy and meaningful but incremental benefit to immuno-oncology therapy with PD-L1 agents today. And so this is the case where time just can't move fast enough to get this medicine into earlier lines of therapy. And so we have initiated 3 Phase III studies. And as you asked, I'll just give an architecture of them briefly. We have a study that will compare to tarlatamab to standard of care chemotherapy. And this is in the second line dedicated patients with a primary endpoint of overall survival, and this study is enrolling. We really want to get this medicine tested in frontline therapy, where, as you must know, patients progress so quickly that a great many of them never reach the chance to receive second and third-line therapy. And so in a pair of trials, one for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer and one for limited-stage small cell lung cancer, we'll study the contribution of tarlatamab immediately following upfront therapy with response. We've learned through the development of these BiTE molecules that they work best when they're given as early as possible in the course of treatment for a disease. That has been the case with ALL as we move into frontline. And we've also learned that they work best when there is a low burden of disease. And so the design of these 3 Phase III studies will bring this medicine to earlier patient therapy lines. And I'll say there's been intense interest and great hope in this community. And so we expect to enroll these studies expeditiously. Operator : Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : I have a question regarding the manufacturing of AMG 133. Could you help us understand how complicated or simpler it is versus the traditional GLP-1s peptide base in terms of complexity as well as cost? And what kind of investment do you think we should be expecting as you go -- as you embark on this journey? Robert Bradway : Mohit, I don't think we're intimidated about the challenge on the manufacturing or the process development front. I think, again, we've established ourselves firmly as a world leader in biotherapeutic manufacturing. And as you know, this is a therapy that's based on a antibody backbone. So it's right down the middle of the fairway for us. We've -- not lost on us that these competitors who are in the market now have found it difficult to maintain supply of these medicines, and I'm sure that's not lost in the patients either. And we're determined to do our best to make sure that we uphold our long tradition of supplying every patient, every time in the marketplace. So again, we think this is down the middle of the fairway in terms of the technical challenges that we need to address. We think that -- we look forward to being able to do that. And again, as I said, maintaining our track record of every patient, every time. In terms of your question about what it will require from us over time, obviously, to the extent that, that becomes meaningful, Mohit, we'll have the opportunity to address it down the road. But as Peter said in his remarks, our capital expenditure guidance for the year embraces the activity that we have underway to make ourselves ready for the clinical and commercial challenge that we see imminently. Operator : Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : I'll spare all my curiosities on your ongoing trial. But I will ask this. One, on manufacturing capacity. I'm curious, is your aim to have 1 million to 2 million patients worth of capacity or 5 million to 10 million? You can imagine from a modeling perspective, from a CapEx side, this would be relevant, knowing obviously how much manufacturing experience and capacity you guys have. And then secondly, the -- is it a pen device? I know you mentioned it's a \"handheld patient-friendly auto-injector\" which is a single injection. But is it a pen device or is it something else? Robert Bradway : Yes. So Umer, I don't think we're going to say anything more about the delivery -- expected delivery device at this point. I think we were as clear as we could be. And we think it will be patient-friendly and convenient. And with respect to the quantity of patients that we expect to serve, we recognize that the unmet need here is very large, and we want to be in position to supply the patients that we think will be interested in the differentiated profile of our medicine. I would point out to you and I hope you're aware that we are already serving millions of patients today around the globe with our biotherapeutics. So again, we're used to supplying many millions of patients with antibody-based therapies. I think we're pushing up on 8 million Prolia patients right now worldwide. So we understand what it takes to supply large quantities of antibody therapies and what it means to do that with successful delivery devices. And I'm sure it's not lost on all of you that the fact that, as Jay said, the delivery dosing schedule is likely to be monthly or less frequently implies far fewer injection devices than competitors who, for example, are administering a weekly therapy. So again, all in all, we recognize the reasons for your questions on supply. But I hope you recognize as well the reasons why we're confident that we'll be up to that challenge. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregory Renza from RBC Capital Markets. Gregory Renza : Congrats on the updates as well. And just a question on your larger obesity and cardiometabolic strategy. Certainly, with the news on 786 and as you speak to MariTide's efforts on convenience, how are you thinking about oral options within your portfolio now that you are certainly levered towards MariTide as the lead asset? I'm just curious how oral options should fit in with the portfolio longer term. James Bradner : Gregory, thank you. This differentiated profile that we're seeing with MariTide really raises the bar for Amgen obesity medicines. And the profile for 786 just did not meet that bar in our assessment. We do have a pipeline, a strong pipeline of earlier assets. There are incretin as well as non-incretin based. Some are injectable and some are oral. And we believe that the heterogeneity, the diversity of the marketplace of -- and honestly, the different types of patients that will need medicines for obesity and all the obesity-related conditions demands medicines with different profiles, and we are hard at work on that. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Timothy Anderson : On MariTide, I'll ask a question on differentiation that I think you should be able to answer, which is, can you remind us what in the past you felt would be differentiating based on what the Phase I showed? So I'm not asking you to comment on what you just recently saw, but just a reminder of past comments on what you felt the data seemed to show in that front. Less frequent dosing frequency, of course, is the obvious one, but what else? Murdo Gordon : Yes. Tim, I think we've been fairly consistent on what we believe an opportunity is to differentiate in the market, both in the past and obviously as we see the interim analysis of these results. We think that we have a broad opportunity to differentiate with MariTide. And by that, I mean a broad differentiated profile on a number of fronts. And we continue to believe that we will be able to move into the market with a differentiated product, establish MariTide as a really good opportunity to address unmet medical needs and provide access for millions of patients as we go forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. Yaron Werber : Congrats on the update. So I'm just going to ask a question I think you can answer on -- it's a little technical in nature. In the interim analysis for MariTide, was it blinded or not blinded? And then just remind us, is there a dose titration in that study? James Bradner : Sure. This is Jay, Yaron. Thank you. The interim analysis, we as R&D leaders have had an ability to see the assigned treatment arms of the study. But importantly, this interim analysis is blinded to investigators and to participants to preserve the integrity of the study. Operator : Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoffrey Meacham : Thanks for the question. Yet another one on MariTide. Just given Amgen's cardio portfolio and focus, do you have any updated thoughts on expanding the program beyond just diabetes and obesity? Obviously, recognizing that you now have a better picture of the safety and tolerability profile. James Bradner : Yes. Thank you, Geoff, for asking and allowing a clarification. What we're observing with MariTide and what we intended for the development of MariTide continues at pace. And we're preparing for a broad Phase III program that can work to address the unmet needs in obesity and a number of obesity-related conditions and, as you heard, in diabetes as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : I'm not going to ask on MariTide, although I am tempted to. I actually want to ask one on rocatinlimab. So with the Horizon ROCKET studies upcoming, can you just talk us through what the differentiations you want to see? And how would you position this asset versus, say, the entrenched Dupixent and RINVOQ in the atopic dermatitis space? Robert Bradway : Two pieces. Maybe Jay can address the clinical perspective on differentiation. And then Murdo, to the extent it's appropriate, you can jump in on how to think about positioning it. James Bradner : Yes. It sounds as though, Evan, you're close to this work. But as you know, rocatinlimab is an OX40-directed monoclonal antibody, afucosylated IgG1, a strong ADCC. We have a program called ROCKET that has over 2,800 patients enrolled. And so to address differentiation, I'm going to limit that maybe scope to the atopic dermatitis space. And here in the Horizon, the so called Horizon study, it's a Phase III randomized controlled trial. It's in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. It's 726 patients actually enrolled. And in this case, it's rocatinlimab every 4 weeks against placebo with a 24-week treatment readout. We have endpoints at 16 and 24 weeks. We will -- it's always apples to oranges to compare between trials, but we hope to observe and expect to observe in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis a very competitive profile with strong efficacy and excellent patient experience and tolerability. Here, we think about Dupixent and follow that work in its development closely. And Murdo, I leave it to you to talk through how to best think about differentiation. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks, Jay. And thanks for the question, Evan. We are studying, as Jay mentioned, a broad population of patients in atopic dermatitis. So we will have some patients that will have previous biologic experience as well as bio-naive. So we will know how to position this product effectively in the market. I would just -- I would perhaps use the recent experience of how we launched TEZSPIRE and differentiated against Dupixent in a different indication using a highly differentiated mechanism and the fact that prescribers in this area are looking for alternatives to nonresponsive patients and to bio-naive patients. So we feel good about the opportunity here. But obviously, we have to await data and see the readouts of the clinical trials. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Can you just elaborate a little bit more on TEZSPIRE and its potential role in COPD post the Phase II data? And maybe as part of that, how broadly do you expect to study this compound in Phase III, I guess, given the efficacy across the different eosinophil counts that we saw in the Phase II program? James Bradner : Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. It's Jay again. And so the Phase II COPD data will be presented in an oral presentation, as I mentioned, at the American Thoracic Society Meeting later this month. And so as that work and its abstract are presently embargoed, there is a natural limit to what I'm able to share. But what I will remind, as you asked more mechanistically, is that TSLP comes from this family of what are called alarmins. And they do just what it sounds like they do. An epithelium, inflamed or irritated or activated, that's inflamed releases TSLP and triggers what's called type 2 inflammation. There are a number of signaling factors that participate in type 2 inflammation. But then, TSLP then converges down in this type 2 T-cell inflammatory milieu in response also involving eosinophils. And that's why we often invoke that measurement in clinical investigation. The rationale for COPD is as strong as it is for asthma. But COPD, if you must know, is a much more heterogeneous disease than asthma. And so the design of this clinical trial appreciated and understood that and built into it some predefined stratifications for analysis, one of which was this eosinophil threshold of 150 cells per microliter. And so we look forward to sharing the full data. We have already disclosed that there's clinically meaningful activity of the molecule in this randomized controlled trial. And so please expect more at the ATS. You asked about the more broad development. You are right that TSLP is not only a feature of an inflamed airway epithelium but other epithelial surfaces as well. Hence, our interest to develop it in eosinophilic esophagitis as well as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. And both of these diseases are characterized molecularly by type 2 inflammation. Operator : Our next question comes from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. James Shin : This one is a little bit off the reservation. It's for Jay and on oncology. It's for AMG 651, the EGFR CD3. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that. I think there's going to be some data coming up soon, and there's some other data that's come out recently from peers. James Bradner : Yes. Well, I would say this, James. Thanks for the question. We have a large experience of developing CD3 bispecifics. And we have learned over time to tune the potency of engagement to the cell surface antigen to the degree of engagement and activation of the CD3. And there is no news to share with you at this moment. We continue to study this and other solid tumor-targeting T-cell-engaging bispecifics, really buoyed by the confidence and the guidance from tarlatamab and xaluritamig. So I would expect more in the future on that medicine as well as other solid tumor-targeting bispecific T-cell engagers. Operator : Our next question comes from Kripa Devarakonda from Truist Securities. Srikripa Devarakonda : I have a question on TEPEZZA in TED. Can you please talk about where you are with this subcu program? I think the Phase III is ongoing. Just a little bit of update on that. And as you continue to treat more patients with TED, what are you hearing about concerns around safety concerns? And is that having any impact on uptake? Robert Bradway : We'll take it in 2 parts. Jay, you can address the clinical questions. And then to the extent that, Vikram, you want to share any thoughts on the marketplace, jump in. James Bradner : Yes, thanks for the question. The development of a subcutaneous administration of TEPEZZA is a major priority for Amgen R&D in the program. We have initiated a Phase III study. This will be -- this is in moderate to severe active TED. And the design is akin to what we have reported already with the intravenous label-enabling studies completed to date. And Vikram, if you want to speak to the clinical experience. Vikram Karnani : Yes, I think -- so thanks for the question. I think the question was around AEs and if that is limiting growth. And I imagine, Kripa, that you're maybe specifically referring to hearing loss or about hearing loss. So let's start at the top. TEPEZZA, it very effectively treats TED, which we all now is a pretty severe and debilitating disease. IGF-1, we know is going to be involved in hearing function. So during the clinical assessment and the clinical development of TEPEZZA, we very carefully have -- we looked at -- we assessed hearing function. We now have included this in the warnings and precautions section of the PI, along with a recommendation for assessment and monitoring. It's important because patients who use TEPEZZA should be monitored for any specific experience with hearing impairment. We're also working with professional societies to increase education. And while many physicians do use a baseline hearing assessment, getting it in the label helps standardize this approach, okay? So after working through the management of this with HCPs, this has not generally turned to be a barrier for growth as physicians generally understand the favorable risk-benefit profile of TEPEZZA. Robert Bradway : Thank you. So Julianne, we're pushing up to the appointed bottom of the hour here, but we still have a few questions in the queue. So we'll take a couple more to try to get through your questions. If we don't get to everybody, obviously, Justin and his team will be around this evening to answer any questions. But let's try and click through these, the ones we can quickly, Julianne. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt from Guggenheim Partners. Michael Schmidt : I had one on BLINCYTO, which has recently gained some commercial momentum recently. And there was some interesting academic data reported last week in Nature Medicine showing some activity in RA. And so I was just wondering if you have any plans? Or how are you thinking about potentially developing BLINCYTO or maybe other BiTEs in autoimmune? Robert Bradway : Sorry. In autoimmune disorders? Michael Schmidt : Yes. James Bradner : Thanks for your question. With very deep expertise here in CD19-directed therapeutics, with deep and committed expertise in inflammation and autoimmunity, we've been following this space very closely, the early suggestive evidence from CAR T-cell therapy and, more recently, this work that's been reported in systemic sclerosis. And as you noted, 6 patients with quite refractory rheumatoid arthritis is very exciting to see. And so you can imagine that we're well organized around this opportunity. And we found that work quite inspiring and we'll have more to report in the future. Justin Claeys : Julianne, I think we've got time for one more question. Operator : Our last question will come from Gary Nachman from Raymond James. Gary Nachman : Great. So back to MariTide, I have to finish with that. As you're planning for the Phase III studies, do you have a sense of when you could start those? How big those might be? And anything about design and overall timing relative to other Phase III studies in this space? And any strategies you have to accelerate those studies as quickly as possible and how you'll incorporate both U.S. and ex U.S. in the program? Robert Bradway : So Gary, again, we appreciate it. I can understand why you'd be asking those questions. As I said in my remarks, we will do our level best now to successfully complete the Phase II study and then work swiftly with regulators to agree the program that establishes safety and efficacy in Phase III, and we'll do that as swiftly as we can. We recognize there's a huge unmet need still in the marketplace, and we believe we have an asset that can help address that. But Jay, I don't know whether you feel you can say anything more specific, but jump in if you do. James Bradner : Yes, I'd say the same, Bob. Gary, as you know, this is one part, collecting the data that regulators rightly expect, and ongoing conversations around the design. This study is moving as rapidly as possible within -- this program is moving as rapidly as possible within the organization, you can rest assured. Robert Bradway : Okay. Well, again, let me thank you all for joining the call and reiterate that Justin and his team will be around if you have any further questions. We look forward to having an opportunity to talk to you in the summer after the second quarter and provide update on the flow of information that we expect to generate between now and then on the many programs that we've referred to on the call. So thank you for your interest. Appreciate it. Operator : This concludes our 2024 Q1 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at conclusion of the last speaker\u2019s prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we will like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Justin Claeys, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Claeys, you may now begin. Justin Claeys : Thank you, Julianne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Murdo Gordon, Vikram Karnani, Jay Bradner and Peter Griffith. Through the course of our discussion today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and have provided appropriate reconciliations within the materials that accompany this call. We will also make some forward-looking statements, which are qualified by our safe harbor statement. And please note that actual results can vary materially. Over to you, Bob. Bob Bradway : Okay. Well, thank you, Justin, and let me thank all of you for joining the call today. We're especially grateful in light of all of the volatility in the markets that you would carve out the time to be with us. So thank you. Through the first half of the year, our business is performing well, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive long-term growth. We're achieving strong results the same way we always have, which is by providing innovative medicines to address challenging diseases. Starting with the in-market portfolio. Second quarter revenues grew 20% to $8.4 billion with numerous medicines delivering double-digit sales growth, including in general medicine, Repatha and EVENITY, in oncology, of course, BLINCYTO, an inflammation TEZSPIRE, and then turning to rare disease, which delivered more than $1 billion on the quarter. I would highlight that KRYSTEXXA, UPLIZNA and TAVNEOS, each delivered at least double-digit sales growth in the quarter, and TEPEZZA grew 8% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter. All of these first or best-in-class medicines are still early in their life cycles and have plenty of room to run through geographic expansion, new indications and/or new formulations. You'll hear more about these brands in a moment. Turning to research and development. We believe our pipeline looks very promising as well, not just in obesity, but across all of our therapeutic areas. We told you at the beginning of the year that we were anticipating more than a dozen significant pipeline milestones in 2024. We are, so far, so good. In the second quarter alone, we received accelerated approval for IMDELLTRA, a landmark new medicine for small cell lung cancer. And in fact, the physicians I've spoken to since approval are really excited about this drug as the first meaningful innovation in decades for these patients. We also received approval for BLINCYTO in the frontline treatment for B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, based on significantly improved overall survival rates. The frontline approval meaningfully expands the potential impact of BLINCYTO for all patients with B-ALL. We announced impressive Phase III data for UPLIZNA in IgG4-related disease, which is a grievous illness for which there are no currently approved therapies of any kind. Building on our success with TEZSPIRE in treating severe asthma, we announced exciting data from our Phase II study in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that earned this molecule breakthrough therapy designation. COPD is the world's third leading cause of death, and new treatment options are very much needed. We look forward to additional data readouts later this year across therapeutic areas, highlighted, of course, by top line data from the ongoing MariTide Phase II study. We're encouraged by the emerging data in this field, particularly in cardiovascular and renal disease areas of long-standing strategic focus for us. We are laser focused on preparing to launch a broad Phase III program for MariTide that includes obesity, obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes, and we're further ramping our investment to support MariTide in the rest of the pipeline. You'll hear more about that pipeline shortly on this call. All in all, this is a very exciting time for us at Amgen. And as always, I'm grateful to my Amgen colleagues all around the world for their enduring commitment to patients. And now let me turn things over to Murdo. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Bob. Execution was strong in the second quarter, driving 20% year-over-year sales growth and all of our regions delivered attractive growth. Sales of 12 products grew at least double digits, including Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, TAVNEOS and BLINCYTO, all brands that are important to our future growth. Starting with our General Medicine portfolio. Sales of Repatha, EVENITY and Prolia collectively grew 20% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by volume growth. Repatha sales increased 25% year-over-year to $532 million for the second quarter, now well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar business. In the quarter, we saw year-over-year volume growth of 46%, partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., we see increased recognition of the importance of lowering LDL cholesterol by health care providers, payers and patients, which has significantly accelerated volume growth for Repatha. Our efforts have broadened insurance coverage and removed prior authorization requirements by several payers. In a recent survey, roughly 95% of cardiologists responded that Repatha is accessible and that access has improved significantly versus two years ago. EVENITY sales increased 39% year-over-year to $391 million for the second quarter. In the U.S., volume growth was supported by both increased prescription volume from existing EVENITY prescribers and an expansion of new prescribers. In Japan, EVENITY has been prescribed to approximately 600,000 patients to date and continues to be the segment leader with 45% of the bone builder segment. There are many women who remain at risk of a fracture due to postmenopausal osteoporosis. We're encouraged by the growth momentum we are driving and have conviction in the potential for EVENITY to help even more patients. Prolia sales increased 13% year-over-year to $1.2 billion for the second quarter. Volume growth continues to be supported by real-world evidence demonstrating Prolia superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis at high risk of fracture. In inflammation, TEZSPIRE continues its strong trajectory with $234 million sales in the second quarter. Sales increased 76% year-over-year, primarily driven by uptake of the prefilled single-use pen. We see strong growth opportunity for TEZSPIRE given its unique differentiated profile and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe uncontrolled asthma. Otezla sales decreased 9% year-over-year for the second quarter with 2% volume growth offset by lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. In the U.S., we saw a 3% year-over-year growth in new patient prescriptions in the quarter, driven by strong execution by our dermatology sales force and increased Otezla direct-to-consumer media activity. We've seen an increasingly competitive environment in dermatology with the introduction of novel topicals and new biologic treatments. Otezla retains an important role in this landscape given its broad label, safety profile and unique positioning as a first systemic treatment option for patients with cirrhosis. Enbrel sales decreased 15% year-over-year for the second quarter, primarily driven by lower net selling price. Going forward, we expect continued declining net selling price and relatively flat volumes. Enbrel is known for its efficacy and trusted by physicians. Its substantial health benefits and cash flow generation provide a solid foundation for our business. Turning now to biosimilars, where sales of our biosimilar products were relatively stable year-over-year for the second quarter. We're positioned for future growth with upcoming launches, WEZLANA, a biosimilar to Stelara and BEKEMV, a biosimilar to Soliris, are both expected to launch in the U.S. in Q1 of 2025. Our vertically integrated biosimilar business model ensures efficiency and provides attractive cash flows and returns for our shareholders. In oncology, sales of our seven innovative products, BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate, XGEVA and IMDELLTRA grew 12% year-over-year for the second quarter, driven by volume growth and higher net selling prices. In total, these products contributed almost $2 billion of sales in the second quarter. BLINCYTO sales grew 28% year-over-year to $264 million for the second quarter, driven by broad prescribing across academic and community segments for patients with B-cell ALL. BLINCYTO was recently granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a frontline consolidation treatment for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell ALL. Our commercial and medical teams are engaging key academic, regional and community customers in establishing BLINCYTO as a standard of care in this setting. LUMAKRAS sales increased 10% year-over-year to $85 million for the second quarter. We see future growth opportunities for LUMAKRAS coming from launches in new markets and additional indications. Back to back sales increased 9% year-over-year to $270 million for the second quarter, now annualizing at over $1 billion. We also drove strong performance of KYPROLIS, which grew 9% year-over-year and Nplate, which grew 12% year-over-year. Since our U.S. launch of IMDELLTRA in mid-May, we generated $12 million of sales in the second quarter. IMDELLTRA was recently approved for the treatment of adult patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. We're seeing strong clinical conviction in IMDELLTRA in both academic and community settings, and while very early in the launch, we're encouraged by the adoption of IMDELLTRA and look forward to its potential to bring new possibilities to patients living with this aggressive disease. I'm pleased with our execution in the quarter, driving accelerated performance for our most important growth brands. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram, who will cover our rare disease portfolio. Vikram Karnani : Thank you, Murdo. I am pleased to provide an update on rare disease, which delivered product sales of over $1.1 billion in Q2. Beginning with TEPEZZA for the treatment of thyroid-eye disease, second quarter sales were $479 million, reflecting growth of 8% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter, when compared to results from the legacy Horizon business. Recall that there are roughly 100,000 TED patients in the U.S., and penetration is currently only in the single digits. The main growth opportunity is within the roughly 80% of TED patients who have a low clinical activity score or CAS. We are expanding our reach among new prescribers, particularly ophthalmologists and endocrinologists who manage many of the low cash patients who can benefit from TEPEZZA. The impact of thyroid-eye disease on quality of life is often underestimated. So our focus is on educating health care providers about the significant effects on patients, even those with less visible symptoms. In addition, we are increasing our strategic focus in endocrinology with a dedicated sales force to engage in this important space. We are also making significant strides in improving access. Thanks to the recognition of TEPEZZA's efficacy by payers. To date, we have achieved favorable medical policy changes for greater than 55% of U.S. covered lives, compared to 50% last quarter and just 5% roughly one year ago. We expect to continue this momentum throughout 2024. International expansion remains a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA with regulatory filings complete or underway in multiple geographies. With Japan as the next significant launch expected by early 2025. We also initiated a Phase III subcutaneous study and see this as an opportunity to increase adoption and improve the patient experience with an alternative option to our current IV formulation. KRYSTEXXA for patients with chronic refractory gout, delivered $294 million in sales in Q2, representing 20% year-over-year growth driven by volume growth from strong commercial execution. KRYSTEXXA with immunomodulation continues to redefine the standard of care for uncontrolled gout. UPLIZNA, for patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, or NMOSD, delivered $92 million in sales in Q2, representing 35% year-over-year growth. International expansion of UPLIZNA is also underway with launches in multiple ex U.S. markets, including Canada, which launched earlier this year. In addition to NMOSD, we are excited about the impressive Phase III results with UPLIZNA in IgG4-related disease. And the potential it has to address a debilitating condition that impacts more than 20,000 patients in the U.S. We also look forward to the Phase III readout for UPLIZNA in myasthenia gravis later this year. Jay will address these in more detail in a moment. Sales of TAVNEOS were $71 million for the second quarter. Sales increased 137% year-over-year driven by volume growth. In the U.S., more than 3,500 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis have been treated with TAVNEOS. Over 2,300 health care professionals have now prescribed TAVNEOS, a roughly 35% increase in the prescriber base so far this year. The integration of the legacy Horizon business is progressing nicely as we leverage Amgen's leadership in inflammation, world-class manufacturing and process development and extensive global footprint. Now I will pass it over to Jay for our R&D update. Jay Bradner : Thank you, Vikram, and good afternoon, everyone. In the second quarter, we rapidly advanced our broad clinical pipeline of potentially first-in-class or best-in-class programs. We received two approvals in the quarter, a breakthrough therapy designation and delivered exciting clinical data for many programs, while eagerly awaiting additional data readouts later this year. Let's begin with general medicine. As previously mentioned, based on the interim analysis, we are seeing a differentiated profile with MariTide and are confident it will address important unmet medical needs in obesity, obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes. We remain on track and look forward to top line 52-week data from the ongoing MariTide Phase II study in late 2024. We are actively planning and expect to initiate a broad Phase III program in obesity, obesity-related conditions and diabetes, along with a Phase II trial investigating MariTide for the treatment of diabetes in patients with and without obesity. Beyond MariTide, we continue to progress our early obesity programs that consists of both oral and injectable incretin and non-incretin approaches. We expect one of these programs to enter clinical development later this year. Also in Gen med is olpasiran, our potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA medicine, the fully enrolled Phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial of olpasiran continues to progress. To remind, Lp(a) is a genetically defined cardiovascular risk factor that is elevated in approximately 20% of individuals and for whom no effective or targeted therapies currently exist. In oncology, we continue to deliver on high conviction targets with differentiated therapies capable of delivering transformative clinical benefit for patients. Let's begin with IMDELLTRA, a first-in-class bispecific T-cell engager or BiTE molecule targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. We're very pleased that the FDA granted accelerated approval to IMDELLTRA for the treatment of adult patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Further, we are pleased that the NCCN guidelines have been updated to include IMDELLTRA as a preferred option for patients with a chemotherapy-free interval less than or equal to six months and as an other recommended treatment option for patients with a chemotherapy-free interval greater than sixmonths. Based on the remarkable activity observed as a single agent in patients receiving second and third-line therapy, we are rapidly advancing IMDELLTRA into frontline therapy with three Phase III studies underway in both extensive and limited stage disease. One of these studies, DeLLphi-304, our confirmatory Phase III study in second-line small cell lung cancer has completed enrollment. Notably, IMDELLTRA is the first bispecific T-cell engager approved to treat a common solid tumor. The present study of tarlatamab in earlier lines and in the context of lower tumor burden, draws from our experience with our first approved bispecific T-cell engager BLINCYTO and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here, we observed a dramatic improvement in overall survival in minimal residual disease negative patients, along with improved tolerability. These BLINCYTO data provide evidence that directing the T cell in this manner is an effective means of finding and eliminating residual cancer cells that are drivers of occurrence. This June, based on the profound survival benefit observed in the treatment of frontline disease, the FDA approved an additional indication for BLINCYTO for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients one month or older with CD19 positive, Philadelphia chromosome negative, B-cell ALL and the consolidation phase of treatment, here regardless of minimal residual disease status. We continue to seek to expand the impact of BLINCYTO in newly diagnosed B-ALL through ongoing studies and with the further investigation of subcutaneous administration. Our first-in-class STEAP1 CD3 bispecific molecule, xaluritamig, has also demonstrated profound clinical activity in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, importantly, demonstrating our ability to target a second common solid tumor with a bispecific T-cell engager therapy. We are rapidly advancing this program and have now fully enrolled the monotherapy Phase I dose expansion as we continue to enroll patients in reduced monitoring and outpatient cohorts. Further, we are advancing the study of xaluritamig earlier in the prostate cancer treatment paradigm with combinations of xaluritamig and enzalutamide or abiraterone ongoing while we plan additional studies in earlier disease settings. In sum, with regard IMDELLTRA, BLINCYTO, xaluritamig as major advances, further establishing the broad potential of our leading bispecific T cell engager platform. To round out oncology, we have completed enrollment of FORTITUDE-101, a Phase III study of bemarituzumab, a first-in-class fibroblast growth factor receptor IIb directed monoclonal antibody administered in combination with chemotherapy in frontline gastric cancer. We are also rapidly advancing AMG 193, our oral PRMT5 inhibitor developed for MTAP-null solid tumors as both a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies. Additional data from the Phase I dose escalation and initial dose expansion study of AMG 193 in patients with MTAP-null solid tumors will be presented at ESMO in September. Lastly, we are pleased also to share that the FDA has granted an orphan drug designation to AMG 193 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Turning to inflammation. We are encouraged by the data arising from our Phase II study of TEZSPIRE in patients with moderate to very severe COPD. Together with AstraZeneca, we are actively planning for Phase III development in COPD. We are also pleased to announce that the FDA recently granted TEZSPIRE, a Breakthrough Therapy Designation as an add-on maintenance treatment of patients with moderate to very severe COPD, characterized by the eosinophilic phenotype. Beyond COPD, we continue to explore TEZSPIRE in separate Phase III studies in eosinophilic esophagitis and in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where top line data are expected later this year. Turning to rocatinlimab, a first-in-class T cell rebalancing monoclonal antibody targeting the OX40 receptor. The comprehensive rocatinlimab Phase III ROCKET program has successfully enrolled over 3,100 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Five of the eight studies are now fully enrolled. The Phase III HORIZON study, part of this ROCKET program evaluates rocatinlimab monotherapy versus placebo in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. And it is ongoing with data readout anticipated in H2. Beyond atopic dermatitis, we continue to explore the potential of rocatinlimab in additional indications and have initiated a Phase II study in moderate to severe asthma as well as a Phase III study in prurigo nodularis. Shifting to rare disease, we are encouraged by the advancements of our rare disease pipeline with several mid- to late-stage opportunities. UPLIZNA, a CD19 B-cell depleting therapy offers a differentiated mechanism of action than other autoimmune therapies, durable efficacy with a convenient every six-month IV dosing schedule. This could be very important for chronic inflammatory diseases. Recently, we were excited to announce positive top line results from a Phase III clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of UPLIZNA for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related disease. The trial met its primary endpoint, showing an astonishing 87% reduction in the risk of IgG4-related disease flare, as compared to placebo during the 52-week placebo-controlled window. All key secondary endpoints were also met and no new safety signals were identified. This is the first randomized controlled trial to demonstrate efficacy in the IgG4-related disease patient population. Regulatory filing activities are underway and full data from the trial will be presented at a future medical meeting. We are also studying a UPLIZNA in generalized myasthenia gravis through the ongoing Phase III MINT study. The MINT study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of UPLIZNA in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis, who are of a comparable disease severity and a comparable treatment experience to other recently approved biologic therapies. We are investigating UPLIZNA in the two predominant antibody serotypes that drive this disease, acetylcholine receptor positive and in muscle specific tyrosine kinase positive patients. MINT is the only trial attempting to demonstrate efficacy while removing the treatment benefit of steroids. Patients in the MINT trial who entered on steroids had a protocol specified taper by 24 weeks. We look forward to data readout in the second half of 2024. To expand the impact of our CD19 directed therapeutics to even more patients suffering from serious inflammatory diseases, compelled by both biological inferences and insights from small studies of CD19-directed therapies, we are launching a development program targeting CD19 positive B cell-mediated autoimmune disease with UPLIZNA and blinatumomab. This is an exciting and promising space with Amgen's strong capabilities in inflammatory disease and two well-characterized assets, we are very well positioned to lead in this rapidly advancing field. We will have more to say about these programs in due course. Lastly, in May, the FDA approved BEKEMV as the first interchangeable biosimilar to Soliris or eculizumab. Also in biosimilar development, registration-enabling studies are underway for ABP 234 and a biosimilar candidate to KEYTRUDA and ABP 206, a biosimilar candidate to OPDIVO. In closing, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for their strong sense of service to patients facing serious illness, their intense focus and spirited collaboration during this momentous year and their commitment to growing the impact of both our research and our business through this portfolio of potential first-in-class and best-in-class medicines. I'll now turn it over to Peter. Peter Griffith : Thank you, Jay. We're pleased with our strong second quarter performance and are on track with our 2024 full year goals and long-term objectives. We have a strong long-term growth outlook across our four therapeutic areas, driven by the breadth and depth of our innovative pipeline and in-market products, serving patients with serious illnesses around the globe. Starting with our second quarter results, as shown on Slide 27 of the slide deck, we delivered $8.4 billion in total revenue, a 20% increase year-over-year. It's the highest quarterly revenue in Amgen history, achieved with 26% volume growth. This means more patients than ever are receiving Amgen medicines. Excluding the addition of Horizon, product sales increased 5% year-over-year, driven by 10% volume growth. In the second quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 48.2% as a percentage of product sales with total non-GAAP operating expenses increasing 30% year-over-year. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 0.4 percentage points on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by higher royalties and profit share due to changes in sales mix. Non-GAAP R&D spending in the second quarter increased 30% year-over-year as we strategically invested in the late-stage pipeline, including MariTide, rocatinlimab and bemarituzumab as well as Horizon acquired programs. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by the addition of Horizon. Excluding the addition of Horizon, non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 14% year-over-year, driven by investment in Repatha, Otezla and EVENITY. Our non-GAAP OI&E resulted in a $700 million expense, up $400 million year-over-year, almost entirely due to increased interest expenses from the Horizon acquisition. We remain on track to deleverage with line of sight to retiring greater than $10 billion of debt by the end of 2025. This includes $1.4 billion of debt retired in the second quarter and $2.0 billion year-to-date. Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased 1.5 percentage points year-over-year to 14.9%, primarily due to the change in sales mix from the inclusion of our Horizon. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow, a decrease of $3.8 billion -- a decrease from $3.8 billion in the previous year, driven by the timing of tax payments. In 2023, federal tax payments, including our repatriation tax were made in the fourth quarter, whereas in 2024, these payments were made in the second quarter. The Horizon integration is progressing well, and we expect to reach $500 million in pretax synergies by year three post acquisition, with roughly 50% to be realized by the end of this year. We expect accretion to non-GAAP earnings per share in 2024. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. We're investing in the best innovation, both internally and externally to rapidly advance an innovative pipeline, multiple potentially first-in-class and/or best-in-class medicines across the four therapeutic areas. As I said earlier, this is reflected in our second quarter non-GAAP R&D spend of $1.4 billion, an increase of 30% year-over-year. Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth. We are expanding capacity in our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, including investments to support MariTide. Beyond manufacturing, we are opening a new global technology and innovation center in Hyderabad, India, which will attract talent at scale and accelerate digital capabilities across the organization, including artificial intelligence, data science, life science and medical. And third, we returned capital to shareholders as we paid competitive dividends of $2.25 per share in the second quarter. This represented a 6% increase compared to 2023. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2024 on Slide 29. We expect our 2024 total revenues in the range of $32.8 billion to $33.8 billion in non-GAAP earnings per share between $19.10 and $20.10. I will mention a few considerations as you model the remainder of 2024. On revenues, we expect mid-single-digit growth quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter compared to Q3. Our full year non-GAAP R&D expenses are now expected to increase more than 25% year-over-year as we further invest in our late-stage pipeline to support multiple late-stage studies underway across all therapeutic areas. As a result, we now project the full year non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 47% with Q3 operating margin lower than Q2. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter are expected to grow at a similar rate to the first two quarters of this year. We expect OI&E to be approximately $2.5 billion, which includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt raised for the Horizon acquisition. We continue to expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be in the 15% to 16% range, including the full year benefits associated with the inclusion of the Horizon business. As we have previously indicated, we have initiated activities to further expand MariTide manufacturing capacity. To support these initial efforts, we now expect capital expenditures of $1.3 billion in 2024 versus our most recent guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Our long-term outlook remains robust, and I am grateful to our 27,000-plus colleagues worldwide for their dedication to serve patients. This concludes our financial update. We will now begin our Q&A session. Julianne, please remind our participants of the process. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. Yaron Werber : Jay, maybe a question for you, actually. I want to start with the UPLIZNA. And we noticed a few things. The MINT study was supposed to have complete -- completion around mid-May. And Amgen just posted a whole bunch of new job postings for GMJ and you have a slot on October 15 at the MGFA to present the data. As you noted, you're doing steroid tapering. It's a different trial design but you also did steroid tapering and the other two indications, NMO and IgG4. Can you talk a little bit sort of what are you hoping to see and what are you expecting to see from the data? Jay Bradner : Thank you, Yaron, for the question, and for following the program so closely. we're Very excited about UPLIZNA, the CD19 B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody is showing really remarkable activity, the results in IgG4-related disease is a bellwether and is quite dramatic with a hazard ratio of 0.13, a P value of what, five to the minus seven. This was a stunning result and the first positive Phase III for patients with IgG4-related diseases. As you nicely picked up in your question, one of the opportunities of UPLIZNA is to get patients off steroids, and this is, therefore, a predefined ambition of UPLIZNA in both IgG4-related disease setting in that study as well, as in the generalized myasthenia gravis setting. Now these results won't be available until the second half of this year. And so I have no further update on that timing. But do stay tuned. We're so hopeful that this once every six months CD19 B-cell depleting therapy can differentiate substantially from available treatments like steroids and other B-cell targeting therapies and make a big difference for these patients. Operator : Our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter : Just following up here on Yaron, could you speak to the clinical bar for UPLIZNA and myasthenia gravis, both on a placebo-adjusted basis and also on an absolute basis, given the notable steroid taper, which I believe the other therapies did not have included in their design. And with regard to this MGFA scientific session meeting, should we expect top line results before that presentation? Jay Bradner : Thanks, Salveen. As I just mentioned to Yaron, we won't be providing further guidance on the timing of the results from the UPLIZNA study, the MINT study in myasthenia gravis of that you stay tuned. And as also, as shared knowing that patients with myasthenia gravis are repeatedly and over many, many months of treatment challenge by the requirement for persistent steroids, we built in a taper steroids on to this study. And these results to read out in the second half of this year will bring to light exactly how successful we are at liberating patients from steroids with every six months UPLIZNA. Operator : Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman : Well, not a huge growth driver. I'd love if you could characterize on some of your negotiations with CMS on Enbrel. Many of your peers are pleased with kind of the fair price that they negotiated with CMS. Do you feel the same way? I'd also love to know how you're seeing about the impact of Part D redesign? Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Evan, for the question. It's Murdo here. Overall, Enbrel continues to do well in the market despite a very competitive market in psoriatic arthritis and in rheumatoid arthritis. We also continue to have relatively stable volume despite all of the conversion that's going on in adalimumab with biosimilars. So we're quite pleased with prescribers adoption and continued value of Enbrel safety and tolerability, which is well established over a long period of time now in many, many years of experience. The process with CMS has concluded. We do have our price. I would just remind you that roughly 25% of Enbrel revenues come from Medicare Part D. So that will, in part, mitigate the impact of the CMS price reduction. And we continue to see that this is not a good mechanism to incentivize and reward innovation and it does not resemble one we've commonly described as a negotiation. So we've concluded that process. And we continue to look to help patients and support them with Enbrel in the market and we will watch the Part D redesign closely. We will look to see how PBMs redesign their formularies, and we will look to see how patients are impacted by the new model. While the cap may help, the out-of-pocket for many patients may actually rise. So we're watching it closely. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Yee from Jefferies. Mike Yee : Pivoting to obesity. I know that you are on track for data later this year for the injectable product, which you claim as differentiated as other competitors have moved quickly both with their programs with injectables but also oral multiple companies are putting off. Can you just comment about how you feel about your positioning in this space, given others have multiple products moving to late stage and how you feel you can position yourself here, given just 133. Jay Bradner : Thanks, Mike. Why don't I get started and Murdo, perhaps you could add on at the end. We are very pleased with the results that we've seen at the interim with the overall conduct of the Phase II study. Though there's been no further analysis since the interim, as of the interim all the arms were active, dropout had not been an issue. And we saw a differentiated profile with MariTide and remain confident that this medicine can address significant important unmet medical need in obesity, obesity-related conditions and, in particular, type 2 diabetes, as shared earlier in the call. There's no question that there is quite a democratized and broad base of innovation in this space. And potentially oral medicines could serve to address some of that still vast and remaining unmet need, and we follow these programs very closely. Still, the development of MariTide is advancing very briskly, as we now move to rapidly initiate a broad Phase III program. And we remain confident in what MariTide can offer for patients with obesity-related conditions as well as diabetes. Murdo? Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks, Jay. I think the data continue to emerge in the obesity and obesity-related conditions landscape, and show a clear benefit that reducing weight will indeed -- with GLP-1-based mechanisms will indeed improve outcomes in many disease settings. So that continues to expand the market and grow it. I do agree with Jay that there will be patients who may seek oral options but I continue to believe that we have a very good, differentiated product here and that monthly dosing or even less frequently will continue to help patients persist on their weight loss medication and achieve, hopefully, some of those hard endpoint risk reductions that we're seeing in clinical trial presentations. I would say that we would report that we have a really good convenient dosing here with a single-use pen that we're working on. And that weekly injectable products are probably more vulnerable to orals than a convenient monthly dosing. Operator : Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer Raffat : I wanted to focus on MariTide, if I may. A two-part question. First, it looks like your competitors are moving forward to Phase III on either smaller data sets or lesser further along from a Phase II, Phase III perspective. Just curious why you thought you definitely needed 52-week data? Was that mostly conservatism? Or is that some FDA feedback as well? And then also on CapEx, I feel like the $150 million guidance increase seems relatively trivial but it does imply CapEx being up 80% over first half. Could you please expand on whether it's API related or something else you have in mind? Jay Bradner : Yes. Thanks. Pete, why don't I start on the overall development plan for MariTide and the value of the Phase II data that we'll have at the end of this year. Umer, as you know, this medicine coming out of Phase I showed a quite remarkable impact on obesity with a dramatic reduction in BMI, actually proved quite durable after just three doses, MariTide in that Phase I study, we saw persistent weight loss really out 150 days or more at some doses. The Phase II study is a much larger concern. This is a 592 patient study. It has 11 arms, it has monthly or as Murdo said, even less frequent dosing. As a part two that allows us to really follow up on this durability signal, and it will allow the precision selection of dose or doses that patients and their practitioners really desire. This also confirms to regulatory requirements entering into Phase III. Peter Griffith : Umer, it's Peter on CapEx, as we previously indicated, we have initiated activities to further expand MariTide manufacturing capacity. So of course, those efforts, I said we now expect CapEx of $1.3 billion in '24 versus the most recent guidance, which was $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Operator : Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Congrats on all the progress, especially in your BiTE platform. Can you talk about any feedback you're getting from clinicians on the IMDELLTRA launch and potential lessons learned from BLINCYTO that you can leverage for IMDELLTRA, especially since you're launching BLINCYTO now in B-ALL and developing a subcu formulation? Bob Bradway : Take it in a couple of parts here. Murdo, do you want to share what we're learning from the launch? Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks for the question, Jay. Obviously, it's very early given that this was a mid-May approval but I have to say we are extremely pleased with how both thought leaders and community oncologists are receiving IMDELLTRA in the market. Their clinical conviction is very high. They are moving quickly to establish care pathways for these patients given the monitoring requirement for IMDELLTRA. And this is -- this disease setting, as you know, is a really difficult disease setting. Patients can progress relatively rapidly after platinum-based chemotherapy in the front line. And so we're obviously moving very quickly with our medical teams, our account management teams and our sales organization to build rapid awareness and to help both academic and community oncology accounts, be able to treat patients easily and safely and have the appropriate settings for care follow-up. So very early, but this product is seen as a major transformation in this disease setting. Jay? Jay Bradner : Yes. Thanks for the question, Jay. You picked up on something really interesting and that's leveraging the learnings of BLINCYTO. I mean this really is a platform capability that we enjoy with bispecific T-cell engagers. And already in the development of IMDELLTRA after its first approval, we are seeing significant readthrough of the BLINCYTO lessons, moving from later lines of therapy to earlier lines of therapy, to drive efficacy in the setting of reduced tumor burden. The utility of these medicines in combination, which is so much easier to access and assess than other complex modalities, say, like CAR-T and moving these medicines to the point of therapy where they can have the greatest impact, namely frontline, also pathways to reduce monitoring. Jay, we are leveraging all the learnings of BLINCYTO to drive and expedite the development of IMDELLTRA to be a component of frontline small cell lung cancer therapy, both with extensive stage and limited stage disease. And as Murdo shared, we do this work really quite inspired by the impact of the medicine, even so early in its launch, significant demand to learn and access and offer this medicine. Bob Bradway : And Jay, I'd just add that when it comes to xaluritamig, I think you're question applies well there, too. So stay tuned. We'll talk more about xaluritamig's data emerge but we're optimistic about how we can apply the lessons of BLIN and IMDELLTRA to that as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : I have a question for Jay. Again, on MariTide. Is there any reason to think that MariTide may or may not exhibit a different profile versus [indiscernible] on parameters such as lipid blood pressure or C-reactive protein? And how important is benefit on those parameters while you design your Phase III trial, something like outcomes trial or not? Jay Bradner : Yes. Thank you, Mohit. I can surely understand the interest. And indeed, we are making all these measurements and more. We won't dimensionalize what we mean when we say differentiated profile at this time. We're so focused on completing this ongoing and well-conducted MariTide Phase II study but do expect to learn and listen more when ultimately we're able to be in a position to share the outcomes of Part A of the Phase II study. We are taking a comprehensive assessment to optimize dose and schedule and impact of this medicine. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregory Renza from RBC Capital Markets. Gregory Renza : Congratulations on the quarter. My question is just on the obesity franchise. As you and the team had mentioned to expect one of the early obesity programs to enter clinical development later this year. Just curious if you could elaborate on what lens you're using to nominate that first or that next program? I'd imagine it's rather complex in the assessment and any color you have on determining that choice and how to take that forward, would be great. Jay Bradner : Gregory. Thank you. This is Jay, and thanks for following the early pipeline in its development. It's developing very nicely. As we've shared our strategy in the development of obesity medicines and medicines for obesity-related conditions. We're interested in really harvesting the insights of the incretin pathway but also moving beyond this pathway to other novel targets, some supported by genetic inferences but all of them supported by strong preclinical development packages. And so it is a multifactorial assessment that leads to the decision to resource the medicine in human clinical investigation. But it's a high degree of conviction that's required as the bars are ever rising within our portfolio for that resource as well as in the field. So more to follow on the mechanism and characteristics of this new medicine that we're intending to advance in the clinical investigation in the second half of this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Chris Raymond : And if I may, another obesity question. Just on MariTide, and I've heard you guys now talk for a long time about planning for a broad Phase III program. But I don't think you guys have ever talked even in generalities, when exactly this will happen. Can you maybe give a range here for when you anticipate kicking off enrollment in that program? Bob Bradway : Chris, as you can expect, we're focused now on completing the Phase II trial and moving as swiftly as appropriate into Phase III. So we'll have more to say that over the course of the coming year. You can appreciate it's a competitively intense field. So we're not giving dates at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter Gould : For Peter, on August 2, the U.S. Tax Court entered a decision against Coke. Their litigation was often referenced as sort of the best benchmark for sort of what you're facing. Appreciating that you took the deposit earlier this year but why shouldn't there be read through from that case? And maybe you could speak to your overall confidence in the outcome. Peter Griffith : No. Thank you very much for the question, Carter. Nothing has changed in our evaluation of the case. Court dates set for November 4. We're confident in our position, right, where we've always been. We're confident in our reserves are at an appropriate level. And -- what I would say is, first of all, I don't see -- and Coke hasn't been as much a reference and I won't get into making comparisons. We refer once in a while to the Medtronic situation. But in general, what we've seen is that the tax court in the last several years has reinforced the value of manufacturing down in Puerto Rico. And so we look forward to stating our case. We're very confident where we're at. And that's all we've got to say at this time. No change. We're at where we were in terms of confidence, which is in the same place for the last 2.5 or 3 years now. Operator : Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Peter, another one for you here. I appreciate the incremental guidance on CapEx, but just was wondering if you could speak directionally about margins in 2025, given the likely scope of the MariTide obesity program. Peter Griffith : Terence, we don't -- as you know, we don't guide long-term margins but let me just comment on what you're seeing this year. I'm happy to speak to that. And I think it's important. We're -- at Amgen, we're committed to a capital allocation hierarchy, where we first invest in innovation and first internal innovation. And so with that in mind, Terence, we've consistently said that we would flex out margin, which remember, with us, as a percentage of product sales, not revenue, if there were opportunities to achieve strong after-tax cash returns on our investment in excess of our hurdle rate. And then we would communicate that ahead of time. So this year, we shared with you at the beginning of the year, we felt operating margin to be about 48%. We see an opportunity here during the year to make some investments in the research and development activities with an emphasis, I would say, on development. That's up 30% year-over-year in the quarter, non-GAAP R&D. We now see non-GAAP R&D spend up over 25% year-over-year for '24, which we think is great because you've heard about the deep mid- and late-stage pipeline we have, driving MariTide in that deep mid- and late-stage pipeline. We're always focused Terence, whether it's this year or next year on productivity and prioritization, always looking for opportunities to generate capital to allocate the innovation. We've got a new program called technology and workforce strategy that we're moving along at speed and scale. I spoke about opening a new talent and innovation center in Hyderabad, India. So we are doing everything we can to preserve that margin, reallocate capital innovation and be the disciplined spenders of capital that Amgen always has been. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Just had a question on MariTide and your plans in that Phase II diabetes study. Company, obviously, very excited about the broader opportunity for the drug but it does seem like diabetes is a more established market with maybe less of the capacity constraints than we've see in obesity. So can you just talk a little bit about what you think you need to see to be able to compete here in dislodging [compens]. And can you also confirm that the study is not needed to move forward in the Phase III obesity studies, or it's just a completely separate program related to the diabetes piece of things? Bob Bradway : Can take this in two pieces again. Jay, why don't you address the first piece and then Murdo feel free to jump in. Jay Bradner : Yes, absolutely. As you nicely identified later this year, we will initiate an additional dedicated Phase II study that will characterize MariTide from the treatment of diabetes in patients with and without obesity. And this new study is not a gating step at all for the Phase III program for patients with obesity, but conforms to regulatory guidance and importantly, allows us to optimize dosing for the diabetic patients, where medically, I can say [indiscernible], your considerable perspective, I'm unaware of a highly efficacious monthly or less frequently administered medicine for the treatment of diabetes. Murdo? Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks, Jay. I would agree with you that the differentiation that we've talked about for chronic weight management would hold in a robust way in type 2 diabetes. And while there are lots of products that can control hyperglycemia and provided HbA1c control, there is a significant benefit if you can improve adherence and persistence. And we do believe that our monthly dosing could do that. Operator : Our next question comes from Kripa Devarakonda from Truist Securities. Kripa Devarakonda : Another obesity question but slightly tangential. I'm not sure if you've talked about this before but there's been a conversation about muscle preservation in people who are losing weight on glip. Have you evaluated this aspect with MariTide? Do you see this being the problem broadly in the space? And -- if so, where do you think MariTide would fit into that landscape? Bob Bradway : Sure. Jay, why don't you jump in there? Jay Bradner : Sure. No, thank you for your question. We -- as you apparently do as well, are following this class and class of medicines that provoke remarkable weight loss or the impact on healthy tissues, including but not limited to muscle, and the associated muscle loss that has been reported in the literature may relate mechanistically and may also relate to the quite dramatic cadence of weight loss of patients treated with these medicines. And in the fullness of time, we and others will have that answer. As you can imagine, we're making many of these measurements on our own study and don't have any report -- any data to report to you here today but we too are following this. And also the progress of some organizations that are seeking to administer medicine to support muscle loss with obesity medicines that is quite interesting to us given our legacy of muscle biology. But I would say these are early insights from the field. To my knowledge, they have not proven has yet to be debilitating to the patient but we like you follow with interest. Justin Claeys : Julianne saying we're getting to the top half of the hour here. Maybe we'll just take two more questions. Operator : Our next question comes from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. James Shin : For the next obesity asset that's entering clinics later this year, can you specify whether this asset is aimed to fill in for 786, and whether there's no next obesity asset will work in tandem with 133? Jay Bradner : Thanks, James. We won't today provide any further insight into this medicine. It's just too early. And as Bob shared, this is nicely for patients, a very competitive space. But as I shared earlier, in our deeper pipeline in obesity, we remain interested in the increasing pathway. We remain interested injectable. We're also pursuing oral medicines. And so in the fullness of time, we'll have a chance to share more. We're really playing the long game to drive true differentiation benefits to the patient and to access segments of the market that are not well addressed even by the current medicines. Operator : Our last question will come from Gary Nachman from Raymond James. Gary Nachman : So shifting to TEPEZZA. When do you think we'll see more of an acceleration in the low CAS patients? How has reimbursement been improving for those patients? And describe how much the Japanese opportunity could help next year? And then just talk about the overall resources you're putting behind TEPEZZA and the rest of the rare disease portfolio that obviously, a much bigger focus for you now, if that continues to ramp up at what pace and when you might get more operating leverage from that rare disease business? Bob Bradway : A lot of questions there, Gary, but why don't we take it in a couple of pieces. Go ahead, Vikram. Vikram Karnani : Yes. So thanks for the question, Gary. Look, we're pretty pleased with how we've been executing on TEPEZZA this year and driving it towards growth. As you rightly observed, there are a significant number of low CAS patients or low clinical activity score patients that are suffering from this disease who are not being appropriately treated. And specifically, that's about 80,000 out of the 100,000 addressable patients in the U.S. What we have been doing is seeing significant momentum on expanding our prescriber base, which now in addition to oculoplastic surgeons also includes ophthalmologists and endocrinologists. And this is a really important element here. The strategic focus in endocrinology is really important so that we can serve those low C-A-S patients, the low CAS patients favorably. You asked about improving access. To date, we have achieved favorable medical policy changes for greater than 65% of U.S. covered lives. And if you compare that to 50% last quarter and just over 5% about a year ago, I think we've made pretty good progress in enabling patient access using our Phase IV data that have become available last year. So we continue to see a significant growth opportunity for TEPEZZA in the U.S. while also recognizing that as we make progress with a lot of our execution efforts, there continues to be a time lag between when we knock down barriers for access, expand our prescriber base and see patients get on therapy. Bob Bradway : In Japan, Gary, we expect that they'll be, again, an attractive market and this will be well received in that country, and we'll talk about that once we've launched there during the course of next year. With respect to leverage, I think I would just offer that we're on track. With respect to our synergy targets there, and we'll begin to get even more leverage as we're able to take full control of the supply chain for the rare disease products. And then I would just further observe, as we've said many times, that feel fortunate that there's a good overlap between some of our existing capabilities in sales and marketing and the needs of those rare disease products. So all in all, we remain really excited about what we're able to do for rare disease patients, the position we have and the likelihood of that just improving over time. So with that, let me thank all of you. I know we've gone a few minutes over the set time but thank you all for participating in the call, and we look forward to regrouping with you after the third quarter. Thanks.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : My name is Julianne, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at conclusion of the last speakers\u2019 prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Justin Claeys, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Claeys, you may now begin. Justin Claeys : Thank you, Julianne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Murdo Gordon, Vikram Karnani, Jay Bradner and Peter Griffith. Through the course of our discussion today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and have provided appropriate reconciliations within the materials that accompany this call. We will also make some forward-looking statements, which are qualified by our safe harbor statement, and please note that actual results can vary materially. Over to you, Bob. Robert Bradway : Thank you for joining us today. Our performance this quarter reflects the strength of our business across our core therapeutic areas and geographies. Our in-market medicines performed well in the quarter with third quarter revenues up 23% to $8.5 billion and 10 of our products delivering double-digit or better sales growth. We're also rapidly advancing our pipeline with a significant number of potentially first-in-class or best-in-class medicines, positioning us for long-term growth. Let me address MariTide directly. Our ongoing Phase II study is progressing well, and we look forward to sharing results later this year. We're well advanced in preparing to launch a broad Phase III program for MariTide, including obesity, obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes. You may have noted that we recently initiated a Phase II study in patients with type 2 diabetes. As we shared after the interim analysis, we're confident that MariTide's differentiated profile will address important unmet medical needs across a number of diseases, including type 2 diabetes. Beyond obesity, we have momentum across each of our therapeutic areas, and I'll start with oncology. In the third quarter, we saw strong in-market performance with 17% sales growth across the innovative oncology portfolio and several products experienced double-digit growth, including BLINCYTO, which, of course, is our first bispecific T cell engager or BiTE, which is now established as the standard of care in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The launch of our next BiTE IMDELLTRA is also progressing well with strong clinical conviction and three Phase III studies underway in small cell lung cancer. And further demonstrating the strength and promise of this platform in solid tumors, we're pleased to announce today that we will advance xaluritamig into Phase III clinical development in advanced prostate cancer in the fourth quarter. Let me remind you to also keep an eye out for Phase III bemarituzumab data in gastric cancer, which we should have in the next few months. Our rare disease portfolio delivered $1.2 billion of sales in the quarter, growing 21% year-over-year, driven by TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA, UPLIZNA and TAVNEOS. These medicines are highly innovative, are still in the early stages of their life cycles and have significant upside potential, including expansion into new indications and geographies. For example, TEPEZZA was recently approved in Japan. Also in rare disease, UPLIZNA demonstrated compelling data in generalized myasthenia gravis and was granted breakthrough therapy designation in IgG4-related diseases. We're excited about the promise of inebilizumab in these settings and potentially in other B cell mediated autoimmune diseases. In inflammation, TEZSPIRE continues its strong trajectory with 67% growth year-over-year in the quarter. We're further encouraged by the potential of TEZSPIRE in COPD and additional indications that we're also actively exploring. And finally, in General Medicine, Repatha and EVENITY are each delivering strong volume growth again this quarter. These products are pivotal as we continue to serve more patients and meet the growing demand for therapies that address some of the most serious health challenges worldwide, like heart disease and osteoporosis. Looking ahead, we remain confident that Amgen is well positioned to deliver long-term growth and innovation across each of our therapeutic areas. Our balanced portfolio, combined with the strength of our pipeline, we think will continue to drive our business forward. As always, I'd like to thank my colleagues across Amgen for their unwavering commitment to patients. And I want to now turn the call over to Murdo. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Bob. Execution was strong across our core therapeutic areas in the third quarter, driving 24% year-over-year product sales growth. Each of our regions delivered double-digit volume growth. And sales of 10 products grew by double-digits or better, including Repatha, TEZSPIRE, BLINCYTO, EVENITY and TAVNEOS, all brands that are important to our future growth trajectory. Starting with our general medicine portfolio, sales of Repatha, EVENITY and Prolia collectively grew 18% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by volume growth. We serve large patient populations with these therapies. For example, we expect Repatha and Prolia alone will help over 11 million patients in 2024. Repatha sales increased 40% year-over-year to $567 million for the third quarter, now annualizing at over $2 billion in sales. In the quarter, we saw year-over-year volume growth of 41% and favorable changes to estimated sales deductions of 8%, partially offset by lower net selling price of 10%. In the U.S., our expanded primary care field force efforts drove a 50% year-over-year increase in primary care physician prescribers. U.S. volume growth was enabled by broad reimbursement and removal of prior authorization requirements by several payers. Outside the U.S., Repatha retains category leadership and continues to grow across major markets despite increased competition in the segment. EVENITY sales increased 30% year-over-year to almost $400 million for the third quarter. In the U.S., EVENITY continues to be the segment leader with 61% of the bone builder market. Strong U.S. volume growth was supported by an increase in prescription volume from both established and new EVENITY prescribers with a 34% quarter-over-quarter increase in new provider accounts ordering EVENITY. In Japan, EVENITY continues to hold a leading position with 47% of the bone builder segment. Since launching in Japan in 2019, EVENITY has been prescribed to approximately 600,000 patients. EVENITY sales are now annualizing at approximately $1.5 billion. We're encouraged by the growth momentum we are driving and have conviction in the potential for EVENITY to help the many more women globally who remain at risk of a fracture due to their post-menopausal osteoporosis. Prolia sales increased 6% year-over-year to $1 billion for the third quarter, driven by 9% volume growth. In the U.S., we see broad prescribing base with more than 13,000 provider accounts using Prolia so far this year. In inflammation, TEZSPIRE continues its strong trajectory with $269 million in sales in the third quarter. Sales increased 67% year-over-year, supported by TEZSPIRE's uniquely differentiated profile and increased adoption by pulmonologists. We're encouraged by the growth of TEZSPIRE to date and its potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe uncontrolled asthma. Otezla sales decreased 1% year-over-year for the third quarter with 5% volume growth. This volume growth was offset by 7% lower net selling price. Otezla remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well positioned to help the more than 1.5 million systemic treatment-naive U.S. patients with milder psoriasis who cannot be optimally addressed by a topical treatment. Enbrel sales decreased 20% year-over-year for the third quarter, primarily driven by 13% unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and 12% lower net selling price. Volumes grew 4% in the quarter. Going forward, we expect continued declining net selling price, relatively stable volume, providing strong cash flow for our business. Sales of our biosimilar products increased 9% year-over-year in the third quarter. We have fully deployed our team in support of the recent U.S. launch of PAVBLU, a biosimilar to EYLEA. Our teams moved quickly to engage retina specialists, and we're encouraged by the enthusiastic feedback from customers. Our teams are also ready for the upcoming U.S. launches of WEZLANA, a biosimilar to STELARA and BEKEMV, a biosimilar to Solaris, expected in the first and second quarters of 2025, respectively. Overall, our biosimilars portfolio continues to deliver attractive returns driven by our efficient business model. In oncology, sales of our seven innovative products, BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate, XGEVA and IMDELLTRA grew 17% year-over-year for the third quarter, driven by volume growth and higher net selling price. In total, these products contributed over $2 billion of sales in the third quarter. BLINCYTO sales grew 49% year-over-year to $327 million for the third quarter. Growth was supported by the recent expansion of the BLINCYTO label, now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell ALL in the consolidation phase regardless of measurable residual disease status. Our U.S. launch of IMDELLTRA is progressing well, generating $36 million of sales in the third quarter. There's strong clinical conviction in both academic and community settings, driven by IMDELLTRA's breakthrough efficacy. We have a strong sense of urgency to bring IMDELLTRA to patients living with this aggressive disease. LUMAKRAS sales increased 88% year-over-year to $98 million for the third quarter. Vectibix sales increased 12% year-over-year to $282 million for the third quarter, now annualizing at over $1 billion. And KYPROLIS grew 8% year-over-year to $378 million in the quarter. Nplate sales increased 9% to $456 million for the third quarter. If we exclude government sales, Nplate sales grew 18% year-over-year for the third quarter, driven by 14% volume growth and higher net selling price. We've made significant progress in this quarter, driving execution and accelerating performance of our most important growth brands. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram, who will cover our rare disease portfolio. Vikram Karnani : Thank you, Murdo. I am pleased to provide an update on rare disease, which delivered product sales of $1.2 billion in Q3. Beginning with TEPEZZA for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, third quarter sales were $488 million, reflecting growth of 8% year-over-year when compared to results from the legacy Horizon business. Recall, there are roughly 100,000 TED patients in the U.S. and penetration is currently only in the single digits. We are excited about the growth opportunity presented by the roughly 80% of TED patients who have a lower clinical activity score, or CAS. As we have discussed previously, to more effectively reach these patients, we have recently reorganized and expanded our field force into two separate and dedicated teams, one focused on comprehensive ophthalmologists and ocular specialists and the other focused on endocrinologists. This approach reflects an optimized footprint to continue to serve patients with high CAS disease while expanding our reach to those patients with low CAS disease who can benefit from TEPEZZA. We made this change in the third quarter. And over the last few weeks, these teams have been actively focused on establishing new relationships with potential new prescribers. We expect this optimized focus to gain traction over the next few quarters as physicians become more experienced identifying the right patients for treatment and navigating the reimbursement process to enable access to TEPEZZA. Following our 8% year-over-year growth this quarter, we remain confident in the long-term potential for TEPEZZA in the U.S. as we expand our reach to patients with low CAS disease and continue to work closely with payers to expand access. International expansion remains a key growth opportunity with regulatory filings completed or in progress across multiple regions. TEPEZZA's approval in Japan in September marked a key milestone ahead of its launch, which is expected by early 2025. We also initiated a Phase III subcutaneous study and see this as an opportunity to increase adoption and improve the patient experience with an alternative option to our current IV formulation. KRYSTEXXA for patients with chronic refractory gout delivered $310 million in sales in Q3, representing 23% year-over-year growth driven by volume growth from strong commercial execution. KRYSTEXXA with immunomodulation has established a new standard of care for chronic refractory gout. UPLIZNA for patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, or NMOSD, delivered $106 million in sales in Q3, representing 58% year-over-year growth. International expansion of UPLIZNA is also underway with launches in multiple markets, including Canada, which launched earlier this year. Additionally, we're excited by the growth potential of UPLIZNA driven by the striking data in both IgG4-related disease, which affects over 20,000 patients in the U.S. and generalized myasthenia gravis or gMG, which affects nearly 80,000 to 100,000 patients in the U.S. Sales of TAVNEOS were $80 million for the third quarter. Sales increased 116% year-over-year, driven by volume growth. In the U.S., more than 4,300 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis have been treated with TAVNEOS. Over 2,600 health care professionals have now prescribed TAVNEOS, a roughly 53% increase in the prescriber base so far this year. As we reflect on the past year, it's clear how far we've come in the integration and how well we're progressing. I want to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to all the team members that are working tirelessly to serve the needs of patients suffering from rare diseases. Looking ahead, we're excited about the opportunities and confident in what we'll achieve in our rare disease business and beyond. Now I'll hand it over to Jay for our R&D update. James Bradner : Thank you, Vikram, and good afternoon, everyone. In the third quarter, we made significant progress advancing our broad clinical pipeline, which includes a number of potentially first-in-class or best-in-class therapies. Since our last update, we have initiated a Phase II study of MariTide in type 2 diabetes and delivered positive potentially practice changing Phase III data with UPLIZNA in generalized myasthenia gravis. Additionally, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for UPLIZNA in IgG4-related diseases underscoring the important potential impact of this medicine. We also showcased promising data from several oncology programs at major medical conferences, including IMDELLTRA, xaluritamig and AMG 193, while reporting positive results from the first of eight Phase III studies evaluating rocatinlimab in atopic dermatitis. Let's begin with general medicine. As previously mentioned, based upon the interim analysis of the ongoing Phase II study of MariTide in chronic weight management, we are seeing a differentiated profile and are confident MariTide will address important unmet medical needs in obesity, obesity-related conditions in type 2 diabetes. We remain on track and look forward to top line 52-week data from the MariTide Phase II study in late 2024. We are actively planning and expect to initiate a broad Phase III program in obesity, obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes. This quarter, we initiated a dedicated Phase II trial investigating MariTide in patients with type 2 diabetes, living with and without obesity. MariTide has the potential to be the first therapy in this setting with monthly or even less frequent dosing. Beyond MariTide, our Phase I trial of AMG 513 is actively enrolling patients. We also continue to advance our preclinical obesity programs, which include both oral and injectable approaches comprising both incretin and non-incretin mechanisms. Also in general medicine is olpasiran, our potentially best-in-class LP(a) targeting small interfering RNA medicine. The fully enrolled Phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial of olpasiran continues to progress. In oncology, IMDELLTRA, a first-in-class bispecific T cell engager or BiTE molecule, targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer is rapidly advancing into earlier lines of therapy with three Phase III studies underway in both extensive stage and limited stage disease. To further enhance the patient experience, we are evaluating reduced monitoring protocols as part of the Phase III program, and we have initiated a Phase Ib study evaluating subcutaneous tarlatamab in patients with second line or later extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. In September, we presented impressive follow-up data from our DeLLphi 301 Phase II study of IMDELLTRA in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer, demonstrating sustained anticancer activity and a manageable safety profile. We also presented data from DeLLphi 303, the Phase Ib study of IMDELLTRA combined with a PD-L1 inhibitor as maintenance therapy following four cycles of chemotherapy and first-line extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. This design is similar to our ongoing Phase III study, DeLLphi 305, which test the efficacy of IMDELLTRA and PD-L1 inhibition versus PD-L1 inhibition alone, in first-line extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, following platinum-based chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 10 months, IMDELLTRA has demonstrated a manageable safety profile, median duration of disease control of 9.3 months, median progression-free survival of 5.6 months and a nine month estimated overall survival of 89%. Moving to our first-in-class STEAP1 CD3 bispecific molecule, xaluritamig, we are pleased to announce that following consultation with regulatory authorities, we will initiate a Phase III study in post-taxane metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC, this quarter. The promise of xaluritamig was recently evidenced by data presented in September from a Phase I dose exploration cohort evaluating monotherapy in patients with mCRPC. With a median follow-up of 27.9 months, the median overall survival was 17.7 months across all cohorts, a potential improvement upon the historical median survival of 12 to 15 months in this patient population. Additional data from a Phase I randomized dose expansion and optimization cohort has identified the recommended dose and schedule for Phase III clinical investigation. Additionally, we are studying xaluritamig in earlier lines of therapy in combination and in earlier stages of prostate cancer. Our Phase I study of xaluritamig in combination with enzalutamide and abiraterone is ongoing. Recently, we have initiated two additional Phase Ib studies investigating xaluritamig in the upfront management of more localized disease. The first study evaluates neoadjuvant xaluritamig therapy that is prior to radical prostatectomy in patients with newly diagnosed, localized, intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer. The second study evaluates xaluritamig in high-risk non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer after definitive therapy. We are particularly excited about the potential of xaluritamig, now our third bispecific T cell engager entering late-stage clinical development. Beyond our T cell engagers, we have completed enrollment of FORTITUDE-102, a Phase III study of bemarituzumab, our first-in-class fibroblast growth factor receptor IIb directed monoclonal antibody combined with chemotherapy and nivolumab in first-line gastric cancer. In the coming months, we expect to read out the results of FORTITUDE-101, a Phase III study of bemarituzumab combined with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in first-line gastric cancer. This study was designed based on the successful Phase II FIGHT study, which reported numerically longer progression-free survival and overall survival. Lastly, we are also rapidly advancing AMG 193, our oral PRMT5 inhibitor developed for MTAP-null solid tumors. We recently initiated a Phase II study of AMG 193 in patients with MTAP-null previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This study will help to address regulatory agency requirements for dose optimization and selection. In September, we presented encouraging data from a Phase I dose escalation and initial dose expansion study, demonstrating promising monotherapy activity and an acceptable safety profile. Turning to inflammation. Based upon encouraging Phase II data from TEZSPIRE in patients with COPD, we are planning to initiate Phase III studies in collaboration with AstraZeneca. These trials will target patients with moderate to very severe COPD with blood eosinophil counts greater than or equal to 150 cells per microliter. We expect to begin enrollment in the first half of 2025. TEZSPIRE is also being investigated in separate Phase III studies of patients with eosinophilic esophagitis and in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where top line data are expected later this year. In September, we announced positive results from the Phase III Horizon study of rocatinlimab in atopic dermatitis. The study met its co-primary endpoints and all key secondary endpoints. We anticipate additional data readouts from the ROCKET program will deepen our understanding of rocatinlimab profile. Beyond atopic dermatitis, we continue to explore rocatinlimab in moderate to severe asthma and prurigo nodularis. To expand the impact of our CD19 directed therapeutics for even more patients suffering from serious inflammatory diseases, we have initiated Phase II studies of blinatumomab our CD19 targeting BiTE molecule approved as BLINCYTO and inebilizumab, our CD19 targeting monoclonal antibody approved as UPLIZNA. These studies build on mounting evidence of therapeutic benefit for B-cell depletion in autoimmune diseases from small investigator-sponsored trials of blinatumomab in systemic sclerosis and refractory rheumatoid arthritis. Our initial focus will be on systemic lupus erythematosus with nephritis with plans to expand into additional indications. Shifting to rare disease. We recently presented potentially practice-changing results from the Phase III MINT study, the largest placebo-controlled trial for a biologic therapy in generalized myothenia gravis. MINT evaluated UPLIZNA in both acetylcholine receptor autoantibody positive ACHR positive and muscle-specific kinase autoantibody positive or MuSK-positive populations. At the reported 26-week time point, UPLIZNA demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in the myasthenia gravis activities of daily living score after just two doses compared to placebo. This efficacy was observed in the combined ACHR and MuSK-positive populations as well as in each population separately. UPLIZNA also achieved statistically significant improvements in the quantitative myasthenia gravis score, compared to placebo at week 26 in the combined populations. Importantly, in the MINT study, patients taking corticosteroids were tapered down starting at week 4 to a 5-milligram per day dose by week 24. MINT is the first and only Phase III placebo-controlled myasthenia gravis trial for a biologic that tapered corticosteroid use. As such, the efficacy observed with UPLIZNA in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis offers a chance for meaningful benefit without the burden and toxicity of chronic steroid use. We look forward to 52-week data for the ACHR positive cohort and results from both ACHR positive and MuSK-positive patient populations. In the open-label period of the MINT study, where UPLIZNA has the potential to demonstrate durable efficacy. Moving beyond generalized myasthenia gravis in August, the FDA granted UPLIZNA Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related diseases, or IgG4-related disease based upon data from the Phase III MITIGATE study. This data will be presented at the American College of Rheumatology Conference in November. We are extremely encouraged by the potential of UPLIZNA in both myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease and are actively working to file these data with regulatory authorities. In closing, I want to thank my Amgen colleagues for their unwavering commitment to patients facing grievous illnesses for the focus and for the collaboration during this productive year. I'll now turn it over to Peter for the financial update. Peter Griffith : Thank you, Jay. We're pleased with our strong third quarter performance and are on track with our 2024 full year goals and long-term objectives. We have a strong long-term growth outlook with breadth and depth across each of our four therapeutic areas, including our innovative pipeline and in-market products, serving patients with serious illnesses around the globe. We will continue to allocate capital to innovation first and with our strong cash flows, also intend to fund our other capital allocation priorities. Starting with our third quarter results as shown on Slide 28 of the slide deck, we delivered $8.5 billion in total revenues, a 23% year-over-year increase. Excluding the addition of Horizon, product sales increased 8% year-over-year, driven by 12% volume growth. In the U.S., our sales in the quarter were impacted by $173 million and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. In the third quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 49.6% as a percentage of product sales with total non-GAAP operating expenses increasing 27% year-over-year, largely driven by the addition of Horizon. Non-GAAP R&D spending in the third quarter increased 35% year-over-year to $1.4 billion as we invested in the rapidly advancing late-stage pipeline including MariTide, bemarituzumab and olpasiran as well as Horizon acquired programs. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 21% year-over-year, primarily driven by the addition of Horizon, excluding the addition of Horizon, non-GAAP SG&A expenses were relatively flat year-over-year. The Horizon integration is progressing well, and we expect to reach $500 million in pretax cost synergies by year three post-acquisition with more than 50% to be realized by the end of this year. The acquisition is accretive to non-GAAP EPS year-to-date, and we expect it to be for the full year as well. Our non-GAAP OI&E resulted in a $554 million expense, up $329 million year-over-year, almost entirely due to increased interest expense from the Horizon acquisition. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet with $2.5 billion of debt retired in the third quarter and expect to return to our pre-Horizon acquisition capital structure by the end of 2025. Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased 2.7 percentage points year-over-year to 13.4%, primarily due to the change in earnings mix from the inclusion of Horizon. In the third quarter of 2024, the company generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow, an increase of $2.5 billion from the previous year. Our strong cash flows enable investing in our business for long-term growth, including advancing our exciting pipeline opportunities and expanding capacity in our state-of-the-art manufacturing processes and facilities. Our past investments enable us to serve a significant number of patients today. For example, with over 43 million units expected for Repatha and Prolia alone in 2024, ongoing and future investments will support MariTide and other products across the portfolio. In addition, we returned capital to shareholders as we paid competitive dividend of $2.25 per share in the second quarter, this represented a 6% increase compared to 2023. Let's turn to the outlook for the business for 2024 on Slide 30. We expect our 2024 total revenues in the range of $33.0 billion to $33.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS between $19.20 to $20. We do expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS to be lower than Q3 non-GAAP EPS, because of planned investment increases in our business, including key assets in our innovative pipeline beginning with MariTide and olpasiran and other strategic business investments. This sequential pattern is consistent with historical trends. Let me mention a few consideration as you model the remainder of 2024. We now project full year new asset sales at approximately $400 million and other revenue at approximately $1.4 billion. We expect TEPEZZA sales in Q4 to be flat to slightly down versus the third quarter, resulting in full year sales being up roughly 5% year-over-year as compared to the full year of TEPEZZA sales in 2023. Consistent with prior years, we expect Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses to be the highest of the year and expect approximately 28% of our full year operating expenses to be in the fourth quarter. This includes additional investments to drive momentum into 2025, for example, in key brands like Repatha and EVENITY. For the full year, our total non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow approximately 25% year-over-year, including from the addition of Horizon. We still expect full year non-GAAP R&D growth of more than 25% year-over-year. We now expect OI&E to be approximately $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion, which includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt raised for the Horizon acquisition. We now expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be in the 14% to 15% range, including the full year benefits associated with the inclusion of the Horizon business and favorable items in the quarter identified in the return to provision process. Finally, our capital expenditure guidance remains at $1.3 billion for 2024. Our long-term growth outlook remains strong and I'm grateful to our colleagues worldwide for their dedication to serving patients. This concludes our financial update. I'll now hand it back to Bob for our Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Robert Bradway : Thank you, Julianne. Sorry, go ahead. Operator : Our first question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Salveen Richter : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. The Phase II MariTide data clearly remains the key update into year-end. Can you help us understand what you will share with regard to this update in terms of actual data and also the Phase III developmental plan and timelines and when we might get an update from the other obesity programs? Thank you. Robert Bradway : Okay. It sounded like a few questions there, Salveen. As we said, we're continuing to be very excited about the prospects for MariTide, and we added the disclosure on this call that we have begun the Phase II study in type 2 diabetes. The conduct of the trial is continuing to progress well, and we're expecting to have the data here by the end of the year. And when we have those data, we'll obviously look forward to being able to share that with our investors. Justin Claeys : Julianne, let\u2019s go to the next question, please. Operator : Thank you, Salveen. Our next question comes from Olivia Brayer from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Olivia Brayer : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. You are getting a lot closer to kicking off a Phase III MariTide program. So how do you think about the level of spend that will go into that kind of undertaking? I mean I assume we're looking at billions as it relates to investments just around R&D, but also manufacturing. But yes, hoping you guys can put some numbers around it or at least better characterize how you're thinking about things from here. Also hoping you can clarify whether or not you have seen those Phase II data in-house? Robert Bradway : So with respect to the Phase III trial, we would reiterate that we are expecting to pursue a broad Phase III trial in obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes. It will be, we would expect a large global trial, fully exploring the molecule. And Jay, I'd invite you to add any color you'd like about the Phase III program. But obviously, our investment will reflect our view that this is a differentiated molecule, and we look forward to having the full characterization of its safety and efficacy profile. James Bradner : Yeah. Thanks, Bob. We're fully on track actively planning and expect to initiate a broad Phase III program. This will include obesity, obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes, as you've heard already, we're progressing the Phase II study to characterize dose response, tolerability efficacy in patients. Importantly, without obesity but having type 2 diabetes. So we're fully on track, actively planning the broad program. Robert Bradway : And we'll -- as part of our normal guidance process in the coming year, I'm sure we'll give an updated perspective then that reflects our plans for the Phase III trial. And then we'll also add any perspective that may be helpful on the capital expenditure front. I think what I just would remind you is that this molecule is designed on our existing antibody platform. It fits very well with our network as currently configured. And so again, we'll have more to say about that through time as necessary. Peter Griffith : Maybe to suggest, Bob -- Olivia, it's Peter here. I would just remind you of Amgen's long history of being a leader in the science and manufacturing and process development that creates opportunities in terms of how we might view yield going forward. So while it might not just be bricks, mortar and steel, yield is really important, and we've got a really strong history in that. And we did raise the CapEx guide this year, as you know, to about $1.3 billion. We're very thoughtful about that. And you also heard me mention that research and development spend up 35% quarter-over-quarter to the prior year. We expect it to be up over 25% for the year. So we certainly are investing where we always say we will in innovation and MariTide is right at the front of that, and we look forward to investing to be a key player in this global public health crisis. Justin Claeys : Julliane, let\u2019s take the next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Olivia. Our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Yee : Great. Thanks so much. Maybe for Jay, it sounds like you guys are quite confident about MariTide, and yet you are also building a greater portfolio I think you announced 513. And yet you also don't have an oral, I don't believe so. Can you just comment about your philosophy or thinking about the totality of the portfolio given 133 is so far in the Phase III, but the other things are so early, and whether you believe you have the portfolio today to be competitive with everybody else who have so many things at late stage? Thank you. James Bradner : Thanks, Mike. I really appreciate the question. With MariTide, we're really pleased with the execution of the study await data later this year, fully focused as I shared on setting up the broad Phase III program. The development of additional medicines for obesity and obesity-related conditions is a source of really active investigation here, preclinically and clinically now with 513 as you nicely mentioned. We've not as yet disclosed the mechanism of action of 513, which is a very interesting program. And as you note, and this is on clinicaltrials.gov, the SAD/MAD ascending dose study has been announced is enrolling and feature subcutaneous or intravenous administration. To reach smaller segments, other segments within the obesity landscape to serve all the patients with obesity and it's related conditions. We, like many others, are interested in both injectable as well as oral non-injectable medicines. We're very interested in incretin pathway as well as non incretin pathway mechanisms of action, and our portfolio reflects each of these. Justin Claeys : Julliane, next question, please. Operator : Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Courtney Breen : Thank you so much for the question today. Just anchoring on some of the conversations that you shared around the Horizon products and specifically TEPEZZA. Can you please provide some more context on the path to growth and when you expect to see the impact of the sales team there, particularly in the context of the final comments that we shared in terms of expectations for Q4 relative to Q3. Robert Bradway : Yeah. Let's take it in a couple of pieces. First, as you heard us say, the quarter grew 8%. Vikram, why don't you just remind our investors of the plans for expanding Salesforce and then also perhaps speak to Japan or international more general? Vikram Karnani : Yeah. Thanks, Bob. So as Bob just said and as I said in my prepared remarks, TEPEZZA grew 8% year-over-year. And as we have also said previously, we're continuing to focus on growth coming not only from the high CAS patients, but also the 80,000 -- roughly 80,000 patients that suffer from low CAS disease. What we have learned over our time serving these patients and these prescribers is that in order to most effectively reach these low CAS patients, we need to have a dedicated effort towards both comprehensive ophthalmologists and ocular specialists -- as well as endocrinologists. And what we have found is that type of coverage is necessary in order to serve the 80,000 or so low CAS disease patients that we have discussed previously. This approach reflects an optimized footprint. We believe that this approach will allow us to not only help the right physicians and new prescribers find the right patients for TEPEZZA, but also help to enable access to TEPEZZA the most appropriate way. Finally, what I would say here is we -- this is something that has been -- we've been working on for a little bit here. And this change occurred in the third quarter. So we do expect the momentum to play out here in the next several quarters. In the last few weeks, the teams have been actively focused on establishing new relationships with these new prescribers, and we look forward to updating you as we go. Final point on the global aspects of TEPEZZA. As you're aware, beyond the U.S., we are also looking forward to bringing to TEPEZZA to patients around the globe, including Japan. Japan is a really important country for us in terms of our next launch. Let me remind you that we received approval in Japan for TEPEZZA with high CAS patients in September, and we're actively working to an early 2025 launch there as well. Justin Claeys : Julianne, next question, please. Operator : Thank you, Courtney. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Umer Raffat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a two part question on MariTide, if I may. Perhaps, first, from a vomiting profile perspective, I recall in the Phase I trial, specifically in Phase I, the vomiting profile was generally fairly consistent between low and high doses, which would imply perhaps titration in and of itself may not solve for vomiting. But Jay, I'm curious, is there anything super important in the design of Phase I which wasn't incorporated that could have addressed that vomiting. That's number one. And then secondly, on the cadence of weight loss, is there any reason to expect the plateau in weight loss to not happen before -- do not happen past month seven or so because we've seen other GLP trials kind of do that in six to seven months post titration. Thank you very much. James Bradner : Yeah. Thanks, Umer. I really appreciate it. The Phase I study published now in January has been pretty thoroughly considered. This was a standard Phase I dose escalation study that did not have antecedent dose titration. So if that answers your question, I suppose there's only so much that can be learned from the Phase I. We're honestly just really focused on these Phase II data, where at the interim, we saw the differentiated profile. And as you know, we're in Phase III planning. Regarding weight loss plateau, this will be an interesting thing to observe and learn from the data, which we wait later this year. Justin Claeys : All right. Julianne, next question, please. Operator : Thank you, Umer. Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jay Olson : Congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking the question. Maybe I'll shift gears to oncology. Congrats on all the progress and impressive growth, especially for BLINCYTO. For subcu BLINCYTO, it looks like the registrational study is now going to initiate in the second half of next year. Can you talk about what may have changed there and maybe share some color on the plans for that study? Thank you. James Bradner : Yeah. Thanks, Jay. This is Jay. The subcutaneous development of BLINCYTO is a major priority for us. We're very encouraged by the efficacy that we've seen with subcutaneous BLINCYTO in prior studies. You'll remember perhaps that this medicine is dosed 3 times a week. We did a Phase I study back in 2022 at ASH with striking data, among 21 evaluable patients, we saw 67% CR rate within one cycle. There's been further data in the American Journal of Hematology since that time, 27 patients with an 85% CR rate, 75% of whom were MRD negative. And this is all without any grade for CRS. So subcutaneous BLINCYTO was a major priority for us. It is progressing in clinical investigation. And there's really nothing to read into the timing that you allude to in your excellent question. Thank you. Justin Claeys : All right. Julianne, next question, please. Operator : Thank you, Jay. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Terence Flynn : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two part on MariTide as well. Just wondering if you can confirm if the data disclosure will be a press release or it will be at a conference. I think the Phase I data were presented at the insulin resistance conference in December. So just wondering the venue. And then for the Phase III, Jay, do you think you're going to have to make any changes to the titration schedule you employed in Phase II? I know Lilly had extended their tirzepatide titration schedule when they move from Phase II to Phase III. Do you think that's something that could be necessary here? Thank you. Robert Bradway : In terms of the release, Terence and how we share that with investors. Well, again, we're focused on getting the data in hand and when we have them, we'll try to do whatever in best interest of the shareholders. So stay tuned as soon as we have them. We look forward to being able to report those. And Jay, do you want to address the question on Phase III? James Bradner : The Phase III planning, as we've shared, is fully on track, and we won't today give any news or insights into our approach to dosing, but we feel confident it will be well informed by the Phase II study that is ongoing, and we'll read out later this year. Justin Claeys : Next question, please, Julianne. Operator : Thank you, Terence. Our next question comes from Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Carter Gould : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I want to maybe switch it up a little bit and ask you around the PAVBLU launch. Amgen's biosimilars have some have gone really well, others a little bit less so. You've historically talked about the importance of being first. But how do you think about adoption ahead of a Q code and in discussions with any payers, your expectation or step edits for biosimilars ahead of some of the other newer entrants? Thanks. Robert Bradway : Yeah. Thanks, Carter. Murdo, why don't you share your thoughts in general on the biosimilar franchise. We don't often get a chance to talk about it, but please also on PAVBLU. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Bob. We're obviously quite excited about the next wave of launch is not just PAVBLU, but our other biosimilar launches that we are expecting in the not-too-distant future, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, with WEZLANA and BEKEMV. On PAVBLU, as you mentioned, Carter, it's important to be first or in the first wave. And clearly, we're in that position now as we're launching this product as we speak. And we expect there to be strong interest in PAVBLU pretty much early on in the launch phase. Obviously, having permanent Q codes in this case, given that it's biosimilar are important, but there's a lot of interest out there even as we may have a temporary reimbursement code. Robert Bradway : And generally, Carter, as we've built what we think is industry-leading biosimilar franchise. It's a franchise that is performing very well, and we think it's earning attractive returns for our shareholders. Justin Claeys : All right. Let's go to the next question, please. Operator : Thank you, Carter. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Christopher Schott : Great. Thanks so much. Just a quick question on TEZSPIRE in COPD. Obviously, some really nice Phase II data earlier this year, but just was interested of how you think about the potential landscape here as we consider both DUPIXENT potentially the IL-33 is coming to market ahead of you. It seems like you might have a broader program and some interesting data. But just help me a little bit about how you're just commercially seeing that fitting into the landscape? Thank you. Peter Griffith : Well, Chris, why don't I start and this is Jay and Murdo hand off to you. So TEZSPIRE, as all here knows our TSLP monoclonal antibody that we're developing with AstraZeneca. And recently, we had a chance to read out a very compelling Phase II study in moderate to very severe COPD. This is a 337 patient study. They have -- these patients were having exacerbations despite triple therapy. And we went head-to-head against placebo over a 52-week period of time. The population actually broader even than DUPI and Murdo perhaps invite you to reflect on that. The data were quite positive with a numerically reduced exacerbation rate by 17%. We learned a lot from biomarker studies of blood eosinophils as to which subsets of patients, all pre-planned stand to benefit the most. And with these learnings, we're now pleased to announce that we're planning to initiate Phase III studies together with AstraZeneca. This trial is well structured and set up to definitively answer the question around efficacy TEZSPIRE in COPD. And Murdo, would you like to reflect a little bit about our competitive posture? Murdo Gordon : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Chris. We're obviously really pleased with the performance of TEZSPIRE so far in uncontrolled -- severe uncontrolled asthma. We're actually now the second most prescribed product when it comes to new-to-brand prescriptions in that category. So I think it's clear now that allergists and pulmonologists appreciate the differentiated profile and the unique mechanism of action that is TEZSPIRE. And we also believe, as Jay has highlighted that, that ability to address a broader population of patients because of the unique mechanism of action and the upstream way in which it intervenes in the immuno inflammation cascade. We're hopeful that, that differentiation and will continue to play out in COPD and we feel really good about the opportunity to compete there. With the combined resources of our partners at AstraZeneca and Amgen, we have a very strong share of voice currently in severe uncontrolled asthma, and we expect to be able to affect that same strong share of voice on the successful completion of the Phase III trial. Justin Claeys : Julianne, let's take the next question, please. Operator : Thank you, Chris. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Evan Seigerman : Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I want to touch on the biosimilar launch for the [indiscernible] biosimilar. Maybe talk about some of the launch strategy and more specifically, how you can stimulate demand among Ophtalmologists who would otherwise use a branded product. Are you able to offer rebates or extended invoicing for these practices? Thank you so much. Murdo Gordon : Thanks for the question. Obviously, I'm not going to talk about what we're doing commercially with respect to contracting. I will just say that we have a very broad deployed field force covering the key customers in this therapeutic area. We have very strong institutional organization that covers the purchasing groups and the large networks that treat a large percentage of the populations here. And the receptivity has been high. This isn't our first biosimilar launch, and we've been preparing effectively, and we're excited to be in the market. Justin Claeys : Julianne, next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Evan. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mohit Bansal : Great. Thank you very much for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Maybe a question for Jay. So given that you have diabetes patients with obesity in the ongoing Phase II trial, do you think you would be able to look into the A1C profile of the drug as well? Or is it just too small a trial to make any conclusion about that at this point? Murdo Gordon : Yeah. Thank you, Mohit. As you know, type 2 diabetes runs regrettably with obesity and with overweight. And so we do hope and expect to have some insights into diabetic -- anti-diabetic activity from the Phase II study, but we need to have an experience in a dedicated Phase II study of diabetes, in particular, in patients without obesity. So more to follow there towards later this year. Justin Claeys : Next question, please, Julliane. Operator : Thank you. Mohit. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Yaron Werber : Great. Murdo, I got maybe a couple of questions for you. One, just on Enbrel, this quarter was that we didn't see the normal Q3 bounce back. It's just this a new normal now? Or is there any particular one-timers in the quarter? And then secondly, you mentioned 12,000 accounts or 13,000 accounts ordering Prolia. I presume you're mentioning that on purpose is relating to the upcoming biosimilar launches late May next year. Can you talk about maybe just that dynamic in Prolia versus XGEVA, what to expect next year? Thank you. Murdo Gordon : Thanks for the question, Yaron. Yes, as you picked up, Enbrel was impacted by 2 negative trends in the quarter. One, of course, the regular decline in net price and then another one, which was a 30% adjustment in the quarter. So the quarter is a little softer than you normally see. Volume was up 4% in the quarter. So Enbrel continues to do quite well in terms of prescribers treating patients but we are expecting continued net price declines going forward. When we look at Prolia, I mentioned that we have 13,000 provider accounts having treated patients with Prolia so far this year. This is just to give an idea of the breadth and utility of this important product. The other thing that we enjoy with Prolia is it's an important way for us to source potential patients for EVENITY, which we continue to see very strong growth in. So our presence in the bone community and the treating physician population that treat the many women who are trying to reduce their risk of fracture despite the effect of their osteoporosis, we feel really good about it. And yes, it could end up becoming something that helps us in terms of market presence in the face of biosimilar competition in the future. Justin Claeys : All right. Julianne, let's take the next question, please. Operator : Thank you, Yaron. Our next question comes from Gregory Renza from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Gregory Renza : Great. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Bob, maybe just looking at the rare disease franchise. And we've always mentioned -- you've mentioned it's certainly a different approach in this space. And to that, what is Amgen's approach on pipeline replenishment when it comes to the rare disease pillar? Certainly, being fipaxalparant discontinuation in IPF. Just curious how to think about specific disease areas in rare disease and also how you think about kind of supporting and following your current marketed products in the rare disease franchise. Thanks so much. Robert Bradway : Yeah. We take this in a couple of pieces. And we're obviously very excited about rare disease and what we think we can bring to the field. With respect to the molecules that are already on the market, each of them, as you know, is in an early stage of this life cycle and involves either diseases or molecular attributes that we think we can add a lot of value to over time. So we're excited about what we think we can do with those domestically and in international markets. And we're also excited about, frankly, how our genetics resource, which you're familiar with has enabled us to glean insights both from existing molecules in the rare disease portfolio as well as potentially others that we might be able to add to it. But I'd invite Jay to share his thoughts. He's already brought a lot of energy to this topic with our rare disease organization. So Jay, fire away. James Bradner : Thanks, Bob, and thanks for Gregory for the question. The acquisition of Horizon has really activated and energized our staff in R&D. I think inspired by the mechanistic repositioning of a TEPEZZA for thyroid eye disease, the capacity to bring rare disease medicines expertly to patients around the world has really activated the imagination of our R&D colleagues, and we've had multiple new project launches since the acquisition of Horizon. Second, I would say that the integration has gone very smoothly. And the staff who've joined us through the Horizon acquisition have both seamlessly executed the development priorities for the rare disease portfolio and also have brought a lot of really interesting ideas. We have now a rare disease initiative with dedicated leadership. We have dedicated leadership in rare disease drug development. And we hope and expect to continue just the best-in-class external innovation that Horizon was really known for in this space. So a blend of internal and external innovation will, I think, more than replenish the rare disease mid- and early-stage pipeline in the years to come. Robert Bradway : We're also very excited about the talent that joined us from Horizon, particularly on the research and the medical side. So we feel really well equipped now to continue to invest in this area and make a difference for patients. Justin Claeys : Great. So, Julianne, as we're getting to the half hour here, maybe we'll take two more questions. Operator : Certainly. Thank you, Gregory. Our next question comes from Matt Phipps from William Blair. Please go ahead. Matthew Phipps : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to confirm if the 420 mg dose is that's going to be taken COPD trials. And is that something that you can formulate into a single injection given it's twice, I believe the current size? And then just to confirm, this is two separate Phase III trial? Will they be identical in design? Thank you. James Bradner : Yeah, Matt. Thanks for the question. They're good questions, but none that we can address here today. Together with our colleagues from AstraZeneca, we'll have a chance to describe in full the design of the Phase III program that will support the consideration of TEZSPIRE and COPD soon to come. Justin Claeys : All right. Julianne, I think we have time for one more. Operator : Our last question today will come from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Christopher Raymond : Thanks for squeezing me in. Just back on PAVBLU. We've gotten some interesting doc feedback on this with a decent amount of receptivity to this option. And one thing that's kind of a new development, I think, at least in the U.S. market has been a recent supply disruption to Avastin which may actually provide maybe more of an opening for this launch. Maybe just curious, as you looked at the market, talk about how you looked at the role of biosimilars in this predominantly buy and bill market with a very inexpensive option on Avastin, but one that seems to be fading at least in terms of suppliers wanting to provide the drug I guess, bottom line, does this Avastin supply issue make this even more interesting to you guys? Thanks. Murdo Gordon : Thanks for the question, Chris. But first and foremost, obviously, when you're treating serious illness, you want to have -- as a provider, you want to have a reliable supply of the product that you and your staff get used to handling. And I can say we are very fortunate to have world-class manufacturing here at Amgen, and we continue to have a highly reliable supply chain and manufacturing capability. We have benefited from shortages with other biosimilars including Avastin. As I'll remind you, we have MVASI, our own biosimilar to that product. So we are seeing customers coming to us given some shortages here in the U.S. and around the world. And again, I'm thankful for our manufacturing colleagues here at Amgen who are putting us in a very strong position to be able to speak to institutional customers to individual providers and obviously communicate with patients about the ability for us to supply and the reliability of that over time. That being said, I think we're definitely looking at our own opportunity here in the market with PAVBLU. I think you mentioned that there's high interest in the customers that you've talked to. These retina specialists are sophisticated customers. They understand that if they're going to go with a manufacturer, they're going to want a relationship that is persistent over time, and we believe we're well positioned for that. We have a great device in a prefilled syringe. We also have vials. So we're able to supply this demand in this market. And that's what we intend to do, and that's what our teams are in the field establishing right now. But thanks for your interest. Justin Claeys : Okay, Julianne. Thanks for moderating our call, and thank you all for joining us. If there were any of you who didn\u2019t get a chance to ask your questions, Justin and his team will be around still for a few more hours. So we look forward to gathering with you when we next have relevant information. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes our 2024 Q3 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : My name is Julienne, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Justin Claeys, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Claeys, you may now begin. Justin Claeys : Thank you, Julienne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Murdo Gordon, Jay Bradner and Peter Griffith. Through the course of our discussion today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and have provided appropriate reconciliations within the materials that accompany this call. We will also make some forward-looking statements, which are qualified by our safe harbor statement, and please note that actual results can vary materially. Over to you, Bob. Robert Bradway : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2024 capped another year of strong execution at Amgen. Our operations teams supplied every patient every time. Our clinical teams reliably delivered quality results across the portfolio, and our commercial teams grew the business across our 4 therapeutic areas and in each of our geographic regions. The operating rhythm that we've established in our business will serve us well for 2025 and the longer term. Looking ahead, our objective is to deliver long-term growth while navigating regulatory and political change, declining net prices and losses of exclusivity. We have a track record of doing just that. If you consider the past decade, we grew revenues above a mid-single-digit percent level and EPS at approximately 9% per year over the period despite facing biosimilar and generic competition across products that accounted for about 50% of our revenues. As we look to the next decade, our novel medicines are well positioned to address patient demographics in a rapidly aging world, and we expect that our operating discipline to enable us to scale to meet the needs of patients while continuing to deliver for our shareholders. Reflecting on our marketed products in 2024, we exited the fourth quarter with 14 medicines each annualizing at over $1 billion. And notably, several of these will be key drivers of growth through the decade. Let me highlight a few. Starting in general medicine. Repatha and EVENITY continued to deliver attractive growth. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death globally. And Repatha, now a multibillion-dollar product, continues to expand as access improves worldwide. We are the leader worldwide in bone health, addressing the huge need for fracture prevention in those living with osteoporosis. The clinical performance of EVENITY since its launch demonstrates the leading role it can play in reducing fracture risk for millions of postmenopausal women. In rare diseases, 2025 will be an exciting year. We look forward to regulatory approvals for TEPEZZA internationally and launches in new indications for UPLIZNA, further strengthening the growth trajectory of our rare disease business. In inflammation, we continue to be inspired by the strong performance of TEZSPIRE and the progress we're making advancing into new indications, including COPD, which is the third leading cause of death, where we intend to initiate Phase III studies; and of course, in chronic rhinosinusitis, which runs in parallel with other respiratory diseases. In oncology, our leading bispecific T-cell engager platform provides further opportunities for growth with BLINCYTO moving into frontline treatment and demonstrating compelling survival benefit in B-ALL. IMDELLTRA showing impressive efficacy in hard-to-treat small cell lung cancer and xaluritamig advancing into Phase III in advanced prostate cancer. 2025 promises to be another milestone year for our rapidly advancing pipeline with important Phase III data readouts for programs including across our general medicine, rare disease, inflammation and oncology portfolios. Beyond these readouts, we'll be initiating several new Phase III trials of MariTide in obesity and related conditions. This is an exciting time for innovation in our laboratories, in our factories with the science and manufacturing and in leveraging technology across the company. When it comes to artificial intelligence, we're finding new opportunities across our business, and AI is helping us deliver innovative medicines to more patients even faster. To wrap up, 2024 demonstrated the strength of our business, the depth and breadth of our portfolio and the power of our pipeline. As we step into 2025, we're poised to deliver continued growth and innovation in the near term, through 2030 and beyond. And I want to thank our global team for their exceptional contributions and dedication to our mission. With that, I'll turn it over to Murdo for an update on our commercial organization. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Bob. In the fourth quarter, product sales grew 11% year-over-year, capping off a year of growth fueled by strong execution across the business. For the full year, product sales grew 19% and 10 products grew by double digits or better, creating strong momentum for growth in 2025 and beyond. Two products on a strong growth trajectory are Repatha and EVENITY, which together grew 35% year-over-year driven by 39% volume growth and accounting for nearly $1 billion in sales growth in the year. Both of these important brands serve large patient populations that are mostly untreated despite the availability of highly impactful therapies, indicating robust growth potential. Repatha sales increased 36% in 2024, reaching over $2.2 billion in sales. There are 100 million patients globally in need of effective treatment for lowering their LDL-C. And we see strong potential for growth of Repatha around the world as physicians, patients and payers recognize the importance of therapies like Repatha for patients at risk of major cardiovascular events. In the United States, Repatha sales grew 44% in 2024 with volume growth of 54%. The majority of patients with elevated LDL-C are in the primary care setting. And in 2024, our increased investment focused on primary care physicians improved the number of Repatha prescribers by 50% supporting future growth strategy. Our direct-to-patient education efforts doubled the number of patients who asked their doctor for Repatha. Volume growth was further supported by Repatha's broad access and reimbursement, and we see more payers seeking to ease or even remove prior authorization barriers, making Repatha more accessible and affordable for patients. Cardiologists and primary care physicians reported in a recent survey that Repatha access has improved significantly versus 2 years ago. Outside the U.S., Repatha continues to grow across major markets despite increased competition in the segment. Over the past several years, the price of Repatha has been impacted by an expansion of coverage in the U.S. and the growth of new markets around the world. Moving forward, we expect less price erosion for Repatha with 2025 net price expected to decline by mid-single digits or less. EVENITY sales increased 35% in 2024, reaching almost $1.6 billion in sales. EVENITY is the only therapeutic that both builds bone and slows resorption, which can play a critical role in reducing fracture risk for millions of women who are postmenopausal. Despite the significant need, only 210,000 patients in the U.S. have been treated with EVENITY to date, while millions remain at risk. With over 90% of very high-risk patients not currently receiving appropriate treatment, we see a significant opportunity to grow EVENITY in 2025 and beyond. In the U.S., EVENITY continues to be the segment leader in the bone-builder market. We drove a 14% quarter-over-quarter increase in new customers ordering EVENITY and saw an increase in prescription volume from both established and new EVENITY prescribers. We've increased our investment in EVENITY and have fully shifted the focus of our U.S. bone field force towards EVENITY. I'll move to our rare disease portfolio, which delivered over $4.5 billion in sales in 2024. TEPEZZA, our largest product in the rare disease portfolio, generated sales of $1.9 billion in the year, representing 5% year-on-year growth. Since launch, TEPEZZA has had a positive impact for thousands of patients living with thyroid eye disease. There are roughly 100,000 patients suffering from thyroid eye disease in the U.S. who could benefit from TEPEZZA and to reach them, we've intensified our efforts to engage a broad prescriber base of oculoplastic surgeons, ophthalmologists and endocrinologists. We're moving quickly in international markets to secure regulatory approval for TEPEZZA, which will drive additional growth. And we've successfully launched TEPEZZA in Japan, where it's the first and only medicine approved to treat active thyroid eye disease. In 2025, we expect to launch TEPEZZA in 7 additional countries. In inflammation, TEZSPIRE continues its strong trajectory of nearly $1 billion in sales in the year, a 71% year-over-year increase. We've driven increased adoption by pulmonologists supported by TEZSPIRE's unique profile to treat patients with multiple severe uncontrolled asthma triggers and drivers. TEZSPIRE has strong future growth potential given the need to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe uncontrolled asthma. Our innovative oncology portfolio, including BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate, XGEVA and IMDELLTRA contributed almost $8 billion in sales for the full year. Year-over-year sales grew 11% driven by volume growth and higher net selling price. Our leading bispecific T-cell engager platform, which developed BLINCYTO and IMDELLTRA, continues to address critical unmet needs in oncology while providing significant opportunities for future growth. BLINCYTO sales grew 41% for the full year, reaching over $1.2 billion in sales. We expect continued strong growth in 2025 driven by broad prescribing across academic and community segments. Physician prescribing is growing, and compelling new clinical data is redefining BLINCYTO as the standard of care for both adult and pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell ALL. Our U.S. launch of IMDELLTRA for the treatment of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer who are progressing on or after chemotherapy is off to a strong start, generating $115 million in sales in 7 months since launch. We see increasing breadth of adoption in both academic and community settings driven by strong clinical conviction for IMDELLTRA's transformational efficacy. IMDELLTRA has treated approximately 2,000 patients since launch. Each year, an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 patients progress to second-line treatment for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Our medical and commercial teams are operating with urgency to bring IMDELLTRA to more patients living with this aggressive disease. Sales of our biosimilar products were $2.2 billion in 2024, an increase of 16% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, our team readily executed the launch of PAVBLU, a biosimilar to EYLEA, with 9 weeks of sales totaling $31 million. Response from retina specialists to PAVBLU has been very positive with strong intent to purchase and administer this high-quality Amgen biosimilar delivered in an easy-to-use prefilled syringe. The next wave of biosimilar launches continues in 2025. In January, building on the strong introduction of PAVBLU at the end of 2024, we launched WEZLANA, a biosimilar to STELARA. And in the second quarter, we expect to launch BEKEMV, a biosimilar to SOLIRIS. With this next wave of launches, we anticipate robust growth and attractive returns from our biosimilar portfolio. 2024 was a strong year of execution across Amgen. We view execution as a team effort that tightly coordinated integration between research and development, manufacturing operations and our commercial teams enables us to serve record numbers of patients across the portfolio and around the world. This relentless cross-enterprise focus will accelerate our ability to reach even more patients with Amgen medicines in 2025. And with that, I'll hand it over to Jay. James Bradner : Thank you, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. At this time last year, we planned a very ambitious R&D agenda, and I'm very proud to say we delivered, meeting or exceeding almost all enrollment targets and generating impact and value across the portfolio. Specifically, in 2024, we received 2 important U.S. regulatory approvals in oncology, completed 5 positive Phase III studies and initiated 3 new Phase III trials while advancing the broad MariTide program. Let's begin with MariTide, a therapy with a unique, differentiated and highly competitive profile. Since our Phase II data disclosure last November, we have engaged extensively with key opinion leaders and have received strong enthusiasm and support. This excitement stems from MariTide's ability to deliver consistent, predictable and sustained weight loss through 52 weeks without hitting a weight loss plateau and convenient monthly or less frequent dosing, a clear advantage over current weekly therapies. Additionally, key opinion leaders conveyed their excitement for robust and clinically meaningful improvements in cardiometabolic parameters, including hemoglobin A1C, demonstrated by MariTide treatment. With a further optimized simple dose-escalation schedule and significantly fewer injections per year, we expect to improve persistent and long-term health outcomes. MariTide represents a promising treatment advance for people living with obesity and related conditions, and we are committed to fully realizing its potential. In the first half of 2025, we expect to initiate the first studies in our broad Phase III MARITIME program and expect to present the full MariTide Phase II data set at a major medical congress. In the second half of 2025, we expect key data readouts from both the ongoing Phase II type 2 diabetes study and part 2 of the ongoing Phase II chronic weight management study. Beyond MariTide, in general medicine, we look forward to data from the Repatha VESALIUS Phase III primary prevention study in the second half of this year. Having demonstrated profound and sustained benefit of Repatha in the secondary prevention setting, we're excited about these data and the opportunity to reach additional patients at high risk of a first cardiovascular event. Turning to olpasiran, our promising best-in-class, small interfering RNA medicine targeting Lp(a), we are bringing a precision medicine to cardiovascular risk reduction for the many individuals with Lp(a) elevation. The fully enrolled OCEAN(a) Phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial of olpasiran continues to progress, and we expect to initiate an additional Phase III outcome study in patients with elevated Lp(a) and at high risk for a first cardiovascular event late this year or in the first half of 2026. Shifting to rare disease. We are very excited about UPLIZNA's potential to serve even more patients facing rare inflammatory illnesses. In 2024, we generated compelling data from the UPLIZNA Phase III MITIGATE study in patients with IgG4-related disease, a serious inflammatory condition with no approved therapies. These data are now under FDA priority review with a PDUFA date of April 3, 2025. The FDA also granted orphan drug designation to UPLIZNA for the treatment of generalized Myasthenia Gravis based upon 26-week data from the Phase III MINT study. This study showed UPLIZNA to be highly effective on multiple clinical outcomes, also reducing the need for steroids with patient-centered convenient dosing. We eagerly anticipate the 52-week data later this year, which will provide further insight into response and long-term durability. With 2 anticipated approvals on the horizon in IgG4-related disease and generalized Myasthenia Gravis, we are more confident than ever about UPLIZNA's expanding impact on the management of rare inflammatory diseases. In inflammation, we remain on track to initiate Phase III studies of TEZSPIRE in COPD, targeting patients with moderate to very severe COPD with bloody eosinophil counts greater than or equal to 150 cells per microliter. COPD is the world's third leading cause of death, and we're excited about the impact TEZSPIRE could have in this setting. Beyond COPD, regulatory submissions are underway in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, supported by positive Phase III data. And we continue advancing a Phase III study in eosinophilic esophagitis. The rocatinlimab Phase III ROCKET program in atopic dermatitis is progressing with additional data expected throughout 2025. These studies will provide deeper insight into rocatinlimab's profile. Beyond atopic dermatitis, we continue to explore rocatinlimab in moderate-to-severe asthma and in prurigo nodularis, a chronic skin condition characterized by extreme itchiness. As previously indicated, we are pursuing B-cell depletion in autoimmune disease with both blinatumomab and inebilizumab. Our initial focus is on systemic lupus erythematosus with plans to expand into additional indications. 2025 will be an important year in oncology, where we expect 3 key Phase III data readouts. I will start with our rapidly advancing BiTE portfolio. Last December, very exciting BLINCYTO data were shared at ASH and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine. In a Phase III study conducted by the Children's Oncology Group, BLINCYTO added to chemotherapy improved 3-year disease-free survival to 96% compared to 88% with chemotherapy alone in the upfront treatment of pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We are also advancing a subcutaneous formulation of blinatumomab with a potentially registration-enabling study in adults and adolescents with relapsed/refractory B-ALL expected to begin in the second half of 2025. Based on our experience to date, subcutaneous blinatumomab has the potential to improve the patient experience, efficacy and tolerability. Our second approved BiTE therapy, IMDELLTRA, a first-in-class bispecific T-cell engager targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer, is rapidly advancing into earlier lines of therapy. Phase III studies are ongoing in both extensive-stage and limited-stage disease. Data from DeLLphi-304 are expected in the first half of 2025. This study compares IMDELLTRA with standard-of-care chemotherapy in second-line extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Our first-in-class STEAP1 CD3 bispecific T-cell engager, xaluritamig, has entered Phase III clinical development with a study in post-taxane, metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. We are also exploring xaluritamig in combination therapy and in earlier lines of prostate cancer with multiple Phase Ib studies ongoing. We remain excited about the growth potential of our BiTE platform and the opportunity to reach additional cancer patients with BLINCYTO, IMDELLTRA and xaluritamig. Beyond our T-cell engagers, bemarituzumab, our first-in-class fibroblast growth factor receptor IIb-directed monoclonal antibody, is advancing to frontline gastric cancer therapy. We expect data in the first half of 2025 from FORTITUDE-101, a Phase III study of bemarituzumab combined with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. In the second half of 2025, we expect data from an analysis of FORTITUDE-102, a Phase III study of bemarituzumab combined with chemotherapy and nivolumab. On biosimilars, we are rapidly advancing 3 Phase III programs evaluating our biosimilars to OPDIVO, KEYTRUDA and OCREVUS, the next wave of Amgen biosimilar products. In closing, I want to thank my Amgen colleagues for their unwavering commitment to patients facing grievous illnesses and for their focus and collaboration throughout a highly productive 2024. We look forward to an exciting year ahead and continued pipeline momentum. I'll now turn it over to Peter. Peter Griffith : Thank you, Jay. We're pleased with our execution excellence in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2024, and we remain on track with our long-term objectives. The financial results are shown on Slides 28 to 30 of the slide deck. Full year total revenues of $33.4 billion grew 19% year-over-year driven by 21 products with record sales. Product sales increased 19% year-over-year driven by 23% volume growth. Excluding products acquired from Horizon, product sales for the full year increased 7% year-over-year driven by 11% volume growth. For the full year, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 47%. We continue to invest in advancing our pipeline with non-GAAP R&D spend increasing 25% year-over-year for the full year to a record $5.9 billion due to investments in the late-stage pipeline, including MariTide, rocatinlimab, bemarituzumab and IMDELLTRA as well as Horizon-acquired programs. Excluding Horizon, non-GAAP R&D spending increased 15% year-over-year. The Horizon integration is progressing well, and we expect to reach the previously announced $500 million in pretax cost synergies by year 3 post acquisition. The acquisition was accretive to non-GAAP EPS for the full year 2024. Full year non-GAAP other income and expense was up $1.1 billion year-over-year, almost entirely due to increased interest expense from the Horizon acquisition. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet with $4.5 billion of debt retired in 2024. Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased 2 percentage points year-over-year to 14.5% for the full year primarily due to the change in earnings mix, including the addition of the Horizon business and net favorable items. The company generated $10.4 billion in free cash flow for the full year and $4.4 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter. These results reflect strong momentum in the business and favorable timing of collections at year-end. We executed capital expenditures in 2024 of $1.3 billion, in line with the guidance provided, with the cash outflow being $1.1 billion and the remainder to be paid in 2025. Our commitment to innovation is also evident as we deploy artificial intelligence across the value chain, including informing molecule design and discovery research, enabling faster trial enrollment and streamlining regulatory filings in clinical development, and enhancing our responsiveness to customers in commercial operations. In addition, we returned capital to shareholders as we paid competitive dividend of $2.25 per share in the fourth quarter. This represented a 6% increase compared to 2023. We expect that we will continue to increase our dividend. Let's turn to the outlook for the business for 2025 on Slide 31. We expect our 2025 total revenues in the range of $34.3 billion to $35.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share between $20 and $21.20. Our revenue range reflects our strong growth outlook driven by numerous opportunities across each of our therapeutic areas. We expect continued growth across a number of products, led by our near-term growth drivers, Repatha, EVENITY, TEZSPIRE; our innovative oncology portfolio; our rare disease portfolio; and biosimilars. This growth will more than offset declines due to the upcoming denosumab patent expiration as well as continued price declines across our portfolio in 2025. For total company revenues, we expect each quarter of 2025 to have a relatively similar year-over-year growth rate. A reminder as you model the first quarter of 2025 and consistent with our historical trends, we expect Otezla and Enbrel to follow their typical pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters. Also note that biosimilar sales in the U.S. can significantly vary quarter-to-quarter, depending on customer ordering patterns. For example, we expect Q1 AMGEVITA sales in the U.S. to be in line with Q3 2024. For the full year, we expect other revenue to be approximately $1.4 billion. In 2025, we are driving R&D investments to support our promising late-stage pipeline, including MariTide and olpasiran. As a result, we project the full year non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 46%. We project non-GAAP cost of sales to be in the range of 18% to 19% as a percentage of product sales for 2025. This projection reflects the ongoing impact of sales mix, including profit share and royalties. We expect non-GAAP R&D expense to grow year-over-year in the mid-teens in 2025 with investments increasing to advance key pipeline assets, including MariTide and olpasiran. We see significant potential in our innovative pipeline, and it is important that we strategically invest now to fully unlock these opportunities. And for the non-GAAP SG&A spend, we expect the 2025 full year amount as a percentage of product sales to decline by approximately 1 to 2 percentage points year-over-year as we continue to drive efficiencies and prioritize resources, including leveraging both automation and our newly established innovation and technology hub in India. Overall, the operating margin of roughly 46% indicates our commitment to investing in the best innovation while also driving execution excellence, efficiency and prioritization across the organization. Consistent with prior years and in line with typical lower product sales in Q1, we expect Q1 non-GAAP operating margin to be the lowest of the year at roughly 42% and then accelerate in each of the quarters following the first quarter. We anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2025. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 15% to 16%. Similar to 2024, we expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2025, and we expect the share count in the first quarter of 2025 to be flat to the fourth quarter of 2024. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 billion in 2025. This is consistent with our capital allocation priority to invest in our business and scale capacity for growth in marketed products and the pipeline. We expect to maintain strong investment-grade credit ratings as we continue to generate strong free cash flow, strengthen our balance sheet and remain on track to return to our pre-Horizon capital structure by the end of 2025. In 2025, we expect free cash flow performance to be similar to 2023. This decline is primarily driven by 2024 working capital favorability and incremental capital expenditures. Free cash flow in the first half of 2025 will be impacted by strong 2024 year-end collections timing, the shift in 2024 tax payments to the second quarter of 2025 and also the final $1.8 billion repatriation tax payment in the second quarter of 2025. Our long-term outlook remains strong, and I'm grateful to our colleagues worldwide for their dedication to serving patients. This concludes our financial update. I'll now hand it back to Bob for our Q&A session. Robert Bradway : Okay. Just to recap before we go to the Q&A session, as you can see, our results highlight the breadth and depth of opportunities across our business. And we exited the fourth quarter with 10 products growing at double-digit sales rate and 14 products annualizing at over $1 billion. And for the year, to repeat, we had 21 products delivering record sales. So this momentum supports our outlook for 2025 and through the long term. And with that, we'd be happy to take questions. Justin Claeys : Julienne, if you could please remind our participants of the procedures here. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. Yaron Werber : Maybe just a couple of things. On 514, the one that's on clinical hold for obesity, can you comment, was that an incretin or non-incretin mechanism? And then secondly, maybe just for Murdo. A few things looked really strong. AMGEVITA was extremely strong at 294. Is that sustainable from now on? What drove that? Robert Bradway : All right. We'll take it in 2 parts. Jay, do you want to address the 513, I think it is. James Bradner : Thanks, Yaron. AMG 513 is a novel investigational medicine for patients with obesity. It's currently in Phase I investigation. We have not disclosed the mechanism of action. This remains a competitive space, as you know. Murdo Gordon : And Yaron, this is Murdo here. We're pleased with overall biosimilars performance. And our biosimilar portfolio, as I mentioned, last year grew about 16%, and we're confident we can continue to grow that portfolio going forward. One of which -- of those growth contributors will be AMGEVITA. Justin Claeys : Great. Julienne, we'll go to the next question. I will remind folks we have quite a full queue today. So if you can limit yourself to one question, that would be great. Operator : Our next question comes from Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Courtney Breen : I wanted to ask a little bit about Repatha. Obviously, we've seen kind of strong growth there and there's new indications coming, particularly in the primary prevention space. Can you just talk a little bit about kind of how you anticipate this market evolving as we think about the oral PCSK9s and Merck's CORALreef lipids trial that is also scheduled to read out later this year? There seem to be suggestions that that could perform as well as an injectable in terms of the efficacy. So just wanting to understand how you would position. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks, Courtney. We're obviously very pleased with the performance of Repatha in 2024, putting up some very strong growth both in volume and in revenues, both in the U.S. and outside of the United States. And we expect to see that continue. We expect to be able to treat the many patients who have not had their LDL cholesterol optimized, and there's millions upon millions of these patients. We are barely scratching the surface when it comes to treating them. And we think that Repatha offers a really ideal solution for patients to receive it and for prescribers to prescribe it. What we're really pleased about is the perception amongst prescribers now that Repatha is an easy-to-access medicine and an affordable medicine, and that's thanks to the efforts of our access teams around the world making sure that Repatha is appropriately reimbursed and positioned on formularies with PBMs. And we've been successful in removing those barriers. So we really are at an inflection point in Repatha's performance and feel very, very good about the trajectory and momentum we established in 2024. With respect to new competition, obviously, there's more than just LDL cholesterol-lowering evidence that needs to be introduced here. Repatha has clearly demonstrated benefit in secondary prevention of heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular sequel. And the goal, of course, as you mentioned, is that with VESALIUS, which reads out later this year, that we'll be able to show that you can actually lower the risk of a first heart attack or stroke or other cardiovascular event. So we're kind of -- we're in the mode of helping treat hard endpoints now in this market and not just lowering LDL. So we'll see what the evidence is and how it accumulates with not just the orals, but other competitors that are trying to come into this market. But again, obviously, Repatha is a very important growth driver for us now and into the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter : In the context of your 2025 sales guidance, can you speak to where you feel The Street is underappreciating growth and discuss how you factored in the Part D redesign to your projections? Robert Bradway : Let me take it in two pieces. Murdo, why don't you first start on the Part D redesign and then, Pete, why don't you jump in here? Peter Griffith : Sure. Murdo Gordon : Yes. The Part D redesign at a total portfolio level for us is relatively neutral between some [Technical Difficulty] chronic care cardiovascular products at an affordable price like Repatha tend to do well when patients' out of pocket is capped and smooth. And that's what we believe will happen for products like Repatha going forward. Peter? Peter Griffith : Great. Murdo, thank you. Salveen, thank you for the question. I would just remind you what we've said, which is let's start from 10 products with double-digit growth in 2024 over 2023, 14 products annualizing or at blockbuster status of $1 billion or more and 21 that were records in 2024, so strong end-market portfolio, Salveen. So when we look at 2025, I'd really like to start with 2 and then add 4 more on to think about, Murdo talked about Repatha. So as he said, 100 million people around the world needing treatment, Visalia is coming later this year and less price erosion, maybe mid-single digit or less this year on that. He talked about the strong access globally. So we expect Repatha to continue to be a strong medicine going forward. And the second on EVENITY, it's got low single-digit penetration. Greater than 90% of the high-risk patients in the U.S. haven't been treated. And there's a significant unmet need there with EVENITY. So we think those 2 are very, very important. But let me also share TEZSPIRE, up 71% in 2024 to almost $1 billion. I think it was $972 million of product sales. Innovative oncology, up 11%, the 7 innovative oncology products we have in 2024. We think that's a very strong portfolio to help patients with oncology and hematology disease. Rare disease, up to about $4.5 billion in 2024. And reminder, these are early life cycle products, and so they've got a ways to go. And when we think about those 4, we see a lot of growth there and a lot of opportunities. But then we get to biosimilars. We shared with you a 16% growth up to about $2.2 billion in 2024. We've got some launches coming this year. And so we continue to see a lot of growth in that. So we think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to grow this business in a strong way in 2025 and going forward. And as I shared in my -- expiry on denosumab. So I'll leave it there, but we're very pleased with the business. And most importantly, we expect more medicine to more patients in 2025 around the world. Operator : Our next question comes from David Amsellem from Piper Sandler. David Amsellem : So wanted to switch gears and get your thoughts on some of the Horizon products. KRYSTEXXA, how are you thinking about the growth runway there and the potential for biosimilar down the road? And then also how you're thinking about the competitive landscape for TEPEZZA? Robert Bradway : Sure. Murdo, do you want to... Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thank you, David. KRYSTEXXA, KRYSTEXXA had a very strong year in growth year-over-year. When we look at the performance from the prior period, KRYSTEXXA was up 23%; UPLIZNA up 40%; TAVNEOS up 111%; and TEPEZZA up 5%. So this is -- as Peter mentioned, overall, it's a portfolio of products very early on in their life cycle with more data to flow as is the case, of course, with UPLIZNA with our IgG4 data and additional GMG data coming on 52 weeks. So we have a number of catalysts that will grow our business in the U.S., and then we have catalysts for growth outside the U.S. with, of course, international launches and expansion, which is well underway with the recent approval of TEPEZZA in Japan. With respect to KRYSTEXXA overall, again, even though KRYSTEXXA is part of our rare disease portfolio, severe uncontrolled gout is not a rare disease. It's not a rare condition. There are lots of patients out there who suffer continuously. And with the immunomodulation data, we are now able to help many of those patients. And so we see continued robust opportunity for growth there. And we're also looking to develop additional pipeline assets. And so Jay and his team are looking at those opportunities. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Michael Yee : Other than MariTide, you've had 1 or 2 obesity assets have some slip-ups. Can you maybe comment about your strategic view about where you'd like to be in a couple of years, if you are so confident on MariTide, given that everyone's chasing a multiple asset portfolio, including orals, and you seem to be pretty early stage outside of MariTide. So maybe just comment about your appetite there and whether you can add to the portfolio? Robert Bradway : Sure. Mike, I'm not sure we'd accept the premise. But anyway, let's talk about the portfolio of obesity programs. Go ahead, Jay. James Bradner : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Akin to what Bob said, I wouldn't call these slip-ups at all. Early phase clinical investigation here at Amgen has a really high bar for what medicines go forward, and the next medicine up after MariTide did not meet that bar. Our obesity efforts fit very well with our strength in cardiovascular disease, nephrology, and more generally, the emerging presence in primary care. And so we're very confident that we have all the talent, capabilities, ideas and rising medicines to be a major player in obesity for the fullness of time, which we've studied for more than a decade. The research and early development pipeline has ideas targeting integrins, also non-integrins. We have medicines that will be given orally, others by subcutaneous administration. We're also interested to open partnerships through external innovation. And so we're very confident in MariTide and very confident in the pipeline behind it. Robert Bradway : Sorry, Jay, just to clarify one thing. The 513 is still -- we still expect to have that development. We don't believe the issue that we referenced is related to the drug, but we'll go through the usual steps with the regulators on that. But Jay was referring to another product that we're no longer advancing that was previously in the clinic, so -- when he said it didn't pass the hurdle. But again, we're excited about the program and the molecules that are coming forward to the clinic out of the obesity portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Jay Olson : Congrats [Technical Difficulty]... Robert Bradway : Jay, sorry, we can't hear you. Take another start. Jay Olson : Can you hear me better now? Robert Bradway : Yes. Go ahead. Jay Olson : Okay. Could you describe the key lessons you expect to learn from the Repatha VESALIUS-CV outcome study results, how you can leverage those lessons across your portfolio, including olpasiran and MariTide? And any synergies you plan to capture across these programs? Robert Bradway : Sure. Jay? James Bradner : Sure. Why don't I start and then Murdo, I invite you to speak to synergies and the like. We've learned a lot from Repatha already. We have a leading capability in population genetics and epidemiology. And now the broad use of Repatha in secondary prevention is a fantastic setup for VESALIUS-CV. As you know, this is a Phase III large cardiovascular outcome study of more than 12,000 patients, placebo-controlled, patients at high cardiovascular risk without prior MI or stroke. This is ongoing. We have an event-driven readout expected in the second half of this year. This will be a large and valuable data set for us to mine to understand the further improvement of cardiovascular outcomes for patients as it relates to LDL-C, but also for other parameters. We have already harvested so many insights from Repatha and carried that into the design and execution of the olpasiran Phase III program, which as you heard is -- it has an event-driven outcome, expected a readout in the second half of next year. So very valuable data set that will, no doubt, prompt significant further insights. Murdo Gordon : Thanks, Jay. The synergies here are significant and substantial given the leadership presence we have in LDL lowering and being able to apply that to Lp(a) lowering with olpasiran obviously is successful in the readout of our Phase III trial. I do think there's going to be some differences, though, given that Lp(a) cannot be modified by lifestyle, diet and exercise. There are no other generically available or branded available products that can lower Lp(a). We do think that the intentionality and the speed to move to a pharmacotherapeutic for Lp(a) lowering will be different than it has been for LDL. But nonetheless, we're clearly engaged with all of the different stakeholders in the lipid lowering and atherosclerotic market, and we're engaging them as appropriate to make sure that they understand the profile of olpasiran and the design of the trial that Jay mentioned and ultimately when we have results to share. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Hammond from Wolfe Research. Alex Hammond : So with more and more companies looking to China for innovation, what is Amgen's stance on looking overseas for clinical-stage assets? And I guess more broadly, what is your appetite for M&A now post the Horizon acquisition? Robert Bradway : We're -- our position on business development remains pretty consistent, Alex. We're focused on molecules that we think we can add value to, irrespective of where they come from. So we have had and maintained a very active search for interesting opportunities for licensing and acquisitions all around the globe. And yes, we're open for business, looking for those opportunities. Operator : Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence Flynn : Just wanted to say my thoughts are with all those Amgen employees and everyone in the L.A. area who's been impacted by the devastating wildfires. I had a 2-parter on MariTide. I know you're doing part 2 of the Phase II to explore quarterly dosing. Just wondering if there's an interim look there so you can incorporate that schedule into the Phase III program if you decide to? And then I was wondering if you can tell us if ADA is a fair assumption for presentation of the full MariTide Phase II obesity data? Robert Bradway : Sure. Jay? James Bradner : Yes. Thanks, Terence, for your question and really appreciate the call-out for the associates here and the area residents facing these fires. We have, as you know, an ongoing part 2 of our Phase II study in chronic weight management. That is a 52-week study, and we expect data readout late this year. I can confirm that we look forward to presenting the Phase II Part 1 data at the ADA meeting in June this year in Chicago and look forward to seeing you there. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Risinger from Leerink Partners. Dave Risinger : So I have sort of a simple question. Clearly, you've provided a lot of helpful pipeline updates on the call. So my question, Jay, is could you just explain why you're announcing today the plans to initiate a new olpasiran Phase III trial in high-risk patients when it's not going to be initiated until late '25 or early '26? What is pending initiating that trial? Robert Bradway : Again, Dave, maybe I can just clarify. I mentioned this in January at JPM in the context -- it's Bob speaking, Dave, in the context of what to expect for the year. But Jay, go ahead and address the specific piece of the question, if you like. James Bradner : Yes. No, nothing more to add. We have already announced our intention to initiate a Phase III clinical investigation of olpasiran in primary prevention. This is a strong hypothesis for protecting patients with elevations of Lp(a). We hope to initiate this study -- intend to initiate this study in the second half of this year or in the first half of next year. We just have a total commitment to the benefit of patients facing in this case, genetically defined risk of cardiovascular disease. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Just wanted to talk through TEPEZZA and just how we should be thinking about growth in both the U.S. and internationally here? I guess specifically, can you talk about ex U.S., the Japan opportunity and some of these new markets? And can we think about the rapid ramp that we saw in the U.S. kind of repeating itself in those markets? Or are these more gradual ramps as these roll out? Murdo Gordon : Yes. Chris, it's Murdo here. Thanks for the question on TEPEZZA. In Japan, the epidemiology is quite significant here, roughly 25,000 patients, what we're talking about. The care model in Japan does reduce the friction that prescribers and patients experience in terms of finding access to the right physician and then access to a site of care. So we do expect there to be a pretty good uptake in this market. Not sure about the bolus dynamic that we saw in the United States that did have some impact because it was a launch during the COVID period. So I'm not sure I would compare curves there. But I would expect steady penetration of the Japanese patient population. We know there have been over 550 patients already identified by prescribers. I was there for the launch at the end of last year. The weekly data are showing some pretty good steady momentum. And so Japan will be a very good source of growth for TEPEZZA internationally. As I mentioned, we've got 7 other markets that we'll be launching in, hopefully, this year, pending regulatory approvals. And we do see that international catalyst -- that international growth as a catalyst for the overall brand. And it's obviously one of the things that drove the acquisition, the ability for Amgen's global footprint to bring these medicines to more patients. In the U.S., we continue to focus on broadening the prescriber base for TEPEZZA. So helping general ophthalmology and endocrinology diagnose, not just the Gravis disease but also the thyroid eye disease and then find a site of care for patients to receive as a treatment. Just one overarching comment I'll make on TEPEZZA, it does follow the pattern we see in some other products in our portfolio where that first quarter this year will be a little bit lower than the other 3 quarters, mostly a function of people having their insurance reverified and/or purchasing patterns in the market. So just something to watch out for. But long term, TEPEZZA growth is looking very good given the international approvals and the momentum that we plan to generate in the U.S. Operator : Our next question comes from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. James Shin : Any color on the indication for the MARITIME trials that will start in the first half '25? And can you say anything on whether or not MARITIME will have head-to-head against incumbents such as tirzepatide or sema at this point? James Bradner : Yes. Thank you, James. The MARITIME Phase III program has a focus on chronic weight management, on cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, heart failure and possibly additional indications. As our discussions are at a rather mature state with the federal regulators, it would be premature to talk through any design principles around these trials at this time, but we look very much forward to initiating the MARITIME Phase III program. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Tim Anderson : I know Amgen commonly says it doesn't get enough credit by The Street for its biosimilar business, so I'd like to ask about that. And just one product in particular, PAVBLU, the EYLEA biosimilar, why can't that be a very significant product for you guys as the only seller into that large market, right, for the next few years? It seems like it could get to a $1 billion-plus-type sales level. And can you give us some idea of what's in your 2025 guide for this? Robert Bradway : Okay. Tim, we couldn't hear the -- very clearly at the beginning of your question, but it seems that you're asking about biosimilars. Perhaps you suggested we don't get enough credit for what we do in biosimilars. If that's what you said, we're grateful. We are a world leader, as you know, in biosimilars, and our focus has been to reliably supply biosimilars when we're appropriately able to enter the market. And our objective is to be amongst the first wave of biosimilar entrants, and that's what we've achieved with PAVBLU. But as to the specifics, Murdo, do you want to address Tim's question? Murdo Gordon : Yes. Tim, as you know, we don't give product-specific guidance. But given your comments, I would say we're very pleased with how the launch is going. We, as Bob mentioned, always try to target being in the first wave. We find ourselves being the only biosimilar available in the market right now. And of course, that represents an opportunity that we will capitalize on. The current feedback from retina specialists that we've been talking to is very enthusiastic, very positive. They are pleased that Amgen is bringing yet another high-quality biosimilar in a very easy-to-use prefilled syringe. Given the number of administrations these retina specialists do each and every day, that device is quite important. And thanks to our legal colleagues and our manufacturing operations and process development teams, they've done a very, very nice job of making sure that we have a path to helping many more patients with another Amgen biosimilar. Peter Griffith : Maybe to add on just a little bit, Murdo and Bob, I would suggest, Tim, we build what we think obviously is an industry-leading biosimilar franchise. We operate very efficiently. We leverage the broader Amgen footprint, including manufacturing and operations. We believe we're earning attractive returns for our shareholders in this. When we pursue an opportunity, we delivered to date. I would remind you that we have a 100% success rate of FDA approval once we enter the clinic. And with $10 billion in cumulative biosimilar sales through '24, we're on track to double 2021 sales to over $4 billion by the end of the decade. I think this reinforces our leadership and ability to deliver attractive returns. So it's a really important question. We're delighted and we think this is a good use of shareholder capital. Operator : Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Conor MacKay : This is Conor MacKay on for Evan. Congrats on the quarter. We just had one question on the Phase III ROCKET program. With several readouts coming over the balance of the year, what are you looking to see from those readouts to get comfortable with your competitive positioning in the atopic dermatitis market? And sort of any updated thoughts on how you're thinking about that? James Bradner : Thanks for the question. Rocatinlimab, our T-cell rebalancing monoclonal antibody targets the OX40 receptor. As you note, is -- we are reading out this year a number of studies of this ROCKET program. This eighth study, more than 3,300 patient program really gives a lot of granularity, to answer your question, around the target product profile, the safety and tolerability of rocatinlimab and its full efficacy in patients with atopic dermatitis in the SHUTTLE study. We study rocatinlimab combination with topical steroids or calcineurin in adults with moderate-to-severe AD, data first half of this year. In the IGNITE study, we study monotherapy in adults with moderate-to-severe data first half of this year. And then in the back half of the year, we have 2 studies : ASCEND and ASTRO. ASCEND will help us understand maintenance in adults and adolescents. And then ASTRO is an adolescent study with moderate-to-severe AD. And so as you can tell, we're going to generate a lot of information about the potential to contribute to a better therapy for this very common in many cases, morbid disease as well as the tolerability profile. Operator : Our next question will come from Gregory Renza from RBC Capital Markets. Gregory Renza : Bob, as you and the team talk about the global footprint and leveraging and penetrating new markets, I'm just wondering if you could comment a bit about the opportunity in China and namely, just about the commercial opportunity for those oncology medicines and how that's being achieved through your partnership with BeiGene. And maybe just longer term, how is that BeiGene or BeOne arrangement just factoring into those longer-term goals? Robert Bradway : Maybe we'll take it in 2 parts. Let me just at the high altitude reiterate what I said at the beginning, Gregory, which is that the business is growing globally. All 3 of our geographic regions are growing. Our Japan, Asia Pacific business is the most rapidly growing of our regions right now. So we're really pleased with the performance in Japan and China and elsewhere in the region. And the collaboration with BeiGene continues to go well. And Murdo, feel free to jump in and address any specifics about the portfolio there and plans. Murdo Gordon : Yes. Both elements of our business in China are performing well. The Amgen-affiliate business is growing nicely. That's essentially Repatha and Prolia, both products doing well, both products listed on the national reimbursement drug list and growing rapidly, as Bob described. And with BeOne, formerly BeiGene, our partnership, I think, has exceeded our expectations in China. The team executed extremely well across KYPROLIS, BLINCYTO and XGEVA. And we continue to enjoy that partnership and feel good about it. And obviously, we continue to work closely with them on the other R&D projects that we've partnered on. So overall, pleased with that. Operator : Our last question will come from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit Bansal : I have a question regarding denosumab and mostly just a franchise, mostly in the sense of how should we think about the cadence of a biosimilar erosion with the biosimilars coming? I'm assuming it is more back-half loaded, but would love to get any color how you are thinking about that. Robert Bradway : Sure. Murdo, want to address that for Mohit? Murdo Gordon : Yes. Thanks, Mohit. Well, we have a bit of a clearer understanding on the timing of when biosimilars will enter given the settlements we've reached. So I would agree that the slope of the biosimilar erosion is going to be, by definition of the timing, more towards the back end. I would just encourage everybody to remember the cadence of biosimilar erosion in general. And the fact that we've got 2 slightly different situations here with XGEVA largely used in the oncology setting and Prolia used in postmenopausal osteoporosis. So the slopes there could be different. But overall, we are in a good position given our participation in the biosimilar market. It teaches us lessons on how to defend successfully on the innovator side. And so we have a fairly large team of account executives that have been calling on our XGEVA and Prolia accounts for many years now. And we are the bone market leader. And so there's a certain incumbency that we have that we think positions us well to defend against other biosimilar competition as they enter the market. Robert Bradway : Okay. Well, thank you all for your interest, and I appreciate you joining the call. We look forward to catching up after the next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our 2024 Q4 and full year earnings call. You may now disconnect.",
