My name is Ellen, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Bill Franklin, Investor Relations. Mr. Franklin, you may begin. Bill Franklin : Thank you, Ellen. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us on this afternoon\u2019s call. Let me start on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which is on our website and we will be referring to during the call. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC today in an 8-K report, and in our 10-K, which are on our website and on file with the SEC. In the first quarter 2014 earnings materials, which are posted on our website and have been furnished to the SEC, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Our call this morning will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for question-and-answer session. Now it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to David. David Nelms : Thanks, Bill. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Since I recently presented Discover\u2019s strategic priorities and key initiatives at our annual financial community meeting, I\u2019ll keep my prepared remarks brief on today\u2019s call. During the first quarter of this year, the actions and results that we drove help take us a step closer to achieving the priorities that I discussed at the event. Specifically, we grew card receivables by nearly 5% which is at the upper end of our targeted range. We achieved this level of growth through wallet share gains with existing customers, and the continued success of Discover it, where we drove a double-digit increase in new accounts. We\u2019ve added innovative features like free FICO Scores on card member statements and continue to enhance our online application to drive new accounts. Card sales volumes growth in the quarter was 3%. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that the majority of sales growth in the industry at the moment is coming from high spend transactors, while profitability in the industry for the most part is still driven by receivables, not sales. Our card business is focused on prime revolver sales and we\u2019ve been taking share in this segment. Furthermore, we are not sacrificing quality to achieve growth as credit in our card business continues to remain exceptionally strong. Next, we continue to leverage our brand, our customer base and our risk management skills to profitably grow and expand our newer direct banking products. Private student loans excluding purchased loans grew by 26% during the quarter. And personal loans grew by 27%. In these businesses, we are not only driving solid growth, but we\u2019re also achieving great returns on equity. In addition, we are piloting our student loan consolidation product which we expect to further rollout later this year, and we\u2019re making good progress towards implementing the core banking system, which will better position us to more broadly launch our direct checking product later this year. In payments, we continue to increase global acceptance, enhance security and look for ways to partner to increase volume while navigating through some clear challenges in the segment. Despite these challenges in the payment segment, the first quarter overall was a great start to 2014. Our core lending business drove 6% receivables growth and 4% revenue growth. We generated $631 million in net income or $1.31 per diluted share with the return on equity of 23%. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark and he\u2019ll walk through the detail of our first question results. Mark Graf : Thank you, David, and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019ll start by going through the revenue detail. It\u2019s on Slide 5 of our earnings presentation. Net interest income increased $153 million or 11% over the prior year, due to continued loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total non-interest income decreased $67 million to $515 million, primarily due to lower direct mortgage-related income, and an increase in our rewards expense. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 103 basis points. Of this total, roughly 7 basis points or approximately $18 million was related to updating our assumptions to reflect lower reward forfeitures going forward. Excluding this one-time adjustment, our rewards rate for the quarter would have been 96 basis points. The decrease in forfeitures is driven by good credit performance and our efforts to increase either redemption like we\u2019ve done with Amazon to drive customer engagements. In terms of the more business as usual elements of the program, we modestly increased both the standard and promotional rewards over the prior quarter. Payment services revenue decreased 9% year-over-year, mainly due to lower transaction processing margins at PULSE, which will have somewhat easier comps next quarter as pricing changes were implemented during the first half of last year. Overall, we grew total company revenues by 4% in the quarter. Turning to Slide 6. Total loan yield of 11.44% was 22 basis points higher than the prior year, as interest yield for card, private student and personal loans all increased. The year-over-year increase in card yield reflects a higher portion of balances coming from revolving customers, as well as lower interest charge-offs. Higher total loan yield, combined with the lower funding costs, resulted in a 48 basis point increase in net interest margin over the prior year to 9.87%. Looking forward, we continue to expect net interest margin to remain elevated above our long-term target for sometime to come. Turning to Slide 7. Operating expenses were up $31 million or 4% over the prior year. The increase in employee compensation was primarily related to higher headcount to support growth and new product initiatives, as well as compliance with increased regulatory requirements. Information processing expenses were up $6 million or 8 %, largely due to a reclassification of expenses that were previously included in employee compensation and benefits in the second quarter of last year. Other expense was up $9 million or 10% due to the inclusion of a legal reserve release in the first quarter of last year. Payment services expense increased by $9 million or 23% due to ongoing Diners Club cost in Europe. For the quarter, our total company efficiency ratio was 37.7%, roughly in line with our long-term 38% target. Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 8. Provision for loan losses was higher by $113 million compared to the prior year, due to a smaller reserve release. Our $57 million reserve release for the quarter mainly reflects an improvement in both our contractual and bankruptcy loss assumptions for the card product. The credit environment for cards continues to remain extremely benign. Sequentially, the credit card net charge-off rate increased by 23 basis points to 2.32%. However it decreased by 4 basis points over the prior year. 30-plus day delinquency rate of 1.72% remained at the same level as the prior quarter. The private student loan net charge-off rate, excluding our purchased loans, increased 49 basis points from the prior year, due to a larger portion of the portfolio entering repayments. Student loan delinquencies, excluding acquired loans, increased 31 basis points to 1.79%. Overall, student loan portfolio continues to seize and generally in line with our expectations. Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was up 7 basis points sequentially and the over 30-day delinquency rate was down 2 basis points to 68 basis points. The year-over-year decrease in the personal loan charge-off rate was primarily driven by loan growth. Next, I\u2019ll touch on our capital position on Slide 9. Our Tier 1 common ratio increased sequentially by 60 basis points to 14.9%. This despite the flowing $400 million of capital through buybacks and dividends. As was previously announced on March 26, we received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve on our proposed capital action during the four quarters that will end of March 31 of next year. We were pleased with the outcomes in how we lined up versus other banks in terms of our capital ratios in the stress scenarios. Additionally, our board authorized a two-year $3.2 billion share repurchase program and last week increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.20 to $0.24 per share. Now that we\u2019ve completed our inaugural CCAR stress test, we\u2019re updating our Basel III Tier 1 common target to approximately 11%. Our prior Tier 1 common target was largely grounded in our economic capital framework. The new target is based on an analysis of our CCAR stress test result, which similar to other large banks has become our binding constraint. Just to remind you, this is largely an academic exercise at this point as we\u2019re well above our revised target and the current CCAR framework Discover just payouts greater than 100% of earnings. In summary, this was a solid start to the year. We once again drove better than industry receivables growth. Net interest margin and credit remained strong. And we increased our planned capital deployment. That concludes our formal remarks. So now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to our operator, Ellen, to open things up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) We ask that you please limit yourself to one initial and one follow-up question. The first question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hi Mark, good evening. Mark Graf : Hi Ryan. Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs : So, just on the decision to change the Tier 1 common target to 11%. Can you just give us some context towards how you came up with the decision? This is obviously just your first year going through the CCAR, and I would have thought just given the experience that a lot of others have had that they taken a multiyear process before making a final decision in terms of the Tier 1 common target. So should we think about this as a potential to be a moving target over time, or you think this is something that will be more static and you\u2019ll continue to run within the longer term? Mark Graf : No, I think Ryan, it\u2019s a great question. I think it\u2019s definitely going to be a moving target over time, not something I would see as static. I think we had historically had prior guidance out there that was based on our economic capital framework that we withdrew after last year\u2019s CCAR results when we saw how other card players had performed, and we just said it looks to us like maybe in the current environment, the number might be a little bit higher. And we need to wait and see, because the new binding constraint will be the stress test results themselves. And I think the 11% number we\u2019re putting out to you today is really meant to be reflective of just that. The current environment and where things stand right now. I think it\u2019s intended to be dynamic. It should be dynamic. It should be driven by the mix of business, the business climate, the environment, lots of different things. So I would not assume it\u2019s a static 11%. Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Got it. And then given that you\u2019re still sitting here with over roughly 400 basis points of excess capital, above and beyond that level, and given the fact that it appears that the payout ratio will be south of 100% this time, it looks like you\u2019re going to probably continue to accrete capital from here. So just given that framework, is there any chatters overall across the industry potentially with the regulators about the ability to increase your capital of returns above 100%. And if so \u2013 if you were able to do so, what would be the method of preference would it be for incremental buyback or would you potentially think about something such as special dividend? Mark Graf : I\u2019ll refer to the regulars, the fed, in terms of what they\u2019re thinking about in terms of the payout ratios over the long haul. I mean there is always speculation in industry from time to time. And I hear some of that on my peers. I am sure you\u2019re hearing a lot of around the horn too, but I\u2019ll defer to them over as to what their thought process is. I think the CCAR process itself is designed to be a horizontal review. And at such point in time as the regulator is being capital to be rebuild in the industry, it would be our clear hope that the process could change somewhat in that regard, but at this point in time, the rules that we understand them still are kind of what we\u2019ve laid out there and that is that payout is greater than 100% are really discouraged in the current framework. Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs : And I might squeeze in one last one, just on the updated forfeiture costs. Is this something that we should think of as being one-time in nature, i.e. the 7 basis points is one-time. And how do we think about in the context of 1% targeted reward rate that you\u2019ve talked about in the full year? Mark Graf : Yes, great question. I would say the forfeiture rates re-impairment test or we cast that forfeiture assumption is a better way to describe it every six months, Ryan. And what we\u2019ve seen is in particular some of the popularity, the Pay with Cashback Bonus at Amazon and a few other features like that have driven a much higher propensity to utilize the cash back rewards. So we\u2019re not seeing as much forfeiture. In addition to that, the really high quality credit environment right now is meaning folks aren\u2019t forfeiting their cash back balances due to delinquency. So when we looked at that, there was basically a catch-up adjustment we made to reflect those things. So I would say yes. I view them as one-time in nature. Now again six months out, we\u2019ll look at them again but I don\u2019t \u2013 a crystal ball doesn\u2019t say some other giant adjustment six months from now as we sit here today. What I would say is that in terms of the 100% full year total rewards, Ryan, I would say yes, that still feels like about the right general ZIP code for where we\u2019re standing, maybe two or three basis points above or below that number somewhere in that generally is good. It\u2019s the way I think about the full year. So yes, I\u2019ll stand behind that one. Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Thanks for taking my questions. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : The next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead. Mark DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital : Yes, thanks. First question is just a follow-up on Ryan\u2019s first question. Mark, is the \u2013 I believe it was the 9.5% economic capital you have. Is that still longer term where you would hope that the standard will converge on when instead sorts of get a little bit less conservative as far as what they want relative to what they\u2019ve kind of the theoretical goal posts are? Mark Graf : Yes, the 9.5% we withdrew about a year ago. And yes, that was based on the economic capital, that\u2019s correct. I would say, look, based on an analysis of our economic capital position, it still strikes us that that would be reasonable place to operate the company over the long haul. I would say that process is obviously at this point in time, includes the federal reserve in the process. And they have a process that has imposed the binding constraint we have got today. And I want to be respectful of their role, the tough job they\u2019ve got to play in rebuilding capital in the system post the crisis and everything else. So I think it\u2019s a tough job and the horizontal review process is not easy for them. They\u2019ve got to do it under Dodd-Frank. It\u2019s not an option. So again our hope would be overtime as capitals rebuild, the process will liberalize a little bit. I think it\u2019s here to stay, but we\u2019re hopeful we\u2019ll be able to liberalize. And that 9.5% economic capital numbers still doesn\u2019t feel entire wrong to us. Mark DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on a separate note, my sense was from the Investor Day that you\u2019re still giving really good response to the offers you\u2019re spending on the Discovery card. I think you also alluded to a benefit to the yield from some of the higher propensity to revolve. If you get a continued increase in that propensity to revolve along with strong response rates, could we see card loan growth in excess of the kind of 5% high end of your targeted range? David Nelms : Well, as I mentioned Mark, we have achieved double-digit new account growth in the first quarter of this year compared to a year ago. So we\u2019re continuing to see good responses. And I would say that the pickup that we saw in year-over-year growth from around 3% to between 4% and 5%, I think already reflects that success. And so we are very focused on trying to put in additional things that will help keep us near the high-end of that 2% to 5% range. And I am just really pleased that we achieved that high-end this quarter. Mark DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay, great. Thanks for your comments. Operator : The next question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities : Thank you. Mark, I was hoping that you could talk about the dynamics that we\u2019re currently seeing in consensus expectations which have your provision expense increasing 58% between 2013 and 2015, where your loan is only growing by 9% over that timeframe. Is it reasonable for growth in your provision line to outpace your loan growth by that much, particularly given that the reserve building that you\u2019ve been doing has been growth-driven, and in this quarter you actually had another release? As we look ahead, how should we be thinking about the pace of reserve building in relation to your loan growth? Mark Graf : Yes, I would say there is lot in that one Bill. I\u2019ll try and hit it all. If I don\u2019t, feel free to come back at me on some pieces if I miss it. I guess what I would say as with respect to how consensus were looking at, I\u2019ll defer on that one because that\u2019s obviously how you guys were looking at it. So you probably have a better sense on that one than I do. I guess what I would say is that the crystal ball right now gives us pretty good visibility into the 12-month forward loss emergence period. In that window, we do not see any type of deterioration in the consumer credit markets in which we play at this point in time. The environment continues to be very benign. We\u2019d expect provisioning to be largely a function of growth going forward, to the extent that there is adds to the provisions, to the extent there is releases, we\u2019d expect them to be from continued surprises to the good. This most recent quarter both our contractual and our bankruptcy loss assessments in our modeling improved. And I think that affected both, not only the number of accounts but also the average balances. So I mean it\u2019s pretty broad-based improvement we saw across the board. So relative to the $1.6 billion in allowance or so that we\u2019ve got on the books, a modest relief, a modest bill as I kind of view it as variability around a flat reserve more or less over the course of the last quarter or two, but I don\u2019t see anything over the course of the next 12 months beyond growth in loans that would be a sizable driver of provision expense. Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities : So to the extent that maybe you had a little bit lower recoveries that could be something that contributes to the provisioning maybe exceeding loan growth a bit, but by and large, provision growth should roughly be similar to loan growth. Is that reasonable to expect at least for the next year? Mark Graf : Yes, I mean I think I got to be little careful with that one because obviously the provision growth can be driven by one, our model shell. And those models get updated every quarter. But I would say as a general process, I think the framework we\u2019re thinking about and you\u2019re expressing is not a bad one. Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities : Okay, great. And then separately there is a follow-up. There has been some commentary during this quarter\u2019s earnings calls suggesting that there are issuers out there who are willing to raise rewards to levels that are basically wiping out any interchange revenues that they generate. I wondered if you could comment on the extent to which you\u2019re seeing any competitive pressure from these types of aggressive reward campaigns. And maybe more broadly, if you guys could talk about how sustainable these elevated rewards are that we\u2019re seeing today across the industry, particularly some of the relatively high cash back rewards offers that are out there? David Nelms : Well, I think that there is \u2013 we\u2019ve seen over many years where letters with come in with high rewards and then we\u2019ll pair them back. So I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s very different. And I think you kind of see people coming and rotate in and out. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t characterize now it\u2019s having an unusual number of people coming in with our rewards costs. I think some people are getting more aggressing and some people are backing off because they are running the numbers from last year\u2019s programs. I think if you look at what we\u2019re doing apart from the sort of one-time adjustment, we still were just under 100 basis points. We\u2019ve been around a 100 points for a while. That was sufficient to drive industry leading growth. In receivables and growth in revenue, actually an expansion in net interest margin. So we are very focused on growing total profitability and profitable loans, not just short-term drilling rewards expenses out. Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities : It\u2019s very helpful. And if I may just a last one very quickly. What kind of ROE does your 11% common equity Tier 1 target represent? And then that\u2019s it. Thank you. Mark Graf : Yes, I\u2019d say we haven\u2019t specifically translated that one publicly before, but certainly well north of that 15% number that is sort of our threshold level we put out there on our guidance previously. Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities : Thanks. Mark Graf : Yes. Operator : The next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Good evening guys. David Nelms : Hi David. David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank : I was looking at your expenses, it seem pretty clean this quarter outside some seasonal prime marketing and maybe a little bit of Diners cost. If I annualize that run rate, I would still get maybe three-ones. If I had a little bit of marketing, still relatively large delta versus your $3.3 billion, end of your target. I know you\u2019re building in some compliance regulatory costs and maybe some technology investments. How much are those in the run rate and then kind of what\u2019s the timing on that throughout the course of the year? Mark Graf : Yes, I would say it\u2019s going to ebb and flow David a little bit quarter-over-quarter. I think I\u2019d probably point you back to the Investor Day commentary where I kind of said $3.3 million sort of felt like the right number for full year expenses. I would say \u2013 and based on everything I know right now, I wouldn\u2019t revise that guidance. If you were in Investor Day today, I\u2019ve still pretty much think that\u2019s held pretty good. I think we feel pretty strongly that the last two quarters we\u2019ve slipped to flat to positive operating leverage with revenue growth in line with or exceeding our expense growth, which feels very good to us. We\u2019ve remained committed to consistently delivering positive operating leverage and that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re headed. David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. So another one on loan growth. It seems like some competitors are increasing credit lines or adjusting those for some of their customers. Is that something you guys have relatively been stable in your credit line you would have increases but that\u2019s something that you get use as a lever for loan growth going forward? David Nelms : I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent on that. Right after the crisis, we curtailed a lot of line increases, but at this point we restore things and we\u2019re a couple of years into a fairly stable situation of raising lines when appropriate. David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And one more on the CCAR results for the loss rates. It seems like 15%, obviously the high end of the industry but versus your internal projections, was there a large delta there, and can you comment on the different [ph]. David Nelms : So I think David you can see our \u2013 we published our forecast for the losses and the supervisory stress scenario on I think it was March 26. So you can see the differences there. We can\u2019t explain the differences between the two, because there is not really that much insight that\u2019s given to how the fed comes up with their loss estimates. David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay, thanks for taking the questions. David Nelms : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Thank you. I guess I got one on capital and one on the network business. Just assuming the bulk of the excess capital is trapped, how aggressively are you looking for alternative uses? And I guess secondly on the network business, I guess intra-quarter we found out who the third-party issuing client was that left. Could you just talk about the prospects for that third-party business and broadly the \u2013 I am sorry the third-party issuing business and maybe the third-party segment broadly as well? Thank you. Mark Graf : Yes, I\u2019ll tackle how aggressively part and then I\u2019ll pass it to David to talk about the network piece. I would say Sanjay, we are always actively looking for ways for capital to work to the benefit of our shareholders. So you should I think see if we assume we are always scanning a horizon for ways to do just that. I think organically we\u2019re already outgrowing our key competitors out there in all of our core product lines and it feels like we\u2019re doing very good job of that. I\u2019d say when it comes to the inorganic opportunities in that front too, we\u2019re also always very actively scanning and looking for the right opportunities, balancing that against wanting to make sure that the capital doesn\u2019t burn a hole on our pocket so to speak. And I think the phrase I\u2019ve used before is if a deal doesn\u2019t make sense, we won\u2019t try to make it to make sense. And I think there is things shown around on the streets from time to time, but there is disconnect between value in buyers mind from sellers minds. And I am not going to do something that doesn\u2019t make sense for my shareholders just to do it. So but rest assured, we clearly understand, we have more capital sitting around than our shareholders would like us to. We remain committed to our prioritization which would be organic redeployment, returning it and inorganic redeployment in that order. And we are going to stay diligently focused on that. David Nelms : And Sanjay, obviously they want to bring that \u2013 represented the lion\u2019s shares and network partners volume of profits, but was an immaterial benefit before our currently paid EPS overall. But frankly, we had to look at the renewal and the renewal structure simply didn\u2019t meet our profit hurdles. So it would have gone from positive to a negative. And so that obviously didn\u2019t make sense for our shareholders. If you look at where we\u2019ve been focused in the last couple of years, it\u2019s actually been not on deals like that but on non-traditional deals. So I point you to the various network-to-network deals. The various deals like the Ariba, PayPal and others with some other emerging partners, and as well as continuing the focus on debit where we\u2019ve got a strong market position in terms of market share. And so we\u2019re pretty pleased with the deals there, but it takes a while for volumes to profits of new deals to take the place. That\u2019s something that\u2019s much more maturity of going to going away later this year. Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: And one follow-up if I may to Mark\u2019s comments. Just in terms of places where you\u2019re looking at where the prices might not make sense. I mean could you just talk about what those areas are? That would be helpful. Thank you. Mark Graf : Sure. I guess, Sanjay, the way I think about it as you were talking the balance sheet business, you\u2019re looking at assets that are consumer-oriented assets in nature, assets that are actuarially I would say for lack of a better term underwritten and managed as opposed to big lumpy exposures. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see us run out and start doing C&I lending or commercial real estate lending next quarter. I think I would stick to more granular consumer or consumer-like type portfolios would be the way I think about that. And obviously I think my earlier comment, I think our crystal ball shows an ability for us to keep driving great ROEs right now as we look forward. And rushing out and trying to make one of those work, when it\u2019s not the right strategic fit and/or the pricing isn\u2019t right in this environment. I think we want to be responsible stewards of our shareholders capital, and we\u2019re going to do the right things. Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Great. Thank you. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : The next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup: Yes, David. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about spend during the quarter and into April, and then also briefly on the CFPB if there is anything going on there, or is it fairly stable? David Nelms : Well, on spend volume, we have seen some pick up in the last several weeks. And I think we\u2019re going to have to see some more data points to see if that\u2019s sustained or not, but at least maybe as the weather finally gets a little bit better, that is potentially helping. In terms of CFPB, there is really nothing new. I mean there is always reviews, there is the one \u2013 we\u2019ve continued to maintain a good working relationship. The one matter that we disclosed that we\u2019re still working already through. We don\u2019t really know exactly where that will come out, but we look forward to resolving that as soon as we can. We\u2019ll let you know as soon as there is more that we can say. Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup: Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Brad Ball with EverCore. Please go ahead. Brad Ball \u2013 EverCore Partners : Hi, yes, Mark, really two questions on the margin. One, sort of over the nearer term. Is there room for further funding cost benefits as you continue to drive more direct consumer in affinity deposits. And drives the margin even higher. And then secondly longer term, what is it that keeps you locked on your long-term margin guidance which I think is 8.5% to 9%. What gets us back down to that level? Is it higher funding costs, or is it competition, depleting asset yields. How do you foresee? I know you can\u2019t really give us timing, but how do you foresee getting to that lower level? Mark Graf : I appreciate your addition of the timing point there. I appreciate that, very nice, but I am happy to tackle it. I guess I would say in the near-term, Brad, what we\u2019re doing is two different things. We\u2019re capturing and taking advantage of refinancing, albeit lesser volumes, but still not immaterial volumes of fundings. They were put on place several years back. Refinancing those at current lower rate in today\u2019s environment. What we\u2019re also doing now is we\u2019ve begun to really extend out the duration and the maturities of that funding. So for example, we did about $400 million with a 12-year bank notes in March at a very attractive fixed coupon. So some of what we\u2019re doing will actually benefit margins. So what we\u2019re doing will actually modestly take away from that benefit to margin. On balance in the near-term, is there is some potential modest upside in the margin? Yes, there is some potential modest upside in the margin, yes, in the near-term I would say. But we\u2019re not letting \u2013 it would be greater for a lack of a better way of saying and if we weren\u2019t positioning ourselves what to perform well in all environments. So from an asset liability perspective, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re not being pigs at the trough and just taking advantage of it all today, but there is opportunities with some more expansion there. In terms of longer term guidance, I think there is any number of things, credit normalization, increased interest rates. At some point in time even if we\u2019re extending out the duration of maturities of the funding, if and when that matures in a higher rate environment. I would say the biggest reason though is if I\u2019ve kept that guidance and we\u2019ve not been comfortable moving of it is \u2013 David has been pretty clear about our goals to become the leading direct consumer bank in the country. And I think part of what comes with that is diversification. And the other consumer asset classes we\u2019re not playing in today have lower yields than several of the ones we are playing in today. The good news is they also have lower loss rates. So on a risk-adjusted basis the returns they drive are very, very similar but they would \u2013 that further expansion would be diluted to margins. So that\u2019s the biggest reason we\u2019ve kept it in tact. Brad Ball \u2013 EverCore Partners : Okay, that\u2019s great. And then my one quick follow-up is on the Diners expense this quarter. Are we getting to the tail-end of that incremental Diners cost in Europe, or are we looking at that likely to continue over the next few quarters? Mark Graf : I would say you should expect it will continue over the next couple of quarters. It\u2019s really being driven by the business we acquired in Europe, the Italian Diners franchisee and the processor related there too. I am not so sure I would take that number and make that number a run rate. I\u2019d give you that guidance, but I would also expect there will be some drive that comes with that business for the foreseeable future. Brad Ball \u2013 EverCore Partners : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Craig Maurer with CLSA. Please go ahead. Craig Maurer \u2013 CLSA: Yes, hi. Would it be correct to assume that if you\u2019re seeing increased spend volume over the last few weeks as the weather improved that\u2019s coming with increased demand for lending or accelerating of loan growth? And secondly, with respect to PayPal, and assuming that they are yet to show any understanding of what a value proposition would need to be at a physical point of sale, would it be fair to characterize that your belief in their growth is now switched to a hope for growth? David Nelms : Well, I think on the second one you need to talk to PayPal. I wouldn\u2019t comment. We value PayPal as a partner. We still are very optimistic in the long-term, but what I would say is that, they are going to continue to test and learn and develop and where we exactly start and where we exactly end. As you would expect its marks [ph] will change. And you are seeing that with all the other players in the space as well whether it\u2019s Amazon or Google or Apple or they\u2019re all changing as time goes past. In terms of the first question\u2026 Mark Graf : Sales outlook [ph]. David Nelms : I would say we already feel really good about our loan growth accelerating to nearly 5% this quarter. If I can keep it at that level, I\u2019d be thrilled. I would not get ahead of myself and say, it\u2019s going to necessarily accelerate from here. I\u2019d love to see a little more acceleration in our sales growth. And while I feel really good about it if we continue to see a little pick up in retail sales more broadly in the economy. And maybe that our sales and our balance growth move closer to being in line versus sales be in a little bit [indiscernible]. Craig Maurer \u2013 CLSA: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Hi. Couple of questions. One was follow-up to the NIM discussion. I know you\u2019ve had high APR balances and have been trading down but very, very slowly. So I was just wondering, A, what\u2019s driving. Why did this slow and then B, are you assuming your normalized NIM outlook that \u2013 or your long-term NIM outlook, I should say that those high ARP balances have already traded? Mark Graf : Yes, so Betsy, if you look at the higher rates buckets, it\u2019s down to somewhere on the nature, I may have it little wrong but I am really close. I think about 16% of the total above give or take, somewhere in that and I think it\u2019s maybe 15%. A big chunk of that is cash advance balances, the rate on which is not covered or regulated on the CARD Act. So the amount of high rate balances left to a trade is relatively modest, and I\u2019d be honest in telling you that the bucket is getting replenished somewhere near about as fast as to trading. So it seems to be approaching a point of stability. It will decline from here a little bit more, but relative stability in that regard. So I think the high rate balances that are trading are not having the same including the factors that we were fighting here a year or two ago. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Because it\u2019s [indiscernible]. Mark Graf : Yes, exactly right. So it feels like we\u2019re approaching a point of state to spare at least for now. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re all the way there yet necessarily, but it feels like we\u2019re getting somewhere close to that. And I apologize, I\u2019ve forgotten second part of the question. David Nelms : Our long-term loans targets, do we assume more run-off? Mark Graf : The long-term target, do we assume more run-off. Now the same thing. It\u2019s basically just assumes we\u2019re reaching a point of spaces there more or less, but it projects that there will be some continued run-off from here. Yes, I mean it\u2019s again that longer term NIM target is really driven by the mix shift that we anticipate seeing overtime as we broaden the base of assets. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. And so consumers already shouldn\u2019t have product and grows as they seek that type of financing and it can go up as well. So that\u2019s not on your base case. Mark Graf : Correct. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. Then second question just on the other income line. Could you help us understand how is that mortgage-related revenues and could you speak to the thought process around portfolio-ing mortgages and is there an acceleration time? Mark Graf : Sure. I would say with respect to the portfolio-ing of mortgages, I would say I don\u2019t see that any time in the near-term in our current business plans. I think our cost of capital is in the particularly efficient place to hold a market price asset shall we say of that within a spread. So we probably aren\u2019t the most efficient holder for portfolio mortgages. We do from time to time contemplate with every service RM [ph] product. They\u2019ll read that as me telegraphing or going into servicing next week by any stretch of the imagination. It\u2019s just something we do consider to control the customer experience. I think we\u2019re very proud of the customer service we provide. And our ability to keep driving that forward is something that\u2019s very important to us. With respect to the decrease in other income and how much of it is related to the mortgage business. I was in the mortgage business is the biggest single component of that decrease in other income. David Nelms : Year-over-year. Mark Graf : Yes, year-over-year. And it\u2019s about probably plus or minus, let\u2019s call it between $30 million and $40 million year-over-year decline in that line item that\u2019s driven by the mortgage business. So as I\u2019ve kind of guided and as David guided you all to historically I would say, we bought the business because we wanted to be in the asset class. We purposely got it small. So in the good days maybe we were creating a penny or so a share to income overtime on a quarterly basis. And maybe today, we\u2019re taking away penny a quarter per share give or take something like that. So it\u2019s not really a material driver of the earnings stream today and feels like a place we want to be playing some type of a role as part of our goal to become that leading direct consumer bank, but growing it before we figured out the right formula for it doesn\u2019t make sense. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. So that too is kind of steady state in terms of seeing adjustment that you want to make there? Mark Graf : Yes, I think if we saw the right opportunity to penetrate more deeply to purchase mortgage market I think as team, we\u2019d be prepared to make the investments for the right opportunities. But I think again in this environment, we need to see the clear path of doing that. We\u2019re not going to just throw money at it to see if it works. We have to see a clear path of that being a good investment decision. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Chris Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead. Chris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Hi good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask on the marketing side. As I look at the last three quarters, you\u2019re basically flat year-on-year with marketing expense, and this is at the same time if you\u2019re launching some new products. So I am wondering, has there been some shift in your marketing spend either call it class marketing versus branding or maybe some shift in the channels where you\u2019re advertising that you\u2019re finding more efficient place to do your marketing like internet versus direct mail? Just curious on how you\u2019re keeping your marketing so steady year-on-year? David Nelms : Well, we\u2019re certainly trying to be efficient with our marketing. And in terms of the first part of your question, I mean we\u2019ve kind of had a series of new products. I mean we launched, Discover it, last year. We recently added free FICO Scores on statements. We\u2019re continuing to have maybe you wouldn\u2019t call them total new product launches, but significant product development and that are newsworthy, and frankly that\u2019s one of the reasons that our ad dollars and our marketing dollars go further because we have real news to tell consumers subscribe their name. And we\u2019re going to continue to do that. At the same time we are getting better and better at internet and a direct digital marketing. And you\u2019re seeing us do more and more in that space a very high percentage around new applications are coming there. And we\u2019re continuing to fine tune I mentioned the new application that is having a better click-through and completion rates. So we continue to try to take steps to make our marketing dollars go further. Chris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Okay. And then\u2026 Mark Graf : One thing I would like to add just to make sure we\u2019re all levels, that is, if we saw the right opportunities that we\u2019re going to drive the right kind of returns, this is a team that will invest if we had the right opportunities, right. And I think certain of our competitors have basically pulled way back on marketing spend and that\u2019s probably \u2013 unless we saw diminishing returns from it, not somewhere we\u2019d be right now. Chris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Okay. And then just shifting gears. So something else that had been disclosed in your 10-K about the FDIC notification about potential program efficiencies on AML, BSL, if there is just any updates there or anything to say? David Nelms : No, there is not an update. We\u2019re continuing much as I mentioned with the CFPB. They have a very collaborative working relationship and we\u2019ll let you know more if and when we get to the point where we can reach closure and let you know how things turn out. Chris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Got it. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research : Hi good evening guys. David Nelms : Hi Brian. Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research : I guess just on \u2013 most of my questions have been asked, but maybe on deposits. Can you remind us kind of as we been flat for a while, how much of that is just using to legacy higher rates stuff go versus how much of that is increased competition in the marketplace? David Nelms : I\u2019d say it\u2019s all the former from our perspective. Well we have been reasonable stable after a period of very rapid growth, within that when we talked about some in Investor Day, we\u2019ve significantly remixed and have carefully gone through the portfolio and have been maybe less aggressive on pricing and more aggressive on the most profitable parts of that to position ourselves for rising rate environment to make sure we\u2019re with core customers. But one of the most important factors is that its heavily cross-sell. And I think last year, about 50% of that total book has actually came from cross-sell as opposed to new customers to the franchise. Last year was about 70% cross-sell. And so we think that turning this into really all core deposits is very important. I think going forward, the big thing is checking account. That\u2019s not going to change the mix dramatically or add to balances dramatically in the near-term, but in the long-term that is very strategic for us because that is fairly relationship driven, and we think we have a very differentiated product with no fees, rewards and mobile capabilities that are unmatched. But if these are sticky, it will take time but that in the long-term is where we\u2019d love to see some growth. Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research : And just maybe one follow-up. There is a separate question. I feel like I\u2019m asking something that\u2019s already been asked, but just as I look through these loan yields, I keep waiting for the mix shift in competition to bring them down, and it\u2019s the only thing that keep going up. So you kind of touched on how couple of different things happening in different corners [ph] but were you surprised by how well the loan yields evolved, how to adopt this cycle and is there anything identifiable in the near-term that would change that? David Nelms : Well, remember there is an interaction with loan losses. And so loan credit losses means we were charged-off interest. And so to some degree a new normal in credit will be a new normal resulting some new normal in NIM. The second thing I would point out is that things are a bit different from card \u2013 as a result of CARD Act. And as you know, one of the key attributes of CARD Act is you really can\u2019t change, and I think change rates down the road. And so I think people maybe are a little more careful about going in with too low of a rate upfront. And so it\u2019s keeping their competition much more disciplined. And maybe in past cycles there might have been rate decreases now, but once you decrease you can never go back up. And so I think that is keeping a certain amount of discipline in the marketplace. And I think that would be here to stay. Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research : Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead. Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair : Thank you, good afternoon. I just want to clarify, I think you said that the new accounts in credit cards were up 10% year-over-year. Is that right? Mark Graf : I said double-digits. Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair : Double-digit\u2026 Mark Graf : I didn\u2019t say the exact percentage. Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair : Okay. And then maybe what drove when you had flat marketing as was earlier pointed out, what drove the double-digit? And is the Discover it at all changing the demographics of the customer base. So what\u2019s driving that growth? Is it continuing? Is it sustainable, and is that product changing the demographics of Discover customers somewhat? David Nelms : Well, I would point back to my earlier comments about getting incremental improvements in our marketing effectiveness in the digital space as well as the introduction of the free FICO Scores, which is resonating well, as well as our great service. And I think we\u2019re doing a better and better job with getting the word out that we have a fantastic service. I think that we\u2019re seeing on balance a slightly younger attraction. And I think that would be consistent with being digital kind of focus. And frankly people that are a bit younger probably have greater appeal to the free FICO Scores because they may still be building their \u2013 their credit scores aren\u2019t as locked in after decades of behaviors. And that we\u2019re pleased with making our money go a bit further. Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair : And then on your redemption rate, I guess are taking the charge this quarter. I think the American Express has given out numbers. They are probably in the mid 90s on the redemption rate. What is the redemption rate for Discover? Is it similar to American Express? Is it much lower? Mark Graf : We\u2019re looking at each other across the table right now. I\u2019m not sure we probably disclose that one. What I would say is our goal would be to make sure our customers have the opportunity to avail themselves that Cashback Bonus to the greatest extent possible. I mean we are \u2013 we take actions on a regular basis like that they would Cashback Bonus at Amazon and other features to try and make that redemption very easy for the customer. We found it\u2019s driven dramatically increased engagement on the part of our customers. If you look at the receivables growth we\u2019ve had vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors, A, it\u2019s pretty significant and I think there is a reason they are choosing to build those receivables with us. And I would say if you looked at the components of that 5% receivables growth, when you look at the first quarter, basically all that growth was standard merchandize sales, all right. I mean there was not a significant amount of VT [ph] in the component. There was not a significant amount of promotional merchant component. It\u2019s basically standard merchandize. We\u2019re getting to see old-fashioned way and that\u2019s the best most profitable time. So it feels really good. David Nelms : It is in that general ZIP codes. And it\u2019s been hard for quite sometime and that\u2019s partly how we designed it. It\u2019s cash. It\u2019s not points. We tried to have \u2013 make it \u2013 as a competitive advantage make it easier to redeem. We tried to have minimal brokerage. What we see as the payback is not in the brokerage but in increased usage. And so it\u2019s a high percentage. Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair : And then on the last question \u2013 last question if I could sneak in on the leading direct consumer bank focus. Is there a \u2013 to accelerate the view, I mean you\u2019re trading at 11x earnings. It\u2019s been a great stock and earnings have gone up. And I\u2019m sure investors aren\u2019t complaining about the stock, but mid-regional banks are putting it 15x earnings. And you\u2019re really in a sweet spot of banking, I mean people are closing branches, not opening branches and you have a good brand and position. Is there a way to accelerate that view, I mean to grow the checking, the deposit? Is there some M&A that possibly would bid with your franchise that maybe accelerate the checking account, the growth of checking accounts or other products for Discover? David Nelms : Well, I think checking in particular, I am not sure who one would acquire because I think we\u2019re with the leading edge there. Arguably I think there are some that have done a good job, USAA is one I would point to, because they\u2019re with a more focused customer base, but they\u2019ve done a great job on service and actually getting people to use out as their checking \u2013 having the primary checking account. But there is \u2013 I think generally we would consider other ways to accelerate our growth, but there is not a lot of direct players out there in any of our asset classes that one would think about being able to acquire. I mean student loans can certainly fit that criteria a few years ago and you saw us take action. So we have done things to accelerate were appropriate, and we always looked, but we would have to make sure it was something that did the strategy. Most of what would be out there would be branch banks which isn\u2019t as you said direct banking. Bob Napoli \u2013 William Blair : Thank you very much. David Nelms : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital. Please go ahead. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to start off, I am trying to just go back to your commentary, Mark, about the loss reserves and where they should be expected to trend and then also the provisions. And I am trying to just frame this in my mind, get to help you better quantify the thinking around provisioning would be related to growth, but if I look at your \u2013 I go back of Q1 of 2012, I annualize your charge-off, say in the credit card business and then I subtract from that what you had in reserves associated with the card portfolio and divide that by the average loan balance in that portfolio. There is a gap of about \u2013 it comes out to me, the math looks that we were 100 basis points and I call that cushion if you will for lack of a better word. And then if you look at the same calculation of Q1 of 2013, that was about 60, 62 basis points. And then in the most recent quarter about 32 basis points. So am I correct in just running that calculation thinking that, okay, if were to use the term cushion for lack of a better word, the cushion is thinner now clearly as you\u2019ve gone down reserves and that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to be having more provision related to growth as opposed to having any additional opportunities to release reserves? Is that the right way of thinking about it? Mark Graf : No. I wouldn\u2019t think about in terms of that cushion \u2013 in terms of that thought process. I mean we don\u2019t \u2013 GAAP doesn\u2019t allow you to keep cushion per se. GAAP basically requires you to be pretty darn transparent about where you think losses are actually trending. And I can promise you there are regulators from multiple different regulatory bodies and external auditor who crawls all over those loss reserve models on a regular basis. So I wouldn\u2019t think about it in terms of there being some cushion put in there. I think, Sameer, in terms of where that trending goes from here, I would say loan growth is going to cause \u2013 you mean the components of it, what I can\u2019t do is tell you every quarter exactly how they are going to swing. But the components that we process do have to have a positive provisioning would be at least in the near-term those that are related to loan growth, growth in the balance sheet, growth in assets, because we don\u2019t see any significant turn in the overall environment for credit any time soon, okay. Another factor that would cause positive provisioning would be the student loan business, right. Our organic student loan business only 36% of that at this point of time is in repayment. So as that portfolio continues to seize in, that one will be driving modest additions. I think the flat score of the student loans was $9 million with loan loss reserve addition, if you will in the total calculation something like that. So those would be the two big factors that would cause positive provisioning. On the flip side of the equation, what in a stable credit environment or a nearly stable credit environment would cause you to have releases, I would say it would be for both bankruptcy and contractual accounts. What\u2019s our experience and hence our revised forecast based on that experience is for both, the average balances that will be impacted as well as the number of accounts that will be impacted. So if you have a situation where you see average balances are going down and you have a situation where you see the number of accounts being impacted are going down, that obviously helps. So that would be the component parts and pieces of the puzzle. Last couple of quarters, we saw slight increase in some of those numbers. This quarter we saw a decrease. Hope that\u2019s helpful. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital : That\u2019s helpful. I was looking only at your card business and I was just moving into baseline assumption that you have about 12 months of reserves of charge-offs in your reserves, and then looking at your run rate of charge-offs, I was trying to extrapolate from that, but you\u2019re color is very helpful. The other question is on a different note, your personal loan product, I mean clearly you\u2019ve had a lot of growth there. You\u2019ve been very successful. Now the other day in one of the newspapers, there was some discussion about a company called Lending Club, which seems to target prime customers specifically for purposes of refinancing on the higher cost credit card debt and other types of debt. I was curious, it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ve felt \u2013 I mean clearly, I mean portfolio is probably lot smaller than the card portfolio, but it seems like you\u2019re generating pretty healthy growth rates there, but do you come across this company? Do you \u2013 is it a different demographic from what you usually target, because it seems like the demographic was pretty similar. So I was just trying to reconcile your fast growth rates with the fact that there seem to be other competitors coming in specifically targeting that customer base? David Nelms : Well, from what I can tell, I would say the P2P companies are probably the leading competitors to what we\u2019re doing. And so we certainly are taking notice. From what I can tell, some of them tend to be a little broader in their credits than we are. We are quite focused on prime, and as opposed to sort of full spectrum on lending, but nonetheless I think some of them were doing some interesting things. And one of the things that we have done historically has been by invitation-only kind of marketing, and we are testing into this year at least considering the applications of people that are coming to us through the internet site from broad markets and may benefit from debt consolidation product. And that may bring us a little bit closer to some of the things that \u2013 space that they\u2019re in. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful, David. And just one quick one, I\u2019ll sneak it in there just to make sure, I mean it doesn\u2019t sound to me like you\u2019re opposed to buying portfolios of private student loans, clearly Sallie Mae bank will be a stand-alone entity that said they want to sell roughly about half of their production would be $2 billion in loans. Is that something you\u2019d be interested in, or should we assume that for now unless you\u2019re got a really compelling price, you\u2019re just going to focus some more on the organic growth? David Nelms : I mean I think if it was the portfolio \u2013 if the portfolio was available, we would simply run the numbers and decide if it was a good thing for shareholders and whether hurdles or not. I am not familiar with what Sallie may or may not do. I suspect that you\u2019re talking more about what they\u2019ll securitize versus keeping the balance sheet, which is probably something little different than buying whole loans but. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital : I think these are probably the whole loan sales. They originated about $4 billion a year and they plan to sell $2 billion to one of their other entities that\u2019s being spun out, but presumably they could also offer these out to the open market for other bidders to bid for these loans. So I was just curious if you\u2019d be interested in that or even philosophically as you pointed out, you just want to focus on your organic business. It sounds like if the price is right, you might probably be interested? David Nelms : Yes. Well, I would say the primary focus across all of our businesses is organic growth, and we\u2019re really pleased that we\u2019re achieving good organic growth. We would be open to things that fit the strategy and could accelerate that growth, but Sallie hasn\u2019t called me yet, so I couldn\u2019t comment on that specifically. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital : All right. Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from with Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rick Shane \u2013 JPMorgan: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. If we look at sort of the backdrop on what\u2019s happened in mortgage, I think it\u2019s fair to say that \u2013 you called a tailwind in the beginning if you didn\u2019t probably necessarily drove profit building a little bit quicker. You called it headwind over the last couple of quarters and I think the expectation is once you turn profitable in that business, it would have been steadily profitable. Two questions here. One is, you talked about the revenues, can you talk about the expense controls that you\u2019ve seen associated with mortgages you\u2019ve seen a slowdown. And following that, do you believe at current run rates, which I think are probably a realistic expectation going forward that that business can at least be modestly profitable? David Nelms : Well, I would say that you characterized it right. Things did better than expected in this way and a little worse than expected recently. I read somewhere that we\u2019re in a 17-year low on mortgage originations in total. And I am not sure I agree with your characterization is that business is steady, because it by nature tends to be cyclical. And I think we\u2019re in a particularly unusual tough cycle right at the moment. I think that the direct part of that business has tended to be more refinance focused. So it tends to be even more cyclical. And so I think in our long-term view, what we want to do is generate more first mortgage production which will be more stable. During the quarter, you saw us make at least one announcement on relationships with realtors and search properties that would help actually generate direct first mortgage origination. And I think that\u2019s indicative of some of what we want to do over the long-term is move to that more stable production model. We have also taken steps as everyone else has done to rationalize the excess capacity. In the industry, you have out to take expenses out. In the near-term, our objective is probably simply just to get back to breakeven. It\u2019s not costing us huge money right now but we do see a path to get to breakeven fairly quickly. And then after that the question is can we move it up to a long-term contributor. And then eventually to grow it to be in more substantial contributor. Rick Shane \u2013 JPMorgan: Got it. Great. Thank you very much. Well actually can I circle back on that? Can you talk a little bit about how much of the costs \u2013 I mean you basically showed a 50% year-over-year compression of revenues. And again totally understandable given where we are in the cycle. What do you think on an apples-to-apples basis the expense ratios down there? David Nelms : It\u2019s just not material unless to break out. As we\u2019ve said, we took cost down as well so that whole revenue didn\u2019t go up to the bottom line, but it was enough of a swing us from a modest profit to a modest loss. And I would just\u2026 Mark Graf : Yes. I would say, look, from my perspective the expense cut probably hasn\u2019t been as deep as the revenue loss just to be intellectually honest with you guys in here. I mean I think it needs to be one thing if we had a big stable business that was operating at giant scale. Yes, you take out all the expenses and you\u2019d be ready to rock and roll. We\u2019re actually trying to figure up what the right role for us in this business is and how to play it the right way. So we\u2019re looking for opportunities to penetrate purchase money mortgage channel as David alluded to earlier a number of different things. So we\u2019re not going to cut to the bone, but by the same again if we\u2019re not going to be improving in terms of how we manage the business either, we\u2019re going to be smart about it, but we want to find a way to make this a contributing business that really adds value to our customer relationships going forward. So yes, we\u2019ve taken a red pencil to it, but we are also not focused on just slashing it, we want to find a way to make it work. David Nelms : One other thing I would add is that we have diverted some of the resources in that business into our new home equity product that we launched late last year. And I think we\u2019ve got some early months of optimizing the process and still want to be fully reviewed [ph] that you start to think about scaling that business, but that\u2019s a business that I think is going to tend to be countercyclical with the core mortgage business. And as rates rise and as home equity starts to recover, I think there is going to be some very nice growth. And in contrast, the mortgage business, that very much lends itself to direct marketing. There is lot of first mortgage, versus second \u2013 versus is refinancing issue. We think we can compete robustly for a large percentage of that market. Rick Shane \u2013 JPMorgan: Terrific. Thank you guys. David Nelms : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scott Valentin \u2013 FBR Capital Markets : Good evening, and thanks for taking my question. David, you mentioned double-digit account growth with Discover \u2013 I guess overall double-digit account growth for credit cards. I am just wondering how that\u2019s progressed over time? You mentioned you launched some Discover it campaign about a year ago. Wonder if it\u2019s been consistent? If you\u2019ve seen acceleration in the pace of account additions? David Nelms : Well, we had increased our accounts from when we launched Discover it. And we\u2019re now on the one year anniversary of really launching Discover it broadly. So when we talk about double-digit, that\u2019s lapping the increases that we have in the initial launch of Discover it. Scott Valentin \u2013 FBR Capital Markets : Okay. And then just a follow-up question. You mentioned as more loans enter repayment, losses will go up in the student loan portfolio. Where do you see kind of \u2013 if you were to stabilize the portfolio, where would you see kind of losses over, say the lifetime of a loan percentage-wise? David Nelms : Well, I think as we\u2019ve talked about a few years ago, well we project lifetime losses of somewhere around 10% roughly a 10-year life on average with prepayments. And so you\u2019d expect it to be a little bit north of 100 basis points, but as we described to you before, the first two years of repayment typically you see half of the total of lifetime losses occur as people have to start the repayment and there at the early part of their career, and therefore have the lowest income generally. And so as people would expect, as we get more and more people that bubble going through the first two years of repayment, we would expect it to be well north of that 100 basis points and you\u2019re seeing that in our numbers. So it\u2019s tracking pretty much according to our expectations. Scott Valentin \u2013 FBR Capital Markets : Okay. Thanks very much. Mark Graf : Thank you. Operator : The final question comes from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research : Thanks. I just had two really short follow-up clarification questions. David mentioned before that the loss of the third-party issuing relationship would be immaterial. Was that immaterial to payment services income or to total company income, and when could that start to show up? David Nelms : The total company income. Obviously the volumes and the profits on the much smaller base of the third-party payments business is the lion\u2019s share of the one that the third-party. David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research : All right. And do you have a sense of when the conversions would start? David Nelms : We expect later this year. David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research : Okay. And then you were saying the lion\u2019s share of the network partners volume? David Nelms : Correct. David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research : All right. And payment services income has affected as well? David Nelms : The payment services income also has PULSE and Diners contributing to it. Yes, if you remember that network partners is the third component with the smallest portion of volume. David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research : Right. Thanks. And then just wonder if you could tell us how much lower you think protection products revenue can go? Are we getting close to trough do you think? David Nelms : Well, we have not restored marketing. And so you\u2019re going to see continued attrition. It maybe trading a little bit slower than we might have anticipated. We\u2019re seeing some very nice loyalty and customers, and maybe that\u2019s inside the target reach, maybe helping because those securities attributes can be pretty valuable to people. But it\u2019s going to continue to trade until we restore marketing. David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research : Okay. And then I don\u2019t know, I might have missed it, but Mark did you gave an estimate of what you think your Tier \u2013 your Basel III Tier 1 common ratio as of March 31? Mark Graf : No, we didn\u2019t but it\u2019s only off by maybe 10 or 12 basis points from our current stated Tier 1 common equity level. So it does not \u2013 implementing Basel III does not have a material impact on us. David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research : Thanks a lot. David Nelms : Thank you, David. Operator : That was the final question. Ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Bill Franklin. Bill Franklin : Thank you for joining us this evening. If you have any follow-up questions, Investors Relations will be around this evening. Have a good night. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Discover Financial Services first quarter 2014 earnings call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Bakiba and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Bill Franklin. Bill Franklin, you may begin. William Franklin : Thank you Bakiba. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin as always with slide two of our earnings presentation, which is on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Q which are on our website and on file with the SEC. In the second quarter 2014 earnings materials which are posted on our website and have been furnished to the SEC we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussions. Our call this afternoon will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A period it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up, so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated. So now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David. David Nelms : Good afternoon everyone and thanking for joining us today. After the market closed we reported second quarter net income of $644 million or $1.35 per diluted share, up 13% over the prior year. This was driven primarily by profitable loan growth and share repurchases. We also continued to deliver strong performance with return on equity of 23%. Our direct banking business continues to deliver solid results and slide four of the earning presentation shows Discover\u2019s total loan growth of 7% over the prior year. This was driven by strong growth in card, personal loans as well as student loans. Card receivables growth of 6% this quarter continues to outpace our peers. We are achieving increased wallet share with existing customers and adding loans from new accounts as well. Our Discover card sales growth also accelerated to 6%. The overall value proposition of Discover continues to resonate with customers as evidenced by another quarter of double-digit new account growth year-over-year. Additionally, we added some new designs for the card and we rolled out a new cash back reward card primarily to appeal to students. Speaking of students, during the second quarter we enhanced our student loan products by introducing a 1% cash reward for students who achieved good grades. Additionally, in the quarter we announced new lower rates for students applying for loans. We launched an in-school repayment product and we began testing the consolidation student loan product, all of which are showing positive results to-date. Shifting gears, Discover was recently named the winner of three Call Center Excellence Awards by the International Quality and Productivity Center for demonstrating superior thinking, creativity and execution across the full spectrum of call center functions. I think this service excellence is one of the reasons why we have some of the lowest customer attrition in the industry. And to further enhance the customer experience we implemented our new core banking platform over Memorial Day weekend which supports all of our deposit products. The flexibility and the operational efficiencies that we expected to provide are fundamental to our vision to being the leading [direct] bank. Moving to our payment segment, volume increased by 3%. During the quarter, two of our newer emerging payment partners went live with transactions. However, I\u2019ll remind you that it will take some period of time for partners to achieve scale. As we have previously discussed, Pulse continues to deal with pressures on volume and margins due to competitive challenges in the debit industry. Despite two consecutive quarters of positive growth we learned that we would likely lose significant volume from a large debit issuer beginning in 2015. While the prospect of losing some business down the road is disappointing, this loss is not material relative to the profitability of the total company. With that said we are very pleased with the branding and superior returns that our network helps drive for our card business and we do remain focused on improving third party volume over the long term. Lastly, as we previously discussed in the second quarter we entered into a consent order with the FDIC related to our AML and BSA compliance programs. The order does not include any civil money penalties but provides for program enhancements. In addition, the Federal Reserve has recently notified us that it also intends to enter in to Supervisory Action with the company regarding our enterprise-wide AML and BSA compliance programs. We are committed to resolving these issues with the regulators in a timely manner. Before I turn the call over to Mark to walk through the details of our second quarter results let me say it that I am proud of our record rate EPS, card loan sales growth and our ability to continue to drive solid revenue growth with expense discipline. Mark? Mark Graf : Thanks David. I\u2019ll begin my comment today by going through revenue detail on slide five of our presentation. Net interest income increased $159 million or 11% over the prior year due to continued loan growth as well as higher net interest margins. Total non-interest income decreased $28 million to $583 million primarily due to lower direct mortgage-related income and lower protection product revenue. Given our suspension in protection product sales revenue related to these products continues to decline, albeit at a slower pace than initially expected. These items were partially offset by higher net discount and interchange revenue which increased by $19 million, or 6% year-over-year driven by higher Discover IT Card sales volume. Our reward rates for the quarter was 91 basis points which is higher than last year due to greater standard and promotional rewards, but down from last quarter which included a decrease in the expected forfeiture rate. Payment services revenue for the quarter was flat year-over-year. Overall, we grew total company revenues by 6% for the quarter. Turning to slide six, total loan yield of 11.42% was up 18 basis points over the prior year driven by higher card and private student loan yields. The year-over-year increase in card yield primarily reflects a higher portion of balances coming from revolving customers as well as lower interest charge-offs. The year-over-year increase in private student loan yield is the result of better than expected performance in certain acquired pools of loans. As we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, under PCI accounting favorability is recognized over the life of the underlying loans via an increasing yield and that\u2019s what happening here. Overall higher total loan yield combined with lower funding costs resulted in the 40 basis point increase in the net interest margin over the prior year to 9.84%. Turning to slide seven, total operating expense decreased by $23 million or 3% over the prior year, mainly due to the decline in other expense, which was somewhat offset by an increase in headcount and professional fees. The decline in other expense was caused by the absence of $40 million in Diner\u2019s Club charges which we incurred last year. For the quarter our total company efficiency ratio was below 37%, more than 1% lower than our long-term target, due in part to the timing of certain expenses throughout the year. Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on slide eight, provision for loan losses was higher by $120 million compared to the prior year due to a $23 million reserve build this quarter compared to a $78 million reserve release during the second quarter of 2013. The reserve build mainly reflects our continued card loan growth. Sequentially the credit card net charge-off rate increased by one basis point to 0.33% and the 30 plus day delinquency rate decreased by nine basis points to 1.63%. The private student loan net charge-off rate excluding purchase loans was down one basis points sequentially to 1.3% and the 30 plus day delinquency rate decreased by 13 basis points to 1.66%. Overall the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in-line with our expectations. Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was down 12 basis points sequentially to 1.95% and the over 30 day delinquency rate was down two basis points to 66 basis points. Overall we remain pleased with our strong credit results. One last item I would call out in the income statement is that during the quarter we had a favorable resolution to some outstanding tax matters. And as a result our 36.6% effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than anticipated. Next I will touch on our capital position on slide nine, our Tier 1 common ratio increased sequentially by 30 basis points to 15.2% due to solid earnings. During the quarter we repurchased $177 million of common shares. One of our top priorities is to drive shareholder value through effective capital management. To that end we still plan to repurchase a total of $1.6 billion of common shares for the four quarter period ending March 31, 2015, the same amount as our CCAR capital action submitted to the Fed. Also on slide nine is our outlook for 2014, which I would simply say remains relatively unchanged from the guidance we gave back in February at our financial community briefing. So to summarize, during the second quarter we continue to build on our momentum established at the beginning of the year. Discover drove better than industry loan growth, net interest margin continues to be above our long-term target, the credit environment remains benign and we are effectively controlling our expenses. That concludes our formal remarks today. So I will turn the call back to our operator, Bakiba to begin the Q&A session. Bakiba? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). And our first question is coming from the Mark DeVries from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mark DeVries \u2013 Barclays: Yeah, thanks. Question David, to what do you attribute the 6% card loan growth above the high end of your guidance? Is that, you\u2019re actually seeing signs of acceleration in spend across the industry or is it better than expected traction from the marketing of Discovery card? And then could you actually see it potentially remaining above that rate for the period, or is that a level growth that you at some level would think might outstrip kind of your desire to grow here? David Nelms : Well, to answer your second question we are not prepared to revise our 2% to 5% long-term target. I mean I am certainly pleased that we actually were a bit above that target this quarter. And I mean you\u2019ve just seen our various competitors announce and I\u2019d say generally I certainly didn\u2019t see that much signs of acceleration across the industry. So I think we continue to gain market share. So I would say that you mentioned the success of Discover IT, that is certainly contributing. But some of the other things that are contributing are lower charge-offs, less attrition, some wallet share build with existing customers as they respond to many programs and higher levels of service, as well as I mentioned growing \u2013 putting on more new accounts, and we are getting loans on the new accounts. So I think we are kind of hitting on all cylinders and it\u2019s showing up in loan growth. And we also saw our sales growth accelerate to 6% this quarter which is the best in a number of quarters. Mark DeVries \u2013 Barclays: Okay, great. And just a follow up on the guidance around reward expense margin give you are still at some of the 100 basis points for the year. I think the first half of the year is only been about 95 bps. Should we assume that there is going to be greater promotional activity in the back half of the year, that\u2019s going to bring you closer to 105 for the back half of the year or should we consider this conservative guidance there? Mark Graf : Yeah. I would not interpret it as conservative guidance. I would say I feel really good about that guidance. The area of 1% is the right way to think about it. If anything Mark for the year it may trend up a basis points or two higher than that. So I would say it remains good guidance. David Nelms : But to answer your seasonal question you\u2019ve seen as in year ago, this was a fairly light quarter and then we tended to pick up more moving in to the holidays. And we\u2019d expect to do the same this year. Mark DeVries \u2013 Barclays: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Sanjay Sakhrani. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Thank you. I guess you guys built reserves this quarter, and I was just wondering, as we look out, should we just expect that you guys will continue to build reserves? And maybe just on a related note when we think about the seasoning process from the growth that you\u2019ve booked over the course of last 1.5 years, I mean kind of where are we with that process? I mean when do we start seeing that actually be somewhat of a headwind in the face of kind of stabilization in credit? Thanks. David Nelms : Sanjay I will try and answer this and do them justice here. I would say from a reserving perspective, reserve trajectories still feel like they are being driven by growth. The credit environment, the backdrop itself still feels relatively benign. We don\u2019t see any fundamental churns out there at all. So quarter-over-quarter there might be some variability in that. I think as we said before the gap is pretty prescriptive in terms of how you actually set the reserves. So on a 1.6 billion we may [bill them] 21 and release 20 the next quarter is the way I think about it. We are just sitting flat bumping along the bottom with those kind of relative numbers. In terms of seasoning and where things are going to come out, what I would say is we\u2019ve been generating real strong loan growth now for over three years. And in light of that if you think about the way our card loan seasons you typically tend to see peak charge-offs somewhere between month 18 and month 30. So we are already well into the seasoning process on the first two years, on those vintages of growth, which I think really speaks to the quality of the loans we are attracting, really underscores that we are operating first of all in a benign credit environment but then really with respect to us, I think it really underscores the fact we focus on a prime bar and the quality of that portfolio that we are building. Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Okay, right. I am sorry, one just quick follow-up. Has that the profile of the currency you book changed over the course of the time, I mean have you guys tried to broaden it out a little bit more? David Nelms : I\u2019d say overall the quality is quite consistent. Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is going to come from Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead, your line is open. Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Thanks very much. Just a follow-up on the growth. How should we think about the sequential growth, David just given the trend that you\u2019ve mentioned which is sort of above standard growth for three years in a row. It\u2019s starting to lead to dis-inflating sequentially growth rates. So how should we think about that dynamic? David Nelms : Well, I\u2019m not sure I follow exactly your sequential question. I guess see if you\u2026 Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Sorry, in credit card the sequential growth was about 3.5% versus the 6% year-on-year growth right? David Nelms : Yeah, well obviously the card business is seasonal. So I personally think the better way to do it is to look at it year-over-year which removes that seasonality and we have been operating near that the high-end of the 2% to 5% target for a while now and I guess this is the first quarter that we have actually broken through that and are above that. I wouldn\u2019t promise that we are going to remain above it but I certainly would suggest that we are going to be at least at the high-end here for a while because I don\u2019t see any of the positive trends that we are achieving, reserving in the next quarter or two. Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Thanks. And Mark if I can just ask one quick follow-up question do you happen to know the dollar amount of the tax benefit in the period? Mark Graf : I don\u2019t have it at my fingertips. We can follow-up and get that to you. Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Yeah, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And that our next question is going to come from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open. Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup: David you had made some comments about the loan growth. As we look at some of your competitors, I mean it looks like there is a fairly consistent I guess you could call it an uptick in loan growth but it sounds like maybe you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re not really seeing that or is it more you just want to be cautious because it\u2019s a small uplift, I mean are you seeing any increased demand for credit from customers or is it \u2013 and we understand that you\u2019re definitely gaining market share, just trying you know parse it out a little bit more. David Nelms : Well, I am not exactly sure what you are looking at but from our biggest competitors what I\u2019m seeing is that American express is the only large competitor that\u2019s growing close to our levels and the other largest issuers are sort of plus or minus 2% kind of ranges. So I am not seeing an overall industry pick-up to sort of our levels of growth. So it looks \u2013 the industry as a whole looks pretty flat. I mean maybe the industry has moved from minus 1% to plus 1% or something but it\u2019s still darn near flat and so I am very pleased with our 6% growth with a flat industry. Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup: Got it. And then into July, the spend has that held relatively steady? David Nelms : It has, the last two months of the quarter and then continuing into this month are pretty consistent with that 6% overall quarter year-over-year. So feeling good about seeing a little higher growth sustaining for now. Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup: Got it, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And that our next question is going to come from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open. Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hey, good afternoon guys. Mark when I think about the trajectory of the net interest margin, just thinking back to last year, I think there was an expectation of decline in the first-half and then improvement in back half of the year. So while you\u2019re starting base obviously a lot higher at this point just given the seasonal tailwinds that you sometimes see in 3Q, should we expect to see the margin begin to expand again from its current levels? Mark Graf : Yeah, right. I would say, I would expect flattish is the right way to think about it from where we sit right now for the remainder of the year. I think there are some puts and takes in there. I think from a loan yield standpoint I think flattish is the way to think about that one. I think we have a little bit less funding cost tail wind, if you will in terms of the maturities that are rolling off and little less pick-up on some of this going forward. But I would say we actually would have some margin expansion this quarter just to be transparent with our investor base. I think we had three basis points of sequential contraction that\u2019s because we chose to take some of the goodness we\u2019re seeing right now and use that to position ourselves to perform well when the environment turns and you have a rising rate situation is well. So we consciously did some of that and I would except you might see us do a little bit more of that as the year goes on. So I would stick to the flattish NIM guidance as you look to the year. Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs : And is that driving higher sensitivity to rates, when rates do eventually raise? Mark Graf : Over time, yes it will. Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay. And then Mark just have one unrelated question, on credit you know when I look at the recovery numbers it looks like we are seeing no signs of slowing. I guess relative to your initial guidance from last year are you seeing any changes on recoveries, obviously they are coming in better if they do continue to come better is it safe to say that we could actually see credit improving over the next couple of quarters. Mark Graf : Yeah, I would think about recoveries in two different buckets Ryan. The first bucket is what I\u2019ll call the recoveries on the pool of charge-offs from the recession, right. And as we have said before we have continued to realize that recoveries off that bucket for a much longer period of time then you would following a normal downturn. Usually by the time you\u2019re 24 months past a charge-off your recoveries have really peaked and they tail off pretty quickly thereafter. And we\u2019re five years past that point in time and recoveries are still coming off that book and I would say they\u2019re coming at a \u2013 they\u2019re attriting at a much lower rate than we would have guessed as you pointed out. So overtime clearly that\u2019s a finite book, it will attrite, right. So I would over time it\u2019s happening slower than we expected but that attrition will take place. Then you have to look at the new charge-offs that are flowing into the pipe, if you will to refill that bucket and I think it\u2019s a really good thing that we don\u2019t have many of them today. So the fact that we are just not charging-off a lot gives you limited potential for recoveries against a much smaller book of charged-off accounts. So the recovery rate itself when you pass it up a new charge-offs is very good as it\u2019s ever been, the recovery rate on that static pool from the crisis will attrite overtime. Ryan Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Got it, thanks for taking my questions. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from David Ho of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open. David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. A quick question on expenses, you reiterated the guidance for the year for $3.3 billion of expenses. If I take the first-half run-rate it seems to imply that the second-half will be up about 6% year-over-year. Is that just kind of the timing of marketing and a little more build another expenses and comp? And how much has the mortgage business been right sized, have cost come out of that business as you\u2019ve seen kind of a tick down in revenues there? Mark Graf : Yeah, I would say $3.3 billion still feels like a good number on the full year. There is some definitely some seasonality in the expense base, there is no question about that and there is some back end load. I would say with respect to the mortgage company specifically I feel like we have taken the right actions there at this point in time to position that business. Well it\u2019s still burning a little bit of money but not a real measureable amount to be honest, at least not anything that shows up at the top of the company in a meaningful way and we are continuing to work on positioning the longer term strategy with respect to that business within Discover but I feel like we have taken the action that needed to take there. David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay, thanks. And just following-up on Ryan\u2019s question about asset sensitivity increasing, can you remind us what percentage of the books is variable rate loans and of that how much do you expect to be able to re-price or realize the rate changes in a high rate environment? David Nelms : Yeah, I think there is bunch of moving pieces in there David. What I would say is I think an immediate parallel shock of 100 basis points to rates produces something on the order of $130 million roughly was our last quarterly disclosure. We\u2019ll obviously update in our new Q as well. The vast majority of the loan book is floating. The card book floats at this point in time. Some of the student loans effects and the personal loans as well. So I don\u2019t have the exact rate down at my fingertips but the vast majority of the book is a floating rate book. David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Right. And you think that would probably rise with the deposits being a little more sticky and the assets being re-priced? David Nelms : Yeah. I think the one thing we have talked about and I think we just need to continue being transparent about is if you want to continue driving sales growth at some point in time there probably is a cap on some of your floating loans some of the card, right if you are going to charge 40% for cards you are not going to get a lot of field usage but we\u2019re far, far away from when we think that begins to kick in. David Ho \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Right. Thank you for taking my question. David Nelms : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Bill Carcache from Nomura Securities. Please go ahead your line is open. Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities : Thank you. Good evening. I had a follow up question on expenses, in particular your revenue growth outpaced your operating expenses by over 9% this quarter. I know you guys have an operating efficiency ratio target but I was hoping that you could discuss how you guys are thinking about positive operating leverage as we look at the business beyond this year and into next, is there any kind of a commitment to growing revenues faster than expenses at this point in the cycle or is it really all about the efficiency ratio and expenses overtime will go up or down with revenues? Mark Graf : The way I would think about it is to really look at the fact that we\u2019ve been investing pretty heavily over the course of the last couple of years, take advantage of the goodness in the environment. So part of some of the negative operating leverage you\u2019ve seen over the course of last couple of years has really been driven by that fact. I can assure you that David is laser focused on positive operating leverage and making sure that revenue growth outpaces expense growth over the long run. I think there is quarters where we will, there is quarters where we won\u2019t by virtue of what\u2019s taking place in that given quarter. So I would say we will anchor to that efficiency ratio but we are always striving for positive operating leverage in the business model. Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities : So then just mathematically to the extent that overtime revenues are growing faster than expenses and there could be overtime some potential for that efficiency ratio target to move lower? David Nelms : Yeah, I might comment that we expect some positive operating leverage but probably more modest than what you just cited and I think that one of the things Mark just talked about taking expenses down in for instance home loans and that sort of a one-time event that\u2019s impacting us benefiting us if you will at this time but on the flip side we\u2019ve got higher regulatory related cost and so I think the way to think about it is we\u2019ve established 38% efficiency margin and we expect to roughly maintain that. It could possibly go the other way at some point because if we see great marketing opportunities we might choose to go the other way. So we are not promising positive operating margin or operating leverage whatever but if we get off that track it will be for a good reason and for a limited period of time. Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities : Understood and thank you. If I may on a separate note you guys haven\u2019t had any inverse receivable for the trust in the long time and you\u2019ve talked about this in the past but I think in looking at it I don\u2019t believe that any of your originations from 2009 to 2014 are in there so balance has been gradually decreasing. I\u2019m just hoping maybe you could briefly touch on how you are thinking about the trust and how it fits in the packing order of funding preferences here? Thanks. Mark Graf : Yeah, it\u2019s great cost effective funding for us to issue a card ABS. What I would say is we have a significant excess of receivables in the trust overall we need for the planned issuances at this point in time and that\u2019s why you haven\u2019t seen it contribute any new assets for the trust in extended period of time. So when we get into \u2013 should we get into a situation where we, we would be running up against capacities, we\u2019d obviously be willing to consider putting more receivables in. Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities : Great. Thank you. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is going to come from Moshe Orenbuch out of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead your line is open. Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse : Great. Thanks. I was intrigued David by statement you just made about if you found kind of great marketing opportunities here, you are at a point where you weren\u2019t materially increasing marketing expending you are outgrowing, you are outgrowing the industry, your sales volume growth is accelerating and your cost not certainly well within the range of what you said out. I guess to turn that question around is I mean what, what could you be doing to make it even better, is there anything that could be done here and kind of maybe just if you could talk on just how you assess the credit, the kind of competitive state in your market? Mark Graf : Well I think we have a disciplined approach to thinking about marginal cost and marginal benefit and we look at that across all of our businesses and across of our programs. And so we think that we\u2019re at a pretty optimal point here and, and so at the margin, we think we have diminished, you know payback from incremental investments and, and that we\u2019ve actually been able to focus as much on a fixed efficiency and effectiveness to outgrow the industry, not doing flips in the industry. And I think what you spend in marketing maybe it\u2019s important but what your product is, the service the back seat that rewards program how good you are at direct marketing and of course we focus all of our efforts on direct, we don\u2019t have channel comp liquid branches and all that. Those things are just as important. So we\u2019re constantly evaluating incremental opportunities and killing things that aren\u2019t payback and adding things to do. Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse : Just a follow up if you I mean if you were to do something where it would fall short, would it fall short on terms of the cost to produce it or the credit or the spending performance where you think that would be? David Nelms : You know it\u2019s typically in the cost per new account or cost per incremental marketing effort relative to the loan balances and spending and credit performance that you get. Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse : Good. Thanks very much David. Operator : Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Chris Donat out of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead your line is open. Christopher Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Had one follow up on the word spending just the seasonality what the second quarter this year being lowest so far and as I look back in last three years second quarter has been the lowest quarter as percent of card sales volume. Is that solely a function of the, the quarterly cash back bonus program or is there something else going on in that seasonality? Mark Graf : It\u2019s primarily related to 5% and other promotional programs. And, and... Christopher Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Got it. Mark Graf : And the, single factor is what categories are we promoting and we tend to you saw last year we promoted online thing, and big categories like online and department stores therein times and people are doing their holiday shopping and such and then will typically do things like gas programs during the summer and so on but that still tends to a smaller overall category. Christopher Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Okay, and then just a follow-up on a comment that Mark had made, sort of tacking on in answer to question there, additional spending that you due would be for a limited period of time, like I said think about the run rate you are on for this year at 3.2 so things are looking at just to spend on to get to their $3.3 billion of annual spending or operating expenses. That\u2019s on the variable side right it\u2019s marketing now if you are looking a higher, a whole bunch of new people or anything that would recur immediately in 2015 right? Mark Graf : Yeah. I think you should rightly assume the vast majority of it, the vast majority of it is variable, that\u2019s the right way to think about it. Christopher Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Got it. Thanks Mark. Operator : Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Bob Napoli. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Robert Napoli \u2013 William Blair & Co.: Thank you. Good afternoon. A question on capital, I know you said you are going to buyback the same amount of stock but I was curious why you didn\u2019t buyback you know as much as you look at your capital level, a way to use that capital that can be and I guess the Fed is more comfortable with is some M&A and I just don\u2019t know I mean you guys have been as you\u2019ve mentioned time and \u2013 rewarded investors with discipline and are there opportunities to use that capital in a strategic manner that would add additional growth, long term growth opportunities that you\u2019re comfortable with and are you looking hard, I guess? Mark Graf : Why don\u2019t I start the answer that one and then I\u2019ll pass it over to David for more specifics. First of all why we ended up buying a little bit less this quarter I would say Bob we haven\u2019t got into the habit of talking about when we\u2019re in the market, when we\u2019re out of the market, why or how much. So I prefer not to get selective on that. I\u2019d rather just say we\u2019re going to \u2013 our plan is to take out the $1.6 billion over the course of the four quarter rolling period. I would say with respect to our approach and our appetite for M&A I would just remind you before I pass things to David, our capital prioritization stack, it\u2019s first and foremost organic growth. It\u2019s secondly returning it to shareholders which as you rightly point out under the current CCAR process is somewhat constrained these days. Third, it would be financially attractive portfolio acquisitions. They\u2019ve got to be financially attractive because by definition they are tied to their portfolios, so I would say that would be a piece of the puzzle. And then fourth on that prioritization list would be M&A because you introduce the key man retention risk, the diligence risk the integration risk all those other different pieces of puzzle that the others don\u2019t bring forth. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re pretty disciplined around the way we look at M&A, in terms of what we might be willing to consider David I\u2019ll pass that to you for\u2026 David Nelms : Well I would just reinforce that we\u2019re primarily an organic growth story and the reason for that is there is a. I think a limited set of opportunities that would directly fit with our direct banking and payments partner strategy. Secondly, we have achieved a very strong returns in our business and therefore the hurdles as we think about where to put our incremental shareholder\u2019s capital, we tended to find more opportunities to actually grow organically and build shareholder value in that way. And thirdly, we do \u2013 while we\u2019ve done some M&A overtime we do approach it with a fair bit of skepticism and there is a lot of cases where it has \u2013 M&A has detracted from shareholder value versus building that hand. So we\u2019re going to be very cautious in approaching that. I guess the final thing I\u2019d say is that I do think that the \u2013 we\u2019re playing a long term game here and I think that it\u2019s likely that as regulators and institutions get more comfortable with the new approach and the new levels of capital and the processes in place that some of this sort of constraints may loosen up overtime and so it\u2019s important not to have money burn holes in our pockets because we may be able to return more of it overtime. Robert Napoli \u2013 William Blair & Co.: Great. And just a quick follow up I guess on the credit card business. Have you\u2019ve been adjusting credit lines. One of your competitors has moved to credit line increases and I think we\u2019ve seen some of that in the Fed data. Given the strong credit, is that a way to get growth, have you been doing, adjusting credit lines or anything else on the credit side? David Nelms : Our line increased strategy hasn\u2019t changed material over the last couple of years. Robert Napoli \u2013 William Blair & Co.: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Brian Foran. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research : Hi. Good afternoon guys. I guess on loan yields I kind of asked the same question last quarter and you gave a pretty good decent detailed answer on kind of the broad industry dynamics. But I mean I guess when I look at it I mean you\u2019ve got a banking industry where loan yields are 4% and falling fast. You\u2019ve got you guys where loan yields are 11.4% and not falling at all. I mean is there anything you are seeing on the horizon that would lead to increased competition for those loan yields, it\u2019s just you\u2019re in a remarkably good spot where you\u2019re actually able to grow revenue as you\u2019ve grown loan balances, so obviously the risk is that changes? David Nelms : Well, I think that it\u2019s more a factor of the fact that we focus on direct banking and on more profitable products. And so I think that if you compare our card yield to other card yields we still look attractive for one reason. We don\u2019t charge off as much interest as competitors with higher loan losses but it\u2019s a lot closer. And as we have expanded into other businesses student loans are \u2013 is a lower yields than other unsecured loan types but it\u2019s still above secured loan types such as mortgages. Personal loan also tends to be below card but still it\u2019s a lot closer to card than other banking products. So one of the direct banking strategy has a lot of benefits picking and choosing which products you offer and which you don\u2019t is one of those and we have been judicious in that. I guess the final thing I\u2019d say is where else we have been disciplined. We\u2019re disciplined on our use of promotional rates. We\u2019re disciplined on focusing on revolvers and if you have lot of transactors in your book you tend to suppress the yield because you have zero earning assets in there and we\u2019ve been judicious on credit because writing [enough] interest also deducts from that yield. Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research : As an unrelated follow-up there is a lot changes going on in private label card and can you just remind us how you think about that business long-term as something that potential part of the roster, so to speak? David Nelms : I think we\u2019ve said overtime that, that could fit the strategy if we ever found an appropriate entry path but the entry paths are very limited and we have not seen any to-date. So I would think about that as opportunistic. Could it happen someday, yes but it may never happen and it\u2019s not a critical product in the way that direct check-in or even some of our mortgage products are to thinking about being a leader in direct banking. It\u2019s more of a nice to have if an opportunity ever happens, but private label has had a rebound of late but still if you look at the long term it\u2019s not necessarily growing relative to general purpose cards and it\u2019s a more limited market sized in general purpose cards and so I think there is only room for a more limited set of competitors to offer that kind of product. Brian Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Craig Maurer out of CLSA. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Craig Maurer \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities : Yeah, good evening. Thanks. At the Investor Day, you had talked about looking to significantly enhance your portfolio of spend centric products to try to leverage your network and I was just wondering where you stand in that thought process? Thanks. David Nelms : I actually don\u2019t remember that comment. I think we certainly have talked about continuing to enhance and differentiate our core card products and I feel very good about Discover It which is our flagship product, the free FICA scores have been very well received by consumers and not widely copied by competitors. In fact I think we\u2019re still the only one to offer it on the statements. We\u2019ve added some security features that are somewhat unique in the industry as an example. We\u2019ve put in the ability for consumers to turn their card on or off with a flick of a button online if for instance they misplaced their card which I am not familiar with other competitors having that. We\u2019ve continue to enhance the rewards program as well. So we\u2019ve, I think what you heard at the Investor Day was us talking about our focus on good credit quality revolvers and that one of the things that differentiates us is it seems like a number of our competitors are really chasing transactors that look good in today\u2019s rate environment but is not typically driving revenue and that\u2019s one of the reasons you\u2019ve seen in our revenue go up and other card companies go down in revenue because the transactors simply don\u2019t produce as much revenue. Craig Maurer \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from David Hochstim out of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research : Yeah, thanks. I wondered, David can you give us a sense of the mix of the contributors for loan growth, you mentioned new customers and existing customers and have you done anything with, is there any change in teaser rates and promotional rates this quarter? David Nelms : I would say our loan growth continues to be quite balanced. We are getting loan growth from new customers. We are also retaining customers and getting higher level of activation and engagement out of existing customers. So we have not done anything dramatically differentially in teaser rates. One way you can see that if you haven\u2019t seen a big change in yield. And so pricing has held up even as growth has held up and even accelerated a bit. So we are constantly testing, adjusting by retaining a very disciplined and balanced loan growth and we have not \u2013 in our opinion the quick change your credit or change your pricing could drive a spurt of growth but is not \u2013 is easier to execute but the executing a differentiated strategy with all of our customer service, onshore, inside that company better service levels that drive better retention of balances is the way to get both good credit results, good yield and loan growth overtime which ultimately leads to profits. David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research : Okay. And then Mark is there, are any tax benefits coming in the second-half and what\u2019s good estimate for the effective tax rate in the second-half? Mark Graf : I would use 37.5% as a good estimate for the effective tax rate in the second-half. We always have as any large company does open matters before various taxing authorities and so the possibility always exists but I am not banking on any, how about that. David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Jason Arnold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jason Arnold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Hi, good evening guys. I was just curious if you could comment a little further on the competitive side. Are you seeing any competitors doing anything for more aggressive rather or ordinary versus prior periods at all? David Nelms : I would say that different players are coming in and out in terms of aggressiveness. The general trend in recent years is \u2013 there has been huge shift towards everyone focusing on rewards and in particular cash reward but that\u2019s partly because it\u2019s working, consumers love it. They\u2019ve seen competitors see our success and want to get some of that if you will. But that\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not a new trend. What we have seen is this year you know there\u2019s one or two competitors that have picked-up their marketing intensity and there is one or two players that have actually reduced their marketing intensity on cash kind of rewards. It is expensive to offer, it is what we focus on and we focusing on delivering great value at affordable cost of the company which allows us to sustain it over the long-term. And I think one of the things I\u2019m really proud of is how well our top-line advertising is working. Our consumer testing shows that we are getting some of the best results in years and our marketing campaigns are more effective for a given level of spend then our competitors so our commercials and sponsorships like the NHL are working harder for us and that is really helping. Jason Arnold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Great. Good to hear that. And just one another unrelated item I know we are still somewhat early on but can you give us an update on the cash back checking product and how things are going there? David Nelms : Sure I mentioned you know we launched cash back checking last year in a limited cross-sell and what we told everyone at the Investor Day is that we really wanted to get our core banking system in place before we started to really scale that. I mention that we put that in successfully during Memorial Day so we really feel good that it\u2019s going in well and so we are just about a point that it will start ramping up but will be ramping up in a cross-sell manner. We \u2013 there is a new system has allowed us some new capabilities to make it easier to offer to most of our current base and obviously with a large customer base that represents about a quarter of U.S. household that will be the place that cross sell will be the most cost effective to expand it from this point. We have not yet made a decision as to when we are going to launch beyond our current customer base. It\u2019s entirely possible that the rest of this year we are going to focus on and expand cross sell and it maybe next year before we go broad market but stay tuned for that. Jason Arnold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Terrific, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And that our next question is going to come from Vincent Caintic out of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Vincent Caintic \u2013 Macquarie: Hi, good evening. On the gross interchange rate, I\u2019m calculating a 200 basis points rate for this quarter which is higher than it\u2019s been at least since 2011 and despite the lower rewards expenses. I was wondering if there is any one-time or kind of second quarter items there that we shouldn\u2019t think about as a run-rate or this is a kind of good jump start for the rest of the year. David Nelms : Yes, I would say there is a couple of different things taking place there. First of all as we did a re-class of certain merchant fees in the first quarter so a part of is being is reflective of that re-class that was done. The second piece of the puzzle I would say is just the spend mix over the course of the quarter and the spending tilted more toward merchants with higher discount rates this quarter and a way for merchants who have lower discount rates. So, I would say that tends to move back and forth quarter year-over-year. It feels like MDR is in a decent range at this point in time. Vincent Caintic \u2013 Macquarie: Got it, it makes sense. And follow-up actually on the lowering yield questions that were asked previously and I will take it through another track. You mentioned with the card loan yield to start the lower interest charge-offs were a meaningful benefit to that. So, if you kind of a normalize with the credit being taken out of the equation, do yield point towards a downward structure or how should we think about that? Thanks. David Nelms : Yes, all right. I was just going to say if you take credit out of the equation yield feels pretty stable. Just look at the ALM positioning we have had for the company we positioned ourselves to absorb the initial phases of rate shocks to our funding cost base. We continue as I mentioned in my commentary in the margin we continue to push out our funding, extending maturities fixing rates positioning ourselves for that so the funding cost component a yield feels pretty good. The actual card yield itself feels pretty good the actual asset yield themselves feel pretty good the stated yield on the product. So it\u2019s really just the interest charge-offs that are the other piece of variability. I would say if you exclude them, feel very stable. Mark Graf : And remember that\u2019s stable in the shorter-term, we still think over the longer-term we would expect credit to normalize somewhat and then that would push the yields down closer to the levels that we have talked about in the past. David Nelms : But that would come through the charge-off line as opposed to the stated yield in the asset or the funding. Vincent Caintic \u2013 Macquarie: Got it, thanks very much guys. David Nelms : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And that our next question is going to come from Sameer Gokhale out of Janney Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital : Hi, thanks. You know a couple of questions I guess my first one was, you mentioned one of the competitor who is growing faster than the market or at a decent clip and of course you are growing a pretty good clip in the card business and it looks like most of the larger card issuers really aren\u2019t seeing that much growth on the year-over-year basis. There is a one company Wells Fargo which is actually growing faster than even you are and of course they have a much smaller loan portfolio. So what I am curious in getting your thoughts on is they\u2019re growing faster than the industry, faster than you are smaller portfolio but I was wondering how we should think about the competitive landscape as they continue to grow. They seem to be taking more share away from your competitors but at some point I have to believe there is a trickle-down effect to the extend your competitors are forced to spend more marketing to defend share then you have to spend more. So how should we think about that? Are you in such a different target market that really doesn\u2019t affect you? Just your thoughts will be helpful? David Nelms : Yes, I think that we\u2019ve typically referred to the big six because that includes us because there has been such a big gap between the six of us and the next one. We have increasingly started tracking Wells Fargo to a much greater degree. They are growing faster by rate from a smaller base. And I would expect that to continue. And I think over time we may get to a point where we talk about the big seven as opposed to the big six. That being said, it\u2019s branch-driven. I think it\u2019s probably a wider credit box than we have, they are not national. So we are not bumping up against them in national Internet and direct mail campaigns to as much degree. We are not bumping in with them with national advertising the way we are with really most of the big six. But still they will, as they take share of the total market they will become more of a player. So I expect that it\u2019s likely to may be impact the other branch banks more because they are following that strategy. But it will also have some competitive impact on us. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital : Okay. That\u2019s a very complete and helpful answer. Thank you. And then the other question I had was you answered the question about industry competition and growth in several different ways. And I was wondering if you think that loan growth for the card industry will ever get to 5% plus level? I mean clearly you are there. But you haven\u2019t raised your target range. But it seems like unless there is a significant pick up in personal incomes or something that makes consumers more optimistic about borrowing more and lenders more willing to lend, I just can\u2019t see that dynamic ever changing with industry growth overall exceeding 5%. So I mean is that consistent with your view or do you feel that at some point we really could see the industry growth overall accelerate? And what would drive that? David Nelms : Well, I think we could see some acceleration from the really non growth today that we are seeing. I continue to believe that it will accelerate to be roughly in line with GDP. And so low double-digits, may be not 5%. Even a couple of percent growth would be a meaningful change from where this industry has been. And I think what\u2019s driving that is, I think the de-leveraging is largely complete with consumers and competitive changes in the market place. And then I would expect credit card to grow more with the economy with incomes, with retail sales. And I don\u2019t see \u2013 if you look at the times when the industry grew really fast historically it was when balance transfer was introduced or when credit was standard for reduced. And I don\u2019t see either of those trends happening to have a fundamental change going forward. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital : Okay. Then it sounds like we\u2019re on the same page. So appreciate your perspective. Thank you. Operator : Great. Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. David Nelms : All right. Thank you everyone. As a reminder the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any additional questions. Have a good night. Mark Graf : Thank you all. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Adrian and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions). I'll now turn call over to Bill Franklin. Bill Franklin, you may begin. Bill Franklin : Thank you, Adrian. Good afternoon everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin as always with slide 2 of our earnings presentation which is on the investor relations section of discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release which was furnished to the SEC today in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs which are on our website and on file with the SEC. In the third quarter 2014 earnings materials we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Our call this afternoon will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question and answer session. During the Q&A period it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated. So now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David. David Nelms : I want to thank all of you for joining us on the call today. After the market closed, we reported third quarter net income of 644 million and earnings per share of $1.37, up 14% over the prior year driven primarily by profitable loan growth and share repurchases with a return on equity of 23%. Our Direct Banking business continues to deliver solid results. On slide 4 of the earnings presentation you'll see Discover achieved total loan growth of 7% over the prior year. This was driven by strong growth in card, personal loans and private student loans. Card receivables grew 6.6% this quarter, which is a rate that continues to outpace our peers and indicates that we are continuing to take share. We\u2019re driving this growth by adding new accounts and increasing wallet share with existing customers. The overall value proposition of Discover it continues to resonate with customers as we achieved a double digit new account growth rate again in the third quarter. We believe that the increase in wallet share and our continued low attrition both of which benefit card loan growth are held by our award recognized customer satisfaction. In the quarter, Discover tied for highest in customer satisfaction with credit card companies for 2014 according to J.D. Power. This is a first for Discover and demonstrates our continued focus on the customer is being recognized in the market place. Discover received the highest rating in the area of customer interaction which focuses on how card members perceive the service received through key engagement channels, such as website, call centers, automated phone system, online chat, e-mail and mobile phone. Our continued enhancement of mobile and digital technology includes developments that allow users to view account information more conveniently for ease in activate cards with a single touch and our recent release of an app that makes us first credit card company or major bank that lets card members log into their accounts using fingerprint authorization. These are just a few of the ways we continue to deploy innovative functionality for consumers. Discover also ranked highly in the categories of credit card terms, benefits and services, problem resolution and rewards. Along these lines later in our call, Mark will give you some insight into how we\u2019re thinking about further improving ease of rewards redemption for card members. Card sales for the quarter increased 5.8% from the prior year. More active accounts year-over-year driven by new accounts, higher average spend per active, reactivating existing accounts and very low attrition, all contributed to growth beyond U.S. retail sales. Our second largest asset class, private student loans grew 5% and when you look at the organic growth, excluding the acquired portfolios we were able to achieve 23% growth year-over-year. June, July and August are peak season for student loan applications. During peak season, we experienced strong application growth of 11% over the prior year. Although we were challenged a bit in the graduate student loan market due to previous price decreases on federal graduate student loans. This was more than offset by the gains we made in undergraduate originations. The increase in undergraduate originations was mostly the result of our increased marketing, our in-school repayment product and the 1% rewards feature we added for good grade on new student loans. Moving to our payment segment, volume increased by 2%. We shared earlier this year that we will be losing some third party volumes in network partners and at PULSE. For example, the Synchrony issued Sam's-Walmart card volume began running off this quarter as it transitioned to another network and we expect the majority of this volume to leave network partners results in the fourth quarter. That said, I believe that the value that Discover Network to our card issuing business has never been greater in terms of acceptance, brand awareness and economics. We mentioned at our financial community briefing earlier this year that we would be competing for all debit. This quarter The American Bankers Association announced their endorsement of Discover Debit. Historically banks had only two options for their signature debit cards. We want to give them another option. We believe our Discover Debit product can offer superior economics, simplified rules, fee transparency and similar acceptance. Another item we discussed at our financial community briefing when we covered our key priorities was risk management. The regulatory environment continues to be challenging and we like others in the industry are dedicating significant internal focus to regulatory and compliance initiatives. Before I turn the call over to Mark through the details of third quarter performance, let me say that I'm proud of our operating results, great credit performance and our ability to continue to drive solid prime loan growth. Mark? Mark Graf : Thanks David. I will begin my comments today by going through the revenue detail on slide 5 of our presentation. Net interest income increased $129 million or 9% over the prior year due to continued loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total non-interest income was relatively flat at $552 million as several puts and takes within various line items essentially offset each other. Specifically, net discount and interchange revenue increased by $19 million or 7% year-over-year driven by higher Discover Card sales volume. Protection product revenue continues to decline down $12 million year-over-year given our suspension of protection product sales in late 2012. Partially offsetting this, loan fee income was up $7 million. Other revenue decreased $15 million mostly due to a prior reclassification of some merchant fees now recognized in discount and interchange revenue as well as lower mortgage related income. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 103 basis points which was 5 basis points higher than last year due to an increase in standard rewards driven in part by higher Discover it sales. Relative to the prior period, the rewards rate was up 12 basis points a result of more 5% cash back bonus activity as the third quarter category was gasoline as well as lower forfeitures. Following up on David's earlier comment I want to share some of our latest thinking on the rewards program and some potential impacts to the P&L in the fourth quarter and beyond. We've said for some time that we are focused on maintaining our strong position in a very competitive rewards environment. And as I\u2019ve mentioned at a recent conference, we're currently revisiting our rewards program with a goal of delivering greater ease of redemption and eliminating most or all forfeiture triggers. To that end we are contemplating a series of changes to the redemption elements of our rewards program. While not yet finalized we estimate these changes could result in a onetime charge of up to 185 million in the fourth quarter due to the extinguishment of all or part of our current reserve for rewards forfeiture. The ongoing run-rate impact of these contemplated changes should be very manageable, somewhere less than five basis points per annum. Continuing on slide 5, Payment Services revenue for the quarter was down slightly relative to the prior year, but overall we grew total company revenues by 6% for the quarter, driven by strong Direct Banking segment performance. Turning to slide 6, total loan yield of 11.36% was up 7 basis points over the prior year driven by higher card and private student loan yields. The modest year-over-year increase in card yield reflects a higher portion of balances coming from revolving customers and slightly lower interest charge-offs. The year-over-year increase in private student loan yield relates to the PCI accounting favorability we began recognizing in the fourth quarter of 2013 which I discussed in more depth on last quarter's call. Overall, higher total loan yield combined with lower funding costs resulted in a 14 basis point increase in net interest margin over the prior year to 9.78%. Sequentially, net interest margin was down as card members took advantage of promotional offers which benefited loan growth. Additionally we capitalized on the funding environment and issued two longer term deals in the quarter, $1.2 billion a five year fixed rate ABS and $750 million of seven year fixed rate senior bank notes. These deals suppressed some of the funding cost improvement we would have delivered had we done shorter term floating rate issuances. However these longer term fixed rate deals are part of our funding strategy to extend duration at attractive pricing in order to position ourselves for a higher rate environment in the future. Looking forward, we expect modest sequential pressure as we continue to extend the duration of our funding and card yield continues to come down modestly. Turning to slide 7, total operating expense increased by $44 million or 6% over the prior year. The most significant driver of the increase was increased compensation and benefits associated with higher head count to support organizational growth and compliance initiatives. We also invested in more marketing this year particularly in card and personal loans. In addition we continue to enhance our technology which contributed to higher professional fees year-over-year, partially offsetting these increases other expense was down due in part to several onetime items that in aggregate were worth about a penny of EPS. For the quarter, our total company efficiency ratio was 37.8%. As we look forward, the expense base will have a modest upward bias based on a number of factors including additional marketing spend, regulatory and compliance staffing and technology enhancements. All in, we expect our 2015 efficiency ratio to be modestly above our 38% long term efficiency target. Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on slide 8, provision for loan losses was higher by $21 million compared to the prior year. The primary contributor was a $33 million increase in net charge-offs driven by loan growth and lower dollar recoveries. I would remind you the recovery dollars are declining as the available inventory from previously charged-off loans diminishes and isn't refilling as quickly with new charged-off balances. Partially offsetting higher net charge-offs was a $12 million lower reserve build compared to the prior year but reserves were up sequentially. The credit card net charge-off rate was 2.16% up 11 basis points year-over-year and down 17 basis points sequentially. The 30 plus day delinquency rate was 1.71%, four basis points higher versus the prior year and up sequentially by eight basis points. The private student loan net charge-off rate excluding purchase credit impaired loans was down 16 basis points sequentially to 1.14% due to seasonality related to lower charge-offs and higher disbursements in the third quarter. The 30 plus day delinquency rate increased by 12 basis points to 1.78% as the organic book continues to come into repayment. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in-lines with our expectations. Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was down three basis points sequentially to 1.92% and the over 30 day delinquency rate was up nine basis points to 75 basis points. Across all of our portfolios we remain pleased with our strong credit results. However, we do believe our loan growth over the last several years places us on a reserve build trajectory. One last item I would call out on the income statement is that during the quarter we were able to recognize certain prior year tax benefits which reduced our effective tax rate to 36.2% for the quarter. Next I will touch on our capital position on slide 9. You'll note that in addition to our traditional Basel I view we've added a new ratio, an estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio. This new line item assumes fully phased in Basel III requirements and stands at 14.7%, roughly in-lines with our Basel I Tier 1 common ratio of 14.8%. During the quarter we repurchased 622 million of stock, an accelerated pace from the second quarter as we made up for lower buy backs in the prior period. One of our top priorities is to drive shareholder value through effective capital management. To that end we still plan to repurchase a total of $1.06 billion of common stock for the four quarter period ending March 31, 2015 the same amount as our CCAR capital action submitted to the Fed. Also on slide 9 is our outlook for the remainder of 2014. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect NIM to be down slightly as we continue to extend funding duration in this low rate environment and also look to continue to drive card loan growth. With respect to rewards, the fourth quarter will reflect a broad 5% category for holiday shopping. However we still believe the full year will be consistent with our comments last quarter likely coming in a couple basis points north of 1% excluding any potential redemption changes. That concludes our formal remarks. So now I will turn the call back to our operator, Adrian to begin the Q&A session. Operator : (Operator Instructions). And we have Mark DeVries from Barclays on line with a question. Please go ahead. Mark DeVries - Barclays: I want to ask about kind of competitive intensity around card rewards. I appreciate you get this question in different forms almost every quarter. The reason I'm asking is we're starting to see some offers that just cause you to scratch your head on how the economics work for the issuer. Without naming anyone in particular, I'll just reference the double cash rewards offer where you've got effectively 2% back from an issuer that's basically only collecting probably 2% of discount rate. The question David is how much longer do you think we can see offers like this? In your experience when an issuer tends to over shoot with an offer that seems overly aggressive, how quickly can you see a response of them kind of dialing that back? David Nelms : Well I actually think that there has been more stability and competitive intensity than one might think. This has been an intense -- specifically rewards and cash back has been intensely competitive for many years and this is not the first time that we've seen issuers come out with what might look to some of us to be unsustainable. My experience is they don't dial them back real quickly but after two or three years they start seeing the profit numbers not hitting hurdles and then they'll dial them back. I would also say and in fact in recent quarters we've seen some issuers actually dial back earlier rich programs. So that's been a history in the industry. The other thing I'd say is that I wouldn't over focus on one measure. Clearly rewards are very important but service, features \u2013 there is a lot of other things that are very important to customers. And so you don't have -- if people don't have the full package like Discover it, we think it's got a great rewards but a lot of other things. The full package still continues to be more resilient than just having one headline number that you're competing with. Operator : And our next question comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs : Mark on your comment about the modestly above 38% on the efficiency ratio can you just maybe give us a little bit more context, help us understand what assumptions are going into that? What are we assuming for interest rates? What type of loan growth? How do we think about trajectory of the expense base that got you to that above 38%? Mark Graf : Yes there is a bunch in that Ryan and I will try and tackle the ones that really hit the 38% number specifically. I would say there is a couple different things. First of all is we'll be looking at a couple of onetime expenses coming at us next year such as roll-out of EMV, and then I think we're also facing a number of expenses that the entire industry is facing that David eluded to, really additional compliance and regulatory functions and meeting significantly higher expectations obviously is going to be driving some of that as well. We do continue to invest in our technology infrastructure with a principal focus around digital but it's broad based investing that's taking place as well. So those would be the really key drivers of the elements that I see taking our expenses higher as I look into next year. Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs : And then you noted in the release that continued growth would drive reserve actions I guess. Should we expect to see a change in the pace in which you're adding to reserves then? Is it fair to assume that you\u2019re starting to see some higher credit losses in the more recent vintages that is driving this comment or is it just that it's a function of growth? David Nelms : I think Ryan it's really a function of growth. I think the key thing to bear in mind is the vintages are generally seasoning in line with our expectations. But I would also point out that we're coming into the period of time now or if you think about peak losses occurring on a card book somewhere generally between 18 months and 30 months after origination of a vintage. We've got several larger vintages as a result of the growth we've come up over the course of the last couple years coming into the seasoning mode. So continuing again generally to season in-line with our expectations but as the larger vintages come through it will have a modestly larger impact on the overall totals. Operator : And your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW: I've got a couple questions, just back to the efficiency ratio guidance, I was just wondering how much flexibility there might be to the extent that other metrics don't go as planned? I mean how much discretion do you have over some of the expenses that you mentioned or other expenses in case the provision goes up more than you expect it to? And then secondly just David in terms of the above industry average growth that you're seeing, how long do you think that persists given the current competitive environment? Thank you. Mark Graf : So Sanjay I'll tackle expense one and then I'll pass things over to David. I would say there is definitely expense leverage in the model that we can avail ourselves of if we feel we need to go down that path. What I would say is we're continuing to drive very strong growth at this point in time and feel good that our ability in the near term to keep doing that. So it doesn't feel like the time you would want to be pulling back on those levers, all right. So that's why I think we're kind of indicating we expect to see some increased expenses next year because we're choosing to keep those engines running to keep that production coming online at this point in time. David? David Nelms : And Sanjay on the growth, I think we're very pleased that again we performed well above the targeted range that we had laid out a few years back. And I think one of the things that's happening -- well two things are happening. One is we're seeing good results from Discover it, the new features, free FICO, security things that we're putting in place, our advertising and I think we're starting to get an industry that is maybe showing a little more signs of modest growth. We've been growing despite a shrinking industry. And so I think that if the industry itself picks up a little bit then that obviously would be helpful for our ability to continue to grow as robustly as we are as we have been the last two quarters certainly. So probably early next year we'll be actually revisiting and trying to make a decision do we stick with that original guidance that we gave a few years back or do we change it and the industry and our results will be informative in that decision. Operator : And our next question comes from Bill Carcache from Nomura Securities. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities : Mark, I had a question on the calculus of growth driven reserve building. So let's say that we remain in an environment where A, there is no evidence of credit deterioration and B, you continue to grow loans. If we hold everything else constant to isolate the impact, how do you think about the interplay between the tailwind that you get from the additional interest income that you generate on your loan growth and the headwind from higher provision expense associated with the need to build reserves on a growing book? Just factually speaking, what's the math of netting those pieces together in terms of the impact on EPS growth? Mark Graf : That's a really big question that can have an awful lot of calculus impacting both ends of that equation, so how about if I just tell you about the pieces of the puzzle that go into each of them? Because we don't provide EPS guidance, I will stay away from the specific correlation between the two. I guess what I would say is that provisioning itself as I said earlier and as you noted in your question it's really going to be dictated going forward by loan growth. The seasoning of the new vintages, some of the vintages that are coming through are slightly larger than some of the vintages that we've seen before. So that will -- again they're seasoning generally in-line with our expectations but the vintages themselves are slightly larger. The other things that go into the calculus on that side of the equation really are going to be recoveries, right? What is the trajectory at which we continue to realize recoveries off that declining pool but nevertheless still out there of crisis period charge-offs? I would say the economic environment comes into it, bankruptcy filings come into it. So I think there is a lot of different things. I think our comments are really kind of directed at helping you kind of get the fact that the larger vintages are starting to mature. So we do believe that growth will drive incremental provisioning expense, but again I would underscore we don't see any fundamental changes in the economic environment at this point in time. On the net interest income side, again a lot of things taking place there because it depends on the components of growth, right? Are you bringing in lower priced tiers of new accounts? Higher priced tiers of new accounts? Is there a level of promotional activity taking place? What are you doing with your funding costs, both in terms of the market rate environment as well as what levers are that we're pulling right now to fix costs and extend duration on our funding, right? As I said in my prepared comments we're purposely taking our funding costs slightly higher so that we perform better in a rising rate environment locking those in for long periods of time for tranches of the funding. So there is a whole bunch of pieces of the puzzle that go into that that aren't necessarily inter-related but those are the basic levers. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities : Okay and on a related note regarding your reserving methodology. Let\u2019s say that you\u2019re 100% correct in estimating your allowance today, does that mean that the sum of your net charge-offs for the 12 months would total your current period allowance? Mark Graf : It would be forward looking. I am trying to process the question. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities : Yes I mean I guess if it's different, so I mean I guess to the extent that the sum of your charge-offs over the next 12 months is the driver of what your reserve is and you could have -- and you\u2019re 100% correct in estimating what those next 12 month charge-offs are going to be is that what your reserve is today? Or if it's different then why would it be different? Mark Graf : Generally speaking yes, there is a couple little puts and takes around the edges but for the sake of simplistic answer to the question, yes that would be correct. David Nelms : And we reserve for interest charge-offs as well Bill, unless some of our competitors don\u2019t have it going through that allowance line. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities : Okay. So then the related part of that -- then as if we look historically at that relationship between what your actual next 12 month charge-offs have been and your allowance any differences between the two would essentially be attribute to kind of like misestimation because intend all along would be to set the allowance equal to what you expect that next 12 months charge-offs to be? David Nelms : I would say the mathematical answer to that question is yes. I would also point out to you though that in the history of mankind other than playing dumb luck I don\u2019t think anybody has ever nailed their reserve. Operator : And our next question comes from Jason Arnold from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets : A couple of my questions already got taken but just wondering if you can comment on your thoughts on Apple Pay and any other mobile payment initiatives you are undertaking? Thanks. David Nelms : Well I would say that we're excited about that potential prospect of mobile payments generally. I think that it's likely mobile payments are likely to -- well we've been hoping they took off faster. It always seemed to take a little longer than you would like but I think mobile payments has their prospect to have more going into our cards as opposed to cash and check to add more features and functionality to consumers and their purchasing which I think is good for customers and good for our industry. So just generically we're excited about the various mobile efforts in the industry and there is obviously a number of them going on right now. Operator : And our next question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Please go ahead. Bob Napoli - William Blair : I guess maybe a follow-up on that question if you could. Do you expect to be in the Apple Pay? How successful do you think the Apple Pay product will be and what differentiates it from other things that are out there? Was Discover's relationship with PayPal a reason why Discover is not initially in Apple Pay and how is your relationship with -- what are your expectations for that relationship with PayPal now that they're spinning off? David Nelms : Well look I wouldn't want to talk specifically about any of our relationships. We have a lot of important relationships and one of our strategies is to be a great partner to a bunch of people. And I would say that we certainly do expect to be participating in Apple Pay. We don't know when that will be, but we'll be actively working to be included over time. Bob Napoli - William Blair : Okay. Then let me just ask about your consumer loan business I guess. The growth rate there is still continues to be very strong but it has slowed down a little bit. The yield has come in a little bit on that product. Are you seeing more competition? And if so are you seeing any competition from peer-to-peer? Or is it from other banks that are looking at that market as being very attractive? And do you think you can continue to grow that business at rates somewhere near where you have been recently? Mark Graf : Yes, Bob, it's Mark. I will start with that and then pass to David with respect to the yield question on the personal loan business. It's come down slightly as more of the recent vintages really are coming in with shorter durations at origination than they had historically. Remember these are fixed rate products so as they are on a shorter duration the yields are going to be a little bit lower. So you get lower yields but you also from an asset liability management perspective as we look forward to a rising rate environment there is benefit to that fixed rate product being shortened up a bit as well. And respect to the performance to business I will pass to David for that part. David Nelms : I would say there is certainly more competition in that business than there was but I would say that we\u2019re also participating a little more broadly than we were. We mentioned at our Investor Day that we previously did not even consider people that responded -- we had to give an invitation to apply to even be considered for Discover personal loan and we have started testing into unsolicited applications although we still are very much -- we have very strict credit criteria to manage the credit well. So I think that percentage growth rates in that business may decline a little bit but the dollars I think have continued -- of growth have continued to be very strong, that business is now much larger than it was for us a few years ago. So we\u2019re growing off of a lower base, but we're still you know -- our business is growing north of 20% a year. I'm very happy with the growth rates while managing the credit and the yield. Bob Napoli - William Blair : Who is the competition? Are you seeing incremental competition there? David Nelms : Well you mention the P-to-P. They started P-to-P, I don't think they really are anymore but there are some very fast growing and very aggressive kind of non-traditional bank players and some of the more traditional banks are also perking up a bit in this space. But generally you know I think the last two or three years we think we have been the number one originator of personal loans in the country and we continue to be a very -- it continues to be a very good business for us. Operator : And our next question comes from Donald Fandetti from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup: David, I just want to ask broadly on the consumer. I just wanted to clarify, are you seeing any type pickup in appetite for consumer credit? And if so are you noticing any differential between up and down the credit spectrum and you know are there any -- we have seen a lot of the health, at least on the spend side it's been the affluent and trying to get a sense if you are seeing a broadening out or just a general update? David Nelms : As I\u2019ve mentioned before I\u2019ve seen a little bit of a pickup in industry loans and I don't think I am seeing anything real dramatic but I would say the more middle class consumer is typically more likely to revolve some or all of their products and I think what we're seeing is a little bit more confidence by the consumer to revolve some of their debt. And so I think that's leading to a percent or two faster growth rate for the industry. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup: Okay, and then Mark on capital I was just curious if you think you will ultimately need some more preferred as you get into 2016. I know that\u2019s further out, but just want to get an update given what we saw at American Express. Mark Graf : Yes we did issue about 575 million back in late 2012 because we only had common equity in our capital structure any significant degree. We didn't include a preferred issuance in our 2014 CCAR and we are still in the planning phases at this point in time obviously for the 2015 CCAR. So I can't comment on it specifically at this point in time although I would just begin reiterate what we've said before and that is our goal in that CCAR process is to have a prudently aggressive ask, because we fully recognize that our shareholders would like some more capital returns. Operator : And our next question comes from David Ho from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Ho - Deutsche Bank : We talked a lot about competition and the rewards space particularly in the prime revolvers. How quickly does that extend into pricing and then subsequently terms and conditions? David Nelms : Are you talking David, about APR competition? David Ho - Deutsche Bank : Right for spreads and just underlying maybe folks moving down the credit spectrum a little more. David Nelms : Well I would say I've seen a fair amount of stability in both pricing and credit aggressiveness. I'm not seeing with very rare exceptions, I'm not seeing people get back into subprime credit cards and I think that the pricing has been pretty stable for the industry in part because people you know (indiscernible) people know that the price they have to set they have to live with for potentially 10 - 20 years and so I think people are being careful to have an adequate spread. I would also say there has been some consolidation of the industry and the people that are left are probably not going to underprice and I think historically there were some that underpriced and then came back with price increases afterwards. David Ho - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And just a follow-up on the higher efficiency ratio target for 2015, how much of that would be a build and marketing spend? It wasn't really mentioned. Kind of where are the different areas that you will be investing in marketing? Will it be broad based, the launch of checking maybe some new products and how sticky are these compliance and regulatory costs as maybe the new run-rate going forward? David Nelms : Yes, I would say we aren't prepared yet to quite break down the components of that growth for next year. I think we just kind of put them into those broad categories and aren't going to attribute them yet. But I guess without reference to specific numbers what I would say is I think we continue to see great new account acquisition numbers and good loan growth, so I think some continued investment in the marketing space, additional investment in the marketing space is clearly going to make sense both in the card space as well as for certain other products. The regulatory expenses David, I would tell you bluntly, are sticky, all right? I mean I think there is a new higher level of expectation to which the whole industry is being held. I don't think this is unique to us in terms of what you're hearing on this front. It's really across the industry that there are much, much higher regulation and compliance expectations and those drive costs. So I would say those are going to be sticky costs going forward. Operator : And your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Police go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : I mean there is a lot of talk about more competitive environment and marketing spending and alike, can you just talk about the trajectory of costs to put accounts on the books because I mean that\u2019s been a key competitive advantage of yours in terms of your account acquisition cost. David Nelms : Moshe, I would say that's been relatively stable for us. I think that we've continued to move more and more to online verses the traditional direct mail and if you do that well that can be a cost savings. I also think that we have invested very heavily in having a differentiated product that appeals more to consumers, has a better pull rate. So we're continuing to basically make our product more and more appealing so that it's not just pricing as I mentioned before. It's service, it's brand perceptions, it's a lot of work to create more differentiation and that is helping us to I think sustain an average cost per account that you know might otherwise be under pressure if we didn't do any of those things and just watched the competition come back into the market. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : And just as a kind of follow-up, you know the change that you're making in terms of the rewards, forfeiture rewards, should we think about that cost as somewhat additive as we go -- as we think about the level of rewards expense or is that kind of baked into the numbers that you talked about? Mark Graf : There is two component pieces there. The 185 million is a onetime charge to basically extinguish the reserve that's set up on the balance sheet now that's been built-up over a number of years. The five basis point run-rate expense, yes I think you should think that as a marginal increase in the rewards cost. It probably won't be quite that high. I think I said it will be up to five basis points or somewhat less than five basis points I think is exactly what I said. Depending upon component parts and pieces we choose so it's going to be very manageable. Operator : And your next question comes from Matthew Howlett from UBS. Please go ahead. Matthew Howlett - UBS: Just on I guess oil prices if they continue to tread lower or stay down here does that have impact on spend volume? And then I guess no one has touched on the private [ph] student lending that appears to be flattish, just didn't know what was going over there and then maybe if you could just comment on the home lending segment where you are -- it seems like margins are starting to turn there and kind of better volume here in the back half of the year into '15? David Nelms : Well certainly gas prices all other things equal will depress a bit the sales gain because order of magnitude about 10% of credit card sales tend to be gas prices. So you can kind of multiply through and figure out what the impact is on total sales as gas prices go up or down. The knock on effect is that if people are paying less on gas then it tends to be somewhat helpful for credit. People may have more discretionary spend to put into other items besides gas. So there may be some off sets but all other things equal it does suppress sales a little bit if gas prices are down. In terms of student loans as I mentioned, I'm very pleased with the growth that we achieved. You know we always do report both on the organic portfolio and the acquired portfolio and so obviously the acquired portfolio which was sizeable when we purchased, it will continue to paydown as those students finish paying their loans in full, and so if you look at the organic growth portfolio you know we were up by more than 20% year-over-year. So that's quite healthy growth. Matthew Howlett - UBS: Just real quickly, any update on the home mortgage segment? David Nelms : Home mortgage continues to be a challenge. I think we had -- you know it is slightly suppressing our overall earnings you know maybe a penny a quarter. So it's not a big driver of our bottom line. It was never a big positive either, but the combination of a difficult business environment and a difficult regulatory requirements make that business challenging. I don't see either of those factors changing any time real soon. Matthew Howlett - UBS: You\u2019re still strongly committed to growing that? I mean could you look at possibly acquisitions? I mean is that something you still feel strongly about when you got into it? David Nelms : I would say that we\u2019re still figuring that out. I think that if you look back from -- we would have expected from the time we bought it four years ago to today we would have expected it to be you know further along but there has been a lot of changes, regulatory market, etcetera, since that time. So we are looking at options of what more do we need to do to make it more significant and a contributor. Operator : And our next question comes from David Hochstim from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. David Hochstim - Buckingham Research : Can you just talk about the -- is there a business benefit from eliminating that forfeiture reserve? Can they have lower attrition rates, higher customer satisfaction? David Nelms : We think that there is a business benefit, that's why we would be doing it. I think that one of the -- as we research rewards customers are pretty focused on an easy and good redemption process. It gives them more confidence since they earn these rewards that they know they're going to be able to actually redeem it. And historically our breakage was a much bigger savings if you will for the company. But between our card attrition which has come down to extraordinarily low levels, our delinquency rates which have come down to extraordinarily low levels. The ease of which we have given people -- we have made it so much easier to redeem through for instance Amazon Instant in any amount, so the breakage has come down to well below -- has come down to five basis points or lower which means we have to kind of say well could we cost effectively satisfy customers even more? And we would expect that both attracting new customers to our franchise as well as not losing customers and getting more wallet share that it wouldn't take much movement in any of those levers to offset five basis points of higher cost. David Hochstim - Buckingham Research : Okay and then just update us on the rewards checking and rewards for that when they become meaningful show up in same reward line as card rewards? David Nelms : Yes, they would. David Hochstim - Buckingham Research : Are they meaningful yet? David Nelms : No, they are not meaningful at this point. Operator : And our next question comes from Ken Bruce from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ken Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : My question also relates to what many of the questions are getting at as it relates to rising rewards cost and some of the other competitive dynamic that's playing out. I guess many financial institutions have suggested that they're willing to erode margins, cannibalize margins in order to improve customer loyalty and growth and as you have noted yourself you\u2019re seeing a pickup in that growth. I guess I'm wondering at what or how much are you willing to essentially erode your own margins in order to stay on the growth trajectory that you're on? You're operating well above the ROA hurdle, so some of the concern is that this business could quickly become a race to the bottom in terms of pricing competition not on APRs but in terms of rewards cost. I'm just trying to get a better sense as to how you think that the margin dynamic, the ROA dynamic plays out? How far are you willing to go in order to maintain your growth trajectory? David Nelms : Well I would say generally we are seeing people copy us. I mean people don't have the loyalty that we have. Historically people were not as focused on rewards as we've been. So I think when you look at competitors the big switch is they have moved their marketing from a mix of rewards and non-rewards to now almost all rewards and that would erode their margins whereas we have certainly invested more in cash back bonus [ph], you know a number of years ago we were closer to 80 basis points, we\u2019re now a bit north of 100 basis points of rewards cost. We have put in place the 5% program. We've got merchant funded rewards which doesn't hit our bottom line but benefits customers. As Mark mentioned we\u2019re considering reducing breakage which drives up costs but also satisfaction but we\u2019re being very careful do it in a levered and sustainable way so that we never get in the position of having to devalue rewards the way many of our competitors have over time. Mark Graf : I think you know the best fact that I can point to, to kind of underscore what David is talking about is if you look at year-over-year growth in receivables in the card space by far the largest component of that was just regular way spending, all right? So as people building receivables the old fashioned way, going out and using their Discover Card. So it doesn't feel like we're faced with anything like that kind of a decision at this point. Ken Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I guess as you kind of look out, I mean your success has been tremendous in many respects and you have pointed out a number of those. I guess it feels like the competition has maybe awoken to some of what's going on and I guess I am trying to understand if there is a backdrop for them to essentially become more competitive to the point where you all just are willing to see some of the growth that's maybe out there otherwise. David Nelms : I would say they woke up 10 years ago. I mean before that, we were pretty much the only game in town on cash rewards and now everyone has one or multiple cash programs, and so I'm not seeing any kind of inflexion point at this point. I just think that we\u2019re -- I think this very competitive rewards competition is not going to go away. It's the new normal but it has been for quite some time. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Chris Donat - Sandler O'Neill: I wanted to ask on the strategy you\u2019ve had well certainly in the third quarter than in prior quarters, also have -- of basically trading call it a little bit of NIM for extended maturities, is that a strategy we can expect you to continue assuming market conditions remain opportunistic? Mark Graf : Yes, I think that absolutely is a strategy you would expect to see us continue. I think we\u2019re just being realists in looking and saying in the future, we are not smart enough to tell you exactly when rates change but we are pretty confident there is really only one direction they can go and a balance sheet is a dynamic thing and continuing to take the right actions as inflows [ph] to make sure we are positioned from an asset liability management and earnings standpoint, the best we can. Yes we'll sacrifice some current margin right now to make sure we got that right. Operator : And our next question comes from Sameer Gokhale from Janney Capital. Please go ahead. Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital : Just a couple questions, going back to that $185 million charge and some of your commentary, David about I think you referenced the five basis points number as the forfeiture rate currently and if I heard you correctly I think you had attributed part of the decline in the forfeiture rate to improvements in credit quality as fewer charge-offs and so you have more redemptions. But if you assume that right now we\u2019re at a kind of a trough in terms of charge-offs and then charge-offs while relatively stable are likely to only move higher compared to where they're at now why eliminate all of that reserve now? Why not wait a little bit to see how that plays out? I mean I'm just curious about -- and again I think Mark I heard you say that all of that $185 million was just eliminating all of that forfeiture reserve. Mark Graf : Yes, so a couple things just to level set you before David answers there Sameer, what we said as we could do up to the 185. The 185 would be eliminating all of the forfeiture reserve. The other thing I would say is that you know we're considering a number of different pieces and there is still a few decisions to be made around that but we wanted to guide you towards you know what it could be. And then I think the other piece of the puzzle is the five basis points you're referencing. That is the ongoing incremental costs we will incur on our rewards rate as a result of having done that. It's not our current forfeiture rate. And it will actually be somewhat less than that five, I think we kind of hung five out there and said it would be somewhat less than that. We think we can manage that down a little bit. So there will be some incremental impact but probably not that full five. So that\u2019s just to align all the math there and now I will pass it over to David. David Nelms : Yes and I would say that we -- while I accept the point that delinquencies are at a low point likely now we don't expect them to go back to what they were for the industry or for us you know five years plus ago. And other than that the changes in terms of our loyalty rate as well as the changes that we've put in place like the Amazon redemption are more structural changes that we've put in place and we don\u2019t -- if anything we would expect breakage to become less and less as we try to replicate the success of things like Amazon maybe with some other people. So I don't think that the five basis points is suddenly going to grow to some you know higher number. I think it would be a modest cost for an anticipated good marketing and customer gain. Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital : Okay. And then you know on a different note you know just going back to your funding mix and deposits, you may have talked a few quarters ago but if you could refresh my memory when you look at the direct-to-consumer verses broker deposits, you know broker deposits have been growing -- direct-to-consumer deposits have been relatively flat and of course DTC [ph] seems to be more economical for you, brokerage, a little more expensive. So how do you think about that mix going forward and perhaps emphasizing direct-to-consumer more again or should we expect broker to continue to grow as a channel? Mark Graf : I would say as an organization we would always have a decided preference for the direct-to-consumer because it comes with a customer relationship and that gives us opportunities to cross sell and more effectively serve them. If you look at the component parts and pieces the direct-to-consumer business -- we built up pretty quickly in the crisis, right, and we built it by being a rate payer. Over the course of the last 3 to 4 years we\u2019ve gone through a very purposeful exercise to basically reposition ourselves in the rate tables and shake out what I would call our retail capital market depositors sitting in the DTC space. That\u2019s been a big part of what's driven our asset sensitivity we currently have on the balance sheet. So while DTC looks flat over the course of the last couple years, if you looked at components you would actually see good solid top line growth that isn't quite so rate driven and attrition of the folks with a beta of one or greater out of that book. The DTC, look it's a cost effective way for us to get some duration in the market place pretty effectively and pretty easily. David Nelms : Brokered. Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital : Excuse me, the brokered. Thank you, David. I appreciate that. It's a cost effective way for us to get some duration in the market place. And the other thing is we tend to use it as we head into the holiday season as we ramp up and see seasonality in the book as well because it's easy to flex up and then run back off after that period of time also. So we use it both for duration and we also use it for short term needs. Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital : So at what point do you think you will have that attrition done in the DTC deposit base of the folks with betas more than one? Mark Graf : I think it's an ongoing process right, because a bunch of that book historically was CDs. So as those maturities occur and I think you get our CD maturity schedule in our Annual Investor Day packet, you can look back on that one and kind of see what the maturities were coming at us and that will give you a good way to approximate what that rotation looks like. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to William Franklin for final remarks. Bill Franklin : Thanks Adrian. And thank you everyone for joining us. As a reminder the Investor Relations team will be here this evening to answer any more questions that you have. Everyone have a goodnight. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Leslie and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bill Franklin. Mr. Franklin, you may begin. Bill Franklin : Thank you, Leslie. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin as always with slide 2 of our earnings presentation which is on the Investor Relations section of discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs which are on our website and on file with the SEC. In the fourth quarter 2014 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Our call this afternoon will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A period, it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up, so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated. So now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David. David Nelms : Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Starting on slide 3 of the earnings presentation, we reported fourth quarter net income of $404 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.87 after some one-time charges in the quarter. Excluding these charges, adjusted net income was $553 million or $1.19 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. Mark will cover the details of the charges later, but the largest was the previously announced $178 million elimination of our credit card Rewards forfeiture reserve. We think the changes that we decided to make in our rewards program that resulted in this charge will be beneficial to our business and we are receiving favorable feedback from our card members. Our business model continues to deliver solid results. Turning to slide 4, Discover achieved total loan growth of 6% over the prior year. This was driven by strong growth in card and personal loans. Card receivables grew 6% this quarter. This growth is the result of the continuing success of Discover it driving new accounts and increasing wallet share with existing customers. Our focus on the prime revolver segment is working as evidenced by relative yield stability and profitable loan growth. Card sales for the quarter increased 5% from the prior year. Lower gas prices brought down the sales growth by roughly 1%. Private student loans grew 4% and when you look at the organic growth excluding the acquired portfolios, we achieved 22% growth year-over-year. Personal loans surpassed $5 billion in receivables, up 19% from the prior year. On the right side of slide 4, payments volume in total was up 2%. PULSE volume increased 4% from the prior year. Network Partners volume declined 13% due to the previously announced loss of volume from a third-party issuer. This runoff in Network Partners volume was partially offset by growing AribaPay volume, however, this volume is at a substantially lower margin. Diners volume increased 2%, but was up high single digits year-over-year on a real basis excluding FX. This was driven by strong volume growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Turning to slide 5, as we look back on 2014, our first priority was to grow Discover card loan share while maintaining leading credit performance. We grew card receivables by 6%, a pace that was meaningfully faster than the industry. The new accounts we originated are more active which speaks to the features and benefits of Discover it. We have made investments in customer experience and rewards and across all channels a card member may choose to access their account whether it is on a desktop, a tablet or a mobile phone. In 2014, Discover received the highest rating in the area of customer interaction and tied for highest total customer satisfaction with credit card companies according to J.D. Power. In addition, we launched a new rewards site, Discover Deals which provides card members with valuable offers and provides retailers with a low-cost, highly targeted marketing platform. I'm also very proud that our 2.3% card net charge-off rate is one of the lowest in the industry. We grew our non-card loans by originating $1.2 billion of private student loans and almost $3 billion of personal loans. Private student and personal loans combined drove non-card receivables growth of approximately 10%, at the top end of our long-term target of 5% to 10%. In payments, we lost some third-party volume and Network Partners and the competitive landscape in debit remains challenging. However, our global acceptance and reach of the Discover network is larger than it has ever been. Also, the Discover network continues to provide significant benefits to our card issuing business. In emerging payments, we are very pleased with the early results at the launch of AribaPay which generated $1.5 billion in volume in the fourth quarter. In terms of progress against optimizing our funding costs, we have continued to extend the duration of our funding by issuing longer term fixed rate debt and we took actions which we believe will make our deposits stickier when rates rise. In regards to optimizing our capital position, we repurchased 5% of our shares while also increasing our dividend. Lastly, we continue to enhance our operating model with our successful implementation of the deposit component of our core banking platform. Additionally, we continue to strengthen our compliance and controls infrastructure which will remain a focus in 2015. We will discuss our other 2015 priorities later this year at our financial community briefing but one preview I'll give you is that we plan on launching a new card product early this year. As we look back on 2014, we feel very good about how we executed on these priorities. We delivered net income for the year of $2.3 billion or $2.5 billion adjusted for the non-recurring charges in the fourth quarter and we achieved an ROE of over 20%. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark to discuss the details of our fourth quarter results. Mark Graf : Thanks, David. Good evening, everyone. I'll start with the revenue detail on slide 6 of our presentation. Net interest income increased $103 million or 7% over the prior-year, due to continued strong loan growth. Total non-interest income was down $195 million due largely to the previously announced $178 million one-time charge related to the elimination of the Rewards forfeiture reserve. Research we conducted showed that rewards that are easier to redeem and never expire are as valuable to a customer as a higher earn rate. Our adjusted Rewards rate excluding the charge, was 10 basis points higher than last year primarily due to a broader 5% cash back program in the quarter which included both online and department store sales. Protection product revenue continues to decline down $9 million year-over-year given our suspension of sales in late 2012. Other revenue decreased $11 million primarily due to the reclassification of some merchant fees that we previously discussed several quarters ago. This is the last quarter where this reclassification will impact year-over-year comparisons. Continuing on slide 6, Payment Services revenue was down $6 million for the quarter primarily due to the loss of the Sam's and Walmart co-brand volume and Network Partners. The transition is now largely completed, but will impact comparisons next year. This combined with the continuing competitive challenges at PULSE and the cost of a lawsuit filed by PULSE against a competitor to address these issues will result in a decrease in profits for our payment segment in 2015. Turning to slide 7, total loan yield of 11.4% was up 2 basis points over the prior year. The slightly higher loan yield was more than offset by higher funding costs which drove a 5 basis point decline in net interest margin over the prior year to 9.76%. Our cost of funds has increased as we've issued more long-term fixed rate debt over the last year. In addition, we're no longer seeing the same level of benefit from the maturity of CDs priced at rates considerably above those in the market today. These had been creating a meaningful funding cost tailwind in the last few years, but this opportunity has now largely played out. Turning to slide 8, total operating expense increased by $94 million or 11% over the prior year including $48 million in non-recurring items. One of the non-recurring items was the $27 million impairment of goodwill realized with the Discover Home Loans acquisition. We have not diversified beyond refinance volume into purchase money originations in a meaningful way and therefore we aren't driving a level of originations that we expected. Going forward we'll continue to evaluate our home loan strategy. The other non-recurring item in other expense was the $21 million mark to fair value related to Diners Club Italy. We acquired DC Italy to support acceptance in the region in June of 2013, but as we've consistently said, it's not part of our strategy to own this franchise long-term. We're now actively engaged in a sales process which is why it has been classified as held for sale. The three other key drivers of the increase in expenses year-over-year were additional marketing this quarter particularly in card and personal loans to drive new accounts, higher professional fees related to investments in web and mobile and higher employee compensation. Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on slide 9, provision for loan losses was higher by $103 million including a $52 million higher reserve build compared to the prior year. Net charge-offs increased by $51 million driven primarily by loan growth and to a lesser degree, lower dollar recoveries on aged charge-offs. The credit card net charge-off rate was 2.26%, up 17 basis points year-over-year and up 10 basis points sequentially. The 30-plus day delinquency rate was relatively flat at 1.73%. The private student loan net charge-off rate excluding purchased credit impaired loans was relatively flat year-over-year, at 1.4%. The 30-plus day delinquency rate increased by 14 basis points over the prior year to 1.8%, as the organic book continues to enter repayment. Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was up 20 basis points year-over-year to 2.2% due to the seasoning of growth. And the over 30-day delinquency rate was up 9 basis points to 79 basis points. Across all of our portfolios, we remain pleased with our strong credit results. Next I'll touch on our capital position on slide 10. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 14.1%. The sequential decrease in our capital ratios was driven by seasonal loan growth as well as continued capital deployment. We repurchased $400 million of stock in the quarter. To complete the $1.6 billion dollars of repurchases we submitted as part of last year's CCAR capital actions, we plan to buyback approximately $400 million worth of stock in the first quarter as well. Moving to 2015 guidance on slide 11, since our annual financial community briefing will be somewhat later this year, we felt it appropriate to provide some select guidance for 2015. We expect revenue margin to decline modestly from 12.9% this year. There are four main drivers of this compression. First, we expect modest NIM compression driven by increasing funding costs as well as a small decline in asset yields. Second, we anticipate protection product revenue will continue to decline. Third, we anticipate a Rewards rate of approximately 105 basis points in 2015 and the fourth driver is the lower payments revenue I discussed earlier. Moving down the list to provisions, we expect the provision for loan loss rate to increase from 2.2% for 2014 to approximately 2.5% for 2015. As we've been telegraphing, this expectation is primarily driven by the seasoning of several years of consistent loan growth as opposed to a fundamental deterioration in credit. With respect to operating expenses, we previously stated that we expect our efficiency ratio to be modestly above our 38% long-term target next year. The increase in operating expenses will be driven by higher marketing investments, higher regulatory and compliance costs including those related to remediation of our AML/BSA program consent order and the impact of increased technology investments. In conclusion, our outlook for 2015 reflects an end to the declining credit and funding costs that we've enjoyed in recent years as well as some increased regulatory and compliance expenditures. However, most of the fundamental operating trends of the business remain very solid. That concludes our formal remarks, so now I'll turn the call back to our operator Leslie, to begin the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We have Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : So two questions, first, I was wondering, Mark, if you could just dimensionalize how much of a decline you're talking about in the revenue margin when you say modest? Maybe you could just give us some rough sense of that. And then secondly one for David, maybe you could talk about the competitive environment and what you're seeing in terms of yields? Thanks. Mark Graf : Yes. So, Sanjay, we finished the year with a revenue margin of about 12.9%. We don't give specific EPS oriented guidance, so I'm going to be a little bit probably less specific than you would like me to be, but I can help you at least qualitatively dimension this a little bit. The biggest component of it's going to be a little bit of NIM compression. Again, I think we've consistently been describing that as modest NIM compression and we purposely chose to include the phrase modest in the release again this year. So I wouldn't think about this as a 50 basis point decline in NIM or something on the order of that. We certainly stay well above the long-term targets we've talked about. Second component that's going into that dimensionalization is obviously going to be your payments revenue. I think we talked during the course of the discussion, about the fact that there is going to be some expense related to the PULSE litigation against VISA that will be creeping in and also while we're growing volumes in the space, a lot of the volume we're growing is B2B volume in our Ariba partnership and it's coming on at a lower margin. The higher rewards rate, I think we've said about 105 basis points for next year is the right way to think about it and then just to continued attrition of the protection products revenue. So I would say there is nothing I would describe as cataclysmic in terms of those components. David Nelms : And Sanjay in terms of the competitive environment, I think it's been fairly stable on the yield side. As Mark mentioned, most of the pressure will come more on the cost of funds side and from a competitive perspective, I feel like things are fairly stable overall, but if anything I think there is probably more action in the rewards earn rate from some competitors as opposed to probably on the APR side. Operator : Next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : My question is around, Mark your comments around the provision, the guidance there. I understand you're looking for that to be up year-over-year due to expected seasoning, but what I'm wondering is, is that assuming some deterioration in the delinquency rates that we're not seeing? Because when I look at the data, charge-offs, gross charge-offs are basically still flat year-over-year, net up modestly due to lower recoveries and delinquencies are also pretty flat and stable and your customer just effectively got a raise with lower gas prices. So I'm wondering, what's embedded in your assumptions there? Mark Graf : I think there is a couple things embedded in the assumptions there, Mark and it's a great question. Number one, I would say is I think we really hit the bottom for this cycle, I would say with respect to credit this last year. So if you look at our reserve to our total loans trending over the course of the last couple years I think you see if you're looking at ending total loans, I think it was 3.8%, 3.9% at the end of 2011. It declined to 2.51% at the end of '13 and we're looking at 2.5% again roughly at the end of last year. So it feels like we've found the bottom there, right. So that's the starting point. And then on top of that, you look at three years of consistent loan growth that we've put up, whereas most of our peers have returned to loan growth really only like the last six months. And if you think the way a loan seasons, a card loan seasons, it tends to have peak charge-offs between months 18 and 30. So you really have -- that vintage from three years ago is still under the high part of that curve, the vintage from two years is right under the peak part of that curve. The vintage from last year is climbing that slope and you don't have the benefit of the backdrop of the improving credit environment to help mitigate and offset some of the impacts of that growth. So I think it's just an inevitability of the fact we've been growing. It doesn't feel like there is a problem. It doesn't feel like there is a fundamental turn in credit. It's just a function of growth. Operator : Next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Bob Napoli : I was just wondering if you had any updated thoughts on loan growth as we look into 2015. The loan growth that we saw this quarter in credit card and we've seen relatively stable, would you expect to continue to grow around that rate? And then, there has been a little bit of a slowdown in the personal loan business. So some thoughts around loan growth would be helpful. David Nelms : Sure. Well I think we'll probably have more to say about long-term targets at our Investor Day. But generally, I continue to be very pleased with how strong our loan growth has been, both in this quarter as well as the last few quarters. High end of the industry above our range and coming in with very high quality to boot. In terms of personal loans, I think the dollars of loan growth have continued to be very strong and what I would expect generally is that the percentage growth rate will tend to start declining a bit, just because of the large numbers, that's becoming a large, sizable loan book, but continues to be the fastest growing part of our portfolio and one of the fastest growth loan books in the industry. Bob Napoli : And then just on AribaPay, $1.5 billion in volume this quarter. Can you give a feel for the revenue yield you're getting on that and what kind of -- is that $1.5 billion -- how many customers does AribaPay have and how quickly is that going to grow? I mean it's pretty quickly -- $1.5 billion is a pretty big number to hit in a short period of time. David Nelms : It is, but remember, this is B2B, so even one customer can be very, very sizable and so you look at the size of that market. In total, it's a larger market than consumer credit cards and it's a new market for us, but it's also -- to some degree we're substituting for checks and other lower cost methods of payment than traditional credit cards. So it's a business that we think can produce, over time very significant volumes, but at much lower than the typical network fees that we might expect on the consumer side. Operator : Next question is from James Friedman with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. James Friedman : I had two questions, one for Mark and one for David. Mark on slide 8, you were calling out, I thought, three one-time events. I got the Discover Home Loans. I got the Diners Club Italy. I thought that there was a third one. Maybe I missed and then if I could a follow-up afterwards? Mark Graf : Yes. So there are three one-time items in total, Jamie. The first is the $178 million rewards charge for elimination of the forfeiture reserve. That\u2019s actually a contra-revenue that was covered on another slide and then there is two that are specific on the expense side of the equation and that's going to be about $0.04, $21 million roughly for the diners, fair market valuation and the move to held for sale or the classification of held for sale and then about $27 million or so roughly another $0.04 related to the home loans business. James Friedman : And then David, with regard to student loans, I just wanted to get your response in the instance that some of the proposals on Capitol Hill go through with regard to community college, I realize you don't extend loans to community college but how should we think about that as competitive dynamic? David Nelms : I think as you say because we aren't in the community student loan market, I really wouldn't expect that to have a significant impact on our business sort to go through. Operator : Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Just a question on the outlook for operating expenses, the 3.5 billion, when I think about some of the one-time costs that you outlined for BSA, ML and EMV, it gets the core expense growth rate closer to 3% so I guess, I know we are still far away from 2016 but would you expect any of these expenses to stay in the run rate? And if not do you think we could resume beyond '15 closer to the 3% or 4% growth expense rate? Mark Graf : Yes, I think there's definitely, Ryan some one-time impacts associated with next year. I think back in December actually at your conference we made mention of the fact that AML/BSA cost we saw was in the $70 million - $75 million range of something like that so that's clearly a piece of this puzzle. We would not expect that to be a recurring expense. The other big components of the increase really our marketing expense, David alluded to the launch of a new product and we've also spoken pretty openly about the fact we're getting great new accounts in terms both of numbers as well as the level of activity we're seeing out of those customers. So it doesn't feel like the time when credit is stable we're getting the right kind of results from marketing cost per account acquired are in-line, it doesn't feel the right time to pull back on that either and those are the two big drivers. The other pieces are really some technology spend, big chunk of which is amortization of money that's already been spent. And then there is the litigation that we talked about earlier the PULSE is filed as well. So those are -- they are some of the components there that are clearly have levers that can be dialed back when the time feels right. It just feels when the fundamental business is running well it's not the time to dial some of them back. Ryan Nash : And just one other financial question for you, when I think about the guidance for net interest margin compression, are there any assumptions for changes in the rate environment embedded in your guidance? And if so, what happens if interest rates don't rise? Does that change the trajectory of the net interest margin? Mark Graf : Yes. So the assumptions we use as we build off the forward curve which you guys can just always work off the same things, you're going to be looking at the same info we are that way. We have essentially focused our positioning on the multi-year impact of rising rates. Because if you think about it in the one-year timeframe, a card loan and a 10-year student loan react the same way when in reality that's not what will happen. So we're asset sensitive in a one year profile. We're essentially neutralized to the impact of rates through the cycle on the long tier basis as well based on the actions we've done and our actions going forward would be trying to protect that positioning in that multi-year look. It's really kind of where we're spending our attention on how we are focused. The toughest scenario for us is a steep in [inaudible] and we are flat essentially in that today, I think we might lose $9 million or $10 million it's not a lot and we're essentially flat. And a flattener which people are starting to talk about actually would be a slight benefit to us if it occurred on the front end of the curve. Operator : Next question is from Matthew Howlett with UBS. Matthew Howlett : The loan growth was strong. Obviously December numbers looked really good. I guess I just wanted a comment on the lower gas prices obviously, retail sales were weak in December and I think just one of your peers just said that that was a disappointment in December. Can you touch on anything in terms of if gas keeps on going lower, what that does potentially to spend or growth loan growth? Mark Graf : Well, generally I think lower gas prices is great for consumers. So I wouldn't express that as being disappointed. It certainly does have some negative impact on our sales growth and so our sales growth would have been -- with stable gas prices approximately 1% faster year-over-year. I've seen various theories out there as to whether customers you know what do they do with that extra money? Does it help them make their payments and therefore does it help credit? Do they spend it on other things? Do they save it? So far maybe because it's been such a short term and such a significant drop, we haven't noticeably seen it being spent in other places. And so that's why we've kind of called it out as some drag on sales, but good for consumers. Matthew Howlett : Is it as simple as if it was 10% of your volume like it is for the industry that gas prices fall 50% year-over-year? Did we look at that sort of taking that we just don't know what the difference is going to be if they decide to spend it in other areas? Is that sort of how to think about it? Mark Graf : I think that's a reasonable way to think about it. And historically it has been about 10% of our sales, right now it's something less than 10% of our sales. Matthew Howlett : And then just on the personal lending side, I mean it's a phenomenal growth and there was a slight uptick on delinquencies. Is that just sort of seasonality? Clearly there is a lot of competition entering the space. You still feel really good about pricing today in that market? David Nelms : Yes, I would say it's really more as opposed to seasonality seasoning. Much like in the card business there has been a lot of growth over the course of the last couple years there and you're starting to see the impact of that growth just naturally show up. So don't feel like there is any fundamental credit issue there to call out at all. In terms of the performance of the business, continues to feel very good to us. It's a great asset. The other thing I would call out around it is because I'm presuming your next question is the modest amount of yield compression we've had around that asset and the bottom line is it's not competitively driven. We are seeing our customers elect shorter durations. So if you go back a couple years ago the average duration was four years. Today the average duration is three years and they're fixed rate loans so it's just pricing down further down the curve. Operator : Next question from Jason Arnold with RBC Capital Markets. Jason Arnold : Just wondering if you could comment on what you've seen recently on the split between on card loan growth between new and existing accounts and then maybe comment on the propensity of borrowers to revolve here if you're seeing any kind of changes in borrowing habits there as well? Mark Graf : I think we've commented in the past that most of our growth is pretty balanced between growth in wallet share from existing customers and better retention of customers. As well as being balanced out with a similar amount from new accounts. And we're continuing to see that as similar relationship. Jason Arnold : Okay. And then just in general in the industry it seems like we've seen some of your competitors and peers picking up a little bit on loan balances. Maybe if you could broaden out that observation to kind of what your thoughts are around the space in general? Mark Graf : Well, I think that it does appear that the industry has finally turned the corner and is no longer shrinking. I think some of our competitors lost a lot of loans over the last several years and I guess I would just say that I'm not suggesting that our growth rate will necessarily pick up from here, but I think it's probably easier for us to sustain a higher level of loan growth in a growing industry versus a shrinking industry. Operator : Next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : I was sort of wondering David, if you could kind of talk a little bit about what -- I know you probably won't be too specific about the new product launch that you alluded to. I mean is it aimed at a different segment or what features should we be looking for? David Nelms : I don't want to preempt the launch. I would just say we'll have the details out very soon. The one thing I would say is that we do think our Discover It platform is something that can be leveraged into other products that have some of the advantages that Discover It offers including free FICOs and pricing features, lots of features that others don't have, but maybe something a little different than our traditional cash back bonus program. So stay tuned, we'll give you the details real soon. Moshe Orenbuch : Okay. Just as a follow-up, the provision guidance for 2015 actually is a little lower actually than the provision annualized rate in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about -- in other words you\u2019re expecting slightly higher credit losses, so maybe kind of square for us why the reserve addition is so large this quarter and actually fairly moderate into 2015? Mark Graf : Sure. I'll tackle that one, Moshe. I think the real key driver is -- I will take you back to the way we establish our reserves and that is we sit down at the end of every quarter and we look at the loss content we see embedded in the balance sheet over the forward-looking 12 months period of time. And it's really a function of in response to the earlier question as I talked about those three years of vintage [ph] seasoning how they're coming along. It's really a function of how much of those three vintages is under the peak part of that seasoning curve as we sit here and look right now. And it just happens to capture a large a large portion of each of those three vintages. So you're correct. In your assessment of what our guidance is essentially. Operator : Next question is from Vincent Caintic with Macquarie. Vincent Caintic : Just wanted to elaborate a bit more on the competitive environment for rewards, with your adjusted rewards rate of 10 basis points year-over-year and say call it five basis points because of your rewards redemption policy, would you say that the other five is stable or has room to grow? Is there more competition? And then also how do you think that plays out in terms of driving spend in loan growth? David Nelms : Well, I would say that it still will tend to modestly grow from here. Fourth quarter tends to be a heavier quarter. So I'm not saying grow from the 110, but I'm suggesting that on a year-over-year basis in addition to the change in redemption, the changes in redemption and breakage we also have more and more of our book is made up of Discover It that has a flat 1% and less and less of it therefore but fortunately is the up to 1% of our traditional more product. So that will tend to naturally drive it up. I think that as we think about the competitive intensity in rewards, it is one of the reasons we made the change on redemption because customers told us that in some ways, not losing their rewards was even more important than the headline rate. And it was a way for us to meet the competition, have advantages in ways that were greater value to consumers at lower cost to us and therefore is beneficial for us long-term. Vincent Caintic : Okay. And then switching products if you could describe the goodwill impairment on the Discover home loans and then you're forward view of the business, it seems like refis have been strong with a low rate strong with a low rate environment and just wanted to see what you're also seeing. Thanks. Mark Graf : It's Mark. I'll tackle that one. If you think about it when you put the goodwill on the books its valued based on the assumptions you have at that point in time and part of those assumptions were that we would have more success bluntly penetrating the purchase money marketplace and wouldn't be as refi dependent as the model is today. So I agree with you if you think about with the drop in loan rates, the refi pipeline probably looks a little bit stronger today than it did a few months back. No question about it, but the purchase money volume that we were counting on when we acquired the business just hasn't materialized yet. So that's really what's driving the impairment. In terms of a go forward look, I would anchor back to David's earlier comments my earlier comments. I think we'll evaluate our strategy around that business and try and figure out what the right thing to do is. Operator : Next question from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Chris Donat : Mark, just wanted to parse your language around the modest net interest margin compression, particularly on the asset side because I thought David had commented that there really wasn't much pressure on the asset side but I'm wondering if you're seeing a mix shift either in your cards or in the broader loan portfolio that's putting a there? Just wondering if it's something that's one more one-time in nature or more sustainable? Mark Graf : So how about if I parse it up a little bit more for you? I'm not going to dimensionalize it in terms of the size. Again I would say stick with modest which again I think if we were seeing anything giant, we would not choose the word modest but if you look at the components of the NIM compression about half of it is due to higher funding costs. About a quarter of it is due to lower asset yields and about a quarter of it is due to a combination of loan mix and interest charge-offs which run through margin for us. So that would be the component parts that are driving that NIM compression which again I would really underscore, it's modest NIM compression. Chris Donat : Got it. I just wanted to make sure I'm getting at here. And then switching gears to another product you mentioned the litigation around PULSE. Going back to September, the American Bankers Association endorsed the Discover Debit product. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any pickup in that or do you think maybe that business has been on hold pending really the Supreme Court non-decision this week to review the Federal Reserve rules implementing Durban? So anyway, looks like now that those rules won't be under the subject to appeal that there is more certainty in that. I'm wondering if you've got any expeditions around the Discover Debit product from here? David Nelms : You opened up some complicated topics and of course I really can't talk about the litigation part. Let me limit my answer to Discover Debit. We were real pleased with the endorsement by the ABA. We've been pleased with the discussions that we're having with issuers and I think it's early days to sort of accelerate our offering of a signature debit product. We are the only ones in the world who have it besides Visa and MasterCard. And I certainly think we look forward to providing better economics and flexibility than the only two options that have been out there up until this point. Chris Donat : Okay. And a sales cycle here will be measured in quarters, right? Not weeks or months? Is that fair? David Nelms : You know if we have significant deals, we would announce them. Certainly there is competitive challenge and I don't think the Supreme Court decision was really one way or another addressing the competitive challenge that is key to the pressure that's on all the pin debit networks in particular us, that I'm concerned about. But we've announced before that we have a dozen or so very small signature debit issuers and we're now starting to get to try to really go after some larger players to grow that volume. Operator : Next question is from John Hecht with Jefferies Capital. John Hecht : The question I have pertains to provisioning and charge-off trends. The guidance is premised on the seasoning of the loan balance and lower recoveries. I'm wondering as we step through calendar year '15, do you see these factors neutralizing? I guess what that means is in the absence of changes to the economic outlook or your consumer trends, is this provisioning rate a good trend rate going forward from there? David Nelms : Yes, I think as you look out it's going to depend on a number of different things. I know you prefaced it being a stable environment but I want to be careful with that one because it is a dynamic process part of which will depend upon what our growth rates look like, right? I mean if our growth rates tick up that would imply a couple years down the road so would the provisioning. If they slowdown that would imply in a stable credit environment that it would slowdown. So it's a multivariate equation so it's not as simple as just saying yes, that feels good. I think the key factors to keep in mind are it's driven by our growth, the fundamental credit backdrop remains really solid at this point in time. If that were to change that could change it. If our growth rate changes that could change it and then the declining recoveries on the aged charge-offs, I'll just remind you it's not a decline in the recovery rate, we're realizing on new charge-offs. It is we have a big pool of aged charge-offs we never sold back from the recession against which there is a declining ability to realize recoveries. That's maybe 10% of the ultimate impact of the increase give or take. So it's a declining percentage there. Operator : Next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : So I just had a question around the Ariba B2B business. I know you mentioned that it's in the early days, early stages here, but there was a relatively low discount rate on it. Maybe you could give us a sense of what your expectations are for how quickly that business is likely to grow? I know you mentioned that in the payments area you thought that B2B would have a negative impact on the overall discount rate which I get but it's a small piece so I'm wondering how fast you think it's going to grow and if incremental new business would come on at an even lower discount rate than the business you have right now? Mark Graf : Well, Betsy, I think we are likely to have a little more color by the time we have our Investor Day later this year. If you look at the $1.5 billion of volume just in the fourth quarter, not that long after launching, you can see that it's probably the most volume we've put on from anything this early in a program. So it has the potential to put up a lot of volume if it continues to grow and be successful as the early days suggest, but by definition, it's very low margin business and so if that becomes more material to the payment segment, it will have the impact of depressing the overall margin, but we do believe it will be additive to profits, just not at a very high rate and so overall we think it's a very good thing. It's also a little bit hard for us to predict because the product just hasn't existed in the marketplace because it's unique. Competitors haven't offered it. We are exactly the way we have, we have got a great partner. And it's off to a good start in the early days, but it is still very early days in a very new business. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So I get that and I'm just thinking out loud about how it's B2B, so clearly everyone's doing the math on either side of the table. And I would think that part of the benefit to you is maybe some flow or funding benefits you got from the flow associated with the payments. I don't know if that's accurate or not and I raise it in the context of industry shifted towards real time payments ultimately banking industry moving to real time payments. If that were to happen, would that change the dynamic on the pricing on the product? David Nelms : As you can imagine, B2B customers are quite sophisticated and so there is one of the benefits is it settles I won't say real time but very quickly. So there is not a lot of flow, there is not a lot of revenue, but it's a way to leverage our network in a way that we've not traditionally been able to leverage the network in a unique way to provide value to new sets of customers and that we think over time there may be additional products and services that can be bundled with it, but right now, we are focused on getting those early customers to be successful and to be feeling good about the product so that this thing can gain momentum. Our partner is the leader globally in this B2B space and so they are very excited about another way to help their customers have more efficient faster payments in a way that's not been available from any provider historically and so we are focused on growing the volume right now and having it flow successfully. Operator : Next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : I know you've had a couple questions on provision and reserve but I would just like to see if we can understand one thing a little bit better. I'm basically trying to figure out if something's a pattern or a coincidence. A couple of years ago you shifted to a December calendar year-end and what that meant was the sort of peak in terms of receivables December to the trough in receivables, March became more pronounced than when you were on a November to February year-end. And since that time, it looks like there has been a little bit more of a pattern of higher provisions in the fourth quarter and at least the last couple years what we've seen is a little bit of a reversal of that in the first quarter. It would help I think us and other folks to understand if that's something we should anticipate going forward. David Nelms : Yes, very fair question. I would say two things. Number one, what happens in the first quarter is dependent on what happens in the first quarter. I don't know what that is yet so the reserve will be set at the end of the quarter for what happens during the course of the quarter. But I think it's a very fair statement to say that the shift in the calendar year-end and the way that works did have an impact and influence on that one. I would say it's very modest, though, right? So again I would say what you're really seeing this year speaking to this year specifically is those three years of growth and how much of them happen to be sitting under the peak part, the area under the peak of that seasoning curve at any one point in time. Operator : And the last question is from Owen Lau with Janney Capital. Owen Lau : Try to touch on the question on the revenue side again. How should we think about the net interest income in 2015? Just directionally do you see it going up, flat or down? Also on the expense side could you please shed more light on why did you increase spending on the marketing by $27 million year-over-year? So what was the trigger of that? Is it related to the product cycle or high competition on card and personal loans? What was the thought process behind it? Thank you. Bill Franklin : Owen, it's Bill. Can you repeat the revenue question? The first part of your question? Second question is on expenses and what are driving expenses of I think? And marketing? Owen Lau : Yes, sure. So on the revenue side, how should we think about the net interest income in 2015? Just directionally do you see it going up or flat or down? How should we think about that? Mark Graf : Yes, I would say it's going to be a function of a couple different things, Owen. It's going to be a function of asset growth. It's going to be a function of NIM compression. It's going to be a function of asset mix, right. All those different pieces of the puzzle, so in terms of trajectory, I think net interest income will be up, okay, but in terms of the magnitude of that, that's not something I'm prepared to really talk about at this point in time. We don't really give guidance that specific on items like that. On the expense side of the question, I would say specifically that the key drivers of expenses touched on a couple of them earlier. One of them is about $70 million or $75 million for BSA/AML consent order compliance program compliance. In addition to that I would say there is another not insignificant number related to increased marketing expense, that's really driven by two different things. Number one we continue to see great new account acquisition and we continue to see it come on more actively engaged using the card more frequently and more often than we've seen historically, so the returns on that marketing spend continue to be very good. So we are continuing to invest there and then David also alluded to the launch of a new product here in the not-too-distant future and obviously there is some marketing expense that goes along with that as well. David Nelms : But I think if you're asking just about that $27 million, it's up 3% year-over-year which isn't that significant. The fourth quarter tends to be our biggest quarter on marketing expenses as we move into holiday periods and we saw that again this year. Operator : Okay. I'll turn it back to Bill for final remarks. Bill Franklin : Thanks, Leslie. I would like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. If you have any other follow-up questions feel free to give me a call. Have a good night. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the Q1 2015 Discover Financial Services earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Bill Franklin. You may begin. Bill Franklin : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin as always with slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC today in an 8-K report and in our 10-K, which are on our website and on file with the SEC. In the first quarter 2015 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our chairman and chief executive officer, and Mark Graf, our chief financial officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A period, it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up, so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated. So now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David. David Nelms : Thanks, Bill. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us today. For the first quarter, we delivered net income of $586 million, earnings per share of $1.28, and a return on equity of 21%. Our direct banking business continues to deliver solid results. Discover achieved a total loan growth of 6% over the prior year. This was driven by strong growth in card loans, personal loans, and private student loans. Specifically, we grew card receivables by just over 5%, at the upper end of our targeted range. Card sales volume for the quarter was up 3%. Excluding the impact of gas prices, sales were up approximately 5%. Our growth continues to be driven by a combination of wallet share gains with existing customers and from new accounts. Our Discover it product continues to attract customers as we innovate and offer new industry leading features such as our recently announced Freeze It capability, which allows card members to temporarily suspend their accounts in the event a card is misplaced. In the quarter, we also launched our new Discover it Miles card. We believe this card will appeal to a different segment of our target market, prime revolvers who value travel rewards. This card leverages our Discover it platform with all of its innovative customer features to offer a unique value proposition in a crowded market. It will take time to become a meaningful portion of our new accounts, but we\u2019re optimistic about the long term value it will generate. Our other direct lending products also continue to perform well. The organic student loan portfolio increased 20% and personal loans grew 18% over the prior year. Focused on our payments business, total volume for the segment was flat, as increases in our proprietary volume and growth in our business to business volume offset year over year declines at Pulse. On a reported basis, Diners volume was down 1%. However, adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange rates, Diners volume was up more than 10% year over year, driven by strong results in several regions, especially Asia Pacific. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our results this quarter. I look forward to sharing more of our thoughts about the year ahead at our financial community briefing on May 5. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark, and he\u2019ll walk you through the details of our first quarter results. Mark Graf : Thanks, David, and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019ll start by going through the revenue detail on slide five of our earnings presentation. Net interest income increased $66 million or 4% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth. Total noninterest income increased $27 million to $542 million, as higher net discount interchange revenue and direct mortgage related income more than offset the continued decline in protection product revenue. Net discount interchange revenue was up 6%, driven by increased sales and a lower rewards rate year over year. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 102 basis points. On a reported basis, the rate was down 1 basis point year over year, but I would remind you that last year we recognized a forfeiture adjustment in the first quarter, so on an adjusted basis, the rate is actually up about 6 basis points. Sequentially, the rewards rate was down significantly as the rate last quarter included a onetime charge for the elimination of our rewards forfeiture reserve, as we changed our programs so that cardholder rewards never expire. Direct to mortgage related income increased this quarter as the refi market picked up due to the decline in mortgage rates several months back. As we\u2019ve said in the past, Discover Home Loans has been contributing or costing $0.01 or $0.02 of EPS most quarters, and this quarter, we were on the positive side of that range. Protection products revenue declined $12 million as new product sales remain suspended. Moving to payment services, revenue decreased 6% or $5 million from the prior year, mainly due to the previously announced loss of the Sam\u2019s and Walmart cobrand volume network partners. Volume for the segment, on the other hand, was relatively flat as growth in lower-margin B2B transactions mostly offset the loss and lower debit volumes. Overall, we grew total company net revenues by 4% for the quarter. Turning to slide six, total loan yield of 11.37% was 7 basis points lower than the prior year, primarily driven by a 9 basis point decrease in card yield. The year over year decrease in card yield reflects a small shift in portfolio mix as high rate balances are replaced by standard or promotional rate balances. Personal loan yield decreased from the prior year, primarily driven by more customers opting for shorter term consolidation loans. Funding costs increased 10 basis points due to higher fixed rate debt issuances in the last 12 months. Year to date, we\u2019ve completed two debt issuances, a $500 million 10-year fixed rate senior note and a $950 million 3-year floating rate ABS deal. We continue to position the balance sheet in anticipation of gradually rising rates. Higher funding costs and lower total loan yield resulted in an 18 basis point decrease in net interest margin from the prior year to 9.69%. Turning to slide seven, operating expenses were up $89 million over the prior year. Employee compensation increased $24 million due to higher headcount to support growth, annual salary increases, and higher commissions associated with the increase in home mortgage originations. Marketing expenses increased $13 million as we invested in advertising for several products. Professional fees increased $28 million due in part to approximately $15 million in costs associated with anti-money laundering and related compliance program enhancements. Other expense was up due to a $20 million legal reserve addition. For the quarter, our total company efficiency ratio was 40%. Excluding the two unusual items I just mentioned, the total company efficiency ratio is roughly 38.5%, in line with our long term target. Turning to provision for loan losses and credit, on slide eight, provision for loan losses was higher by $118 million compared to the prior year, due to higher reserves and chargeoffs driven primarily by loan growth. This quarter, we increased reserves by $30 million, while last year we had a $57 million reserve release. The credit card net chargeoff rate increased by 14 basis points from the prior quarter and by 8 basis points year over year, to 2.4%. The 30-plus day delinquency rate of 1.64% declined relative to both the prior quarter and the prior year. A portion of the drop was driven by the implementation of some payment processing changes during the quarter. On balance, the credit backdrop continues to remain benign. The private student loan net chargeoff rate, excluding purchased loans, decreased 28 basis points in the prior year, partially due to more efficient collections strategies, as well as the introduction of several new payment plans over the last year. Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, decreased 13 basis points to 1.66%. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations. Switching to personal loans, the net chargeoff rate was up 15 basis points from the prior year and the over 30 day delinquency rate was up 8 basis points to 76 basis points. The year over year increase in the personal loan chargeoff rate was primarily driven by the seasoning of recent loan growth. One last item I\u2019ll call out on the income statement is that we were able to recognize some prior year state tax benefits, which reduced our effective tax rate to 35.5% for the quarter. Next, I\u2019ll touch on our capital position, on slide nine. Our common equity tier one capital ratio increased sequentially by 60 basis points to 14.7%, due to the seasonal decline in loan balances from the fourth quarter. As previously announced on March 11, Discover received a nonobjection from the Federal Reserve on proposed capital actions during the five quarters ending June 30, 2016. We were pleased with the outcome and how we lined up versus other banks in terms of our capital ratios in the stress scenarios. Based on the proposed capital actions, we plan to repurchase $2.2 billion of our common stock over the next five quarters, and last week, our board increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.24 to $0.28 per share. In summary, it feels like a good start to the year, with strong loan growth and a continued benign credit environment. That concludes our formal remarks, so now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Bill Franklin. Bill Franklin : Hello, everyone. Only a few people are in the queue right now, so I\u2019m going to ask everyone to please dial 1. You may have already done this, but please dial 1 again, if you would like to ask a question. Thank you. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator. Operator : [Operator instructions.] And our first question comes from Rick Shane from JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Mark, you talked a little bit about on the personal loans you\u2019re seeing a pickup in losses in terms of seasoning. I\u2019m really curious if you were to disaggregate the credit card portfolio, are you seeing the seasoned portfolio, any deterioration there? Or is it really just normalization of the newer loans that\u2019s driving\u2026 And again, it\u2019s a slight uptick, but the movement in chargeoffs? Mark Graf : Rick, I would say, kind of as we\u2019ve been telegraphing, the credit environment really does remain generally very benign. So the seasoned portfolio has really stabilized at this point in time. I would say the movements we\u2019re seeing are directly related to the loan growth we put on over the course of the last three to four years and the seasoning of that growth as it moves through the vintage curves. Rick Shane : So it\u2019s basically convergence, it\u2019s not an uptick on the larger portfolio? Mark Graf : That\u2019s correct. Operator : And our next question comes from James Friedman. James Friedman : First, David, with regard to the new Discover it card that you\u2019re introducing into the market with Miles, maybe more generally if you could talk about the competitive environment and how you\u2019re positioning that product. David Nelms : Of course, Discover it remains our flagship product, and we continue to enhance Discover it with the introduction of the Freeze on/off switch, which we just introduced on that this quarter. We continue to enhance in areas like free FICO over time, and that\u2019s in part to basically stay ahead of competitors in value to consumers and things that can be differentially marketed. The Discover it Miles card is on the same Discover it platform, but adds a new currency in terms of miles primarily positioned to people who travel or really value free travel. And I would think about it as more of an extension. We do think it will appeal to certain segments, and may directly go up against other competitors when they have miles type cards, whether cobrand or otherwise. And so we think it positions us well to compete in the marketplace. James Friedman : And then just one quick follow up. I wanted to ask, have you seen the impact at all yet from the marketplace type vendors like Lending Club? I know it\u2019s more personal lines than they\u2019re fixed amortizing loans, but do you see them at all at this point, or is it too early? David Nelms : It\u2019s a little hard to track. There\u2019s no doubt that we must be running up against them some in the marketplace, because as you say, some of them have grown and have been very aggressive. They tend to play in a broader credit spectrum than we do, if you look at our 750 plus FICO score, and you compare it to those folks. There\u2019s a lot of people that they might book that we might not. But there would no doubt be some overlap, so we\u2019re watching what they\u2019re doing and if we can learn some things that can help us, we won\u2019t be shy about paying attention to them. Mark Graf : I would just tack on to that, the yield compression we\u2019ve seen to date in the personal lending book is really attributable to the shortening of the duration the consumers are choosing. Going back a year or so ago, they picked a four year average amortization period. Today, they\u2019re picking a three year period. So as a fixed rate loan, it\u2019s just pricing further down the curve. Operator : And our next question comes from Bill Carcache of Nomura. Bill Carcache : Mark, can you talk about when you think we might expect to see you guys reach the point where the seasoning on new account acquisition growth rate, that kind of stabilizes? And I guess with that, your provision begins to grow more in line with your loan growth, such that it\u2019s no longer a headwind to your EPS growth? I was just wondering if maybe you could give a sense for how far we are from that point, assuming of course that credit remains benign. Mark Graf : Bill, I would tell you it really depends on what happens to our growth rates. So a big piece of this puzzle is, if you think about, I\u2019ll visually draw you a vintage curve here, and kind of say, now, overlay four years of growth of those vintage curves. What\u2019s driving really the reserving is the area shaded under the peaks of all four of those curves overlaid on top of one another. So theoretically, if you think about a vintage curve, as you do another year or two worth of growth, that really begins to stabilize if your growth rate is really stable. If you\u2019re growth rates accelerate, theoretically, it\u2019s going to take longer for that to happen. The good news is I think this is a really good problem to have, because we can\u2019t shrink our way to long term success. And ultimately, acquiring new card members and growing the book is the way we compound value over time. So while I understand obviously the impacts in the near term, I think over the long haul, it\u2019s, again, a pretty high class problem. Bill Carcache : So as far as you could tell, over the course of, call it, the next 12 months, those seasoning effects will lead to continued reserve building I guess at a level on particular with this quarter, or perhaps maybe even a little bit higher? Mark Graf : I guess what I would say is we don\u2019t provide forward guidance really on what we expect the reserves. We did at the beginning of the year give a sense for what we kind of expected on the full year in terms of provision rate, is really kind of where we touched on it. What I would do is I would take you back to our earlier comments and I\u2019d just say the credit environment remains really benign. So really, the provisioning you\u2019re seeing from us at this point in time is the result of that high class problem of growth, and not anything related to any deterioration in the portfolios. Bill Carcache : And then I guess on a related point, and then I\u2019ll drop back out, I didn\u2019t hear any update on that 2.5 provision guidance. We assume that that continues to hold, that you guys gave last quarter. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the applicability of that? I know the investor day\u2019s coming up and there\u2019ll probably be more there, but anything you could say on it now would be great. Mark Graf : I would kick it to the investor day for a more fulsome update. I guess what I would say, just very quickly, is I don\u2019t see any reason to change that guidance at this point in time. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Donat of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Chris Donat : Mark, wanted to go back to the other income line that was $80 million this quarter. I think you said it was primarily from higher direct mortgage related income. Can you just remind us what kind of mortgages you\u2019re doing there? And I guess we have to make our own assumptions about how those fees are likely to operate given the rate environment we\u2019re in. But is it all kind of fixed rate product, like 30 year? Or is there other types of mortgages in there? Mark Graf : There\u2019s a variety of product in there. I would say it\u2019s all conforming product, and it\u2019s all being packaged for sale. So we\u2019re not retaining any of that product on our own balance sheet. I would say if you look year over year, that other income item was up somewhere on the order of $29 million or $30 million, if I remember correctly. Roughly, let\u2019s call it, two thirds of that is related to the mortgage business, so it was the largest driver of the increase that was embedded in there. And I think it\u2019s really a reflection that the fixed rate volumes picked up pretty dramatically as you saw the drop in the long treasury rates at the end of last year. And it takes a little while for that pipeline to kind of flow through the system, so I think that\u2019s really the impact to what you\u2019re seeing there. Chris Donat : And this is refi or new originations? Mark Graf : I would say at this point in time, the vast majority of our business continues to be refi oriented. Operator : And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : David, I had a question about interchange rates and I guess the discount rate for you guys. We\u2019re seeing a decent amount of competition in the cobrand space. I know you guys have experienced it firsthand. I was wondering if you had just any broad thoughts on kind of interchange rates and then whether or not you felt any pressure from other merchants recently given what we\u2019re hearing. David Nelms : Well, I think that the big merchant discount interchange rate story that I guess I\u2019ve seen recently has been sort of the two warehouse clubs that I would just say feel like more unique situations. And there\u2019s not broad acceptance in either of those locations, and therefore the rates that we\u2019ve all seen printed seem very low compared to others. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily draw any conclusions about an impact on that more broadly. I think they\u2019re unique. On the cobrand, I think that\u2019s a little different, and I\u2019m not sure it shows up in interchange, but what we see is that the cobrand market seems to have really heated up, and it has become very competitive in terms of terms, and it makes me glad that we\u2019re not in the cobrand business. More broadly, I haven\u2019t noticed any trends one direction or another on merchant discount rate or interchange in the market. Sanjay Sakhrani : And then just a follow up question on M&A. I guess any updates there on opportunities that you guys might be seeing to use some of the excess capital you guys have? Obviously, there\u2019s a large pool of financial assets out there for sale. Not sure if you have any interest in that, but maybe just an update on that topic? And then Mark, just one data point question. The tax rate going forward, we should just assume it reverts back to like 38%? David Nelms : On M&A, we may have a little more to comment on at investor day, but in a nutshell, I\u2019d say our primary focus is on organic growth. And I\u2019ll shoot it over to Mark for the other. Mark Graf : On the tax rate, I would say there might be a little bit of goodness in the tax rate this year, but not anything particularly meaningful. Operator : And our next question comes from David Hochstim from Buckingham. David Hochstim : Could you expand maybe on what impact you\u2019ve seen from lower gas prices, aside from the headwind on spending? Have you seen any changes yet in customer spending or behavior during the quarter, gas related or not gas related? David Nelms : Well, we called out that the gas prices alone had a pretty significant impact, about 2% I guess, on our sales. And I think that there would be a small knock on effect on loan growth as well. There\u2019s a lot of transactor volume within gas, but obviously some of it would also evolve. You know, what is maybe a little surprising to me so far is I might have expected some of that increase in discretionary spending that consumers have left to have been spent on other things. And I really didn\u2019t see that during the quarter. We saw retailers broadly not have great sales. There\u2019s some view that a lot of people are talking about the weather having an impact in the quarter, but I guess I am hopeful that the broader economy and the broader consumer spending would pick up, even apart from gas, in the future. But we just didn\u2019t see it during the quarter. I guess the other question is what are they doing with the money? It seems to be an increase in savings rate. I\u2019ve seen some comments about whether it\u2019s benefitting credit. It certainly shouldn\u2019t be a negative for credit, but I think it\u2019s a little early for me to conclude that lower gas prices are going to improve credit results. David Hochstim : And did you see any change in consumer spending over the course of the quarter? Was February particularly weak because of weather, do you think? David Nelms : You know, March was a bit better than January and February, but still, March still wasn\u2019t where I\u2019d like to see it. And we\u2019ve seen Moody\u2019s and a number of people take down their forecast for the year. This was a broad industry kind of thing. We\u2019ve seen most of our competitors lower growth rate on sales and we certainly experienced that in our customer base as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Bob Napoli : On the growth in student loans and in the consumer portfolio, they both slowed down somewhat. The consumer was almost flat quarter over quarter from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. That\u2019s been growing year over year close to 20%, the same with the student loan ex PCI. Is that competition from the marketplace lenders and student lending and consumer, or do you still expect to be able to grow those portfolios along the same lines that you have been the last couple of years? David Nelms : I tend to look at year over year changes to help remove the seasonality in really all the business, but particularly in student loans. And our origination volume in both of those businesses in dollars has continued to grow nicely. And so I think what we\u2019re seeing is percentages, even if you increase originations and you increase dollars of loans off of a higher base, the percentages could modestly [decrease]. But if anything, we\u2019re picking up the dollar growth. Mark Graf : The other thing I would note is just that obviously the student loan business is lumpy in terms of disbursement cycles. So you have to take that into account in terms of the periods you\u2019re comparing as well. Bob Napoli : And just on the B2B business, the Ariba business, it looks like you\u2019re getting some pretty large volume, but what should we expect from a volume perspective? And is line of sight to that being material to your business, is that 12 months, 24 months? How is that business progressing and when can it move the needle? David Nelms : You know, it\u2019s going to be sometime before it really contributes in any meaningful way to profits. But without forecasting exact numbers, we do expect the volume to continue to grow. And it seems to be very well received. It\u2019s unique, and it seems to be very well received by some businesses and by the partners of SAP and Ariba. Operator : And our next question comes from Don Fandetti from Citigroup. Don Fandetti : Mark, I was wondering if you could provide some thoughts on the card yield and also the efficiency ratio over the next couple quarters. And then David, do you think there will be any impact or change to the rewards competitive environment when short term rates rise? Mark Graf : I\u2019ll tackle the first couple. And I remember the first one is card yield, and then I\u2019m forgetting. I\u2019m sorry, what was the second? Don Fandetti : Card yield and [unintelligible]. Mark Graf : Efficiency ratio. You got it. So, from a card yield perspective, I would say the real compression thus far has been driven really by more what I call portfolio mix across the card business. So what we\u2019re continuing to see is pre-CARD Act higher rate balances continue to run off. And given the very positive credit environment right now, that bucket\u2019s not getting refilled quickly. And where we are seeing greater growth, obviously, is in what I would call the standard price receivables, as well as promotional receivables also. So I would expect that phenomenon would continue to play out over the coming quarters and you would see some relative stability to modest compression in card yield. In terms of the adjusted efficiency ratio, what I\u2019m doing basically on that one is I\u2019m just taking the reported efficiency ratio of around 40%, I\u2019m backing out the $20 million legal reserve addition, and I\u2019m backing out the $15 million related to AML BSA remediation efforts, really kind of calling them out as noncore kind of things. And on a core basis, your efficiency ratio comes out at 38.5%. Don Fandetti : And that\u2019s kind of still where you\u2019re thinking? Mark Graf : Yeah, I think what we\u2019ve said for the year is that we expect we\u2019ll be slightly above that 38% target range. And I don\u2019t see any reason to dissuade you from continuing to focus on that guidance. David Nelms : And on rewards, I think to a large degree, we\u2019re at a new normal. I mean, consumers love rewards. That\u2019s what\u2019s working. And therefore, competitors have migrated to rewards generally. Cash rewards, I think particularly is working well, and therefore you\u2019re seeing competition in that space. I think that if some issuers start getting pressured on profits, and whether that\u2019s from rates or chargeoffs or other factors, higher marketing costs is an example, the ones who may have gone to an unsustainably high level of rewards probably will make an adjustment. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in the past. But I\u2019m not sure that the average rewards rate for the industry and for us is unsustainable in the long run in terms of producing a good profit margin and providing great value for consumer. Operator : And our next question comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Just a couple of questions on expenses. First, the $20 million addition to the legal reserve, was that contemplated in your $3.5 billion guidance? And on the $15 million of BSA AML, how do you expect the remaining 60 to ramp? Would you expect it to be front loaded or would you expect it to be a little bit more evenly spread throughout the remaining quarters of the year? Mark Graf : I would say no, the $20 million was not contemplated in the guidance we gave, number one. Number two, I would expect you will see the expense ramp a little bit associated with the AML BSA remediation activities. Ryan Nash : And then just as a follow up to that, has anything changed from what you told us last quarter on the expense front? Do you continue to believe the $110 million of incremental expenses for BSA E&B will be one-time in nature? Mark Graf : I believe the specific expenses we called out will be one-time in nature. I think as we think about our business planning, there will be some run rate expenses that we think we can cover with other operational efficiencies and everything else related to some of those matters. So just to be clear, it\u2019s really the nonrecurring things where we\u2019re not changing our guidance on those things at this point. Ryan Nash : And if I could squeeze one more in, on the net interest margin you outlined, the issuance that you\u2019ve done thus far, should we assume NIM pressure to continue in this mid-single digits level until rates rise? I know you\u2019ve talked in the past about wanting to make the balance sheet rate neutral through the cycle, which I believe you guys are at or at least close to. How should we think about how much more insurance you guys want to buy to protect against higher interest rates? Mark Graf : Great question. I guess what I would say is yeah, we guided to that modest compression quarter over quarter this time around, and kind of what we saw was really in line with our expectations. Looking at second quarter, I think you can probably expect a similar or somewhat similar decline there for the second quarter, about half driven by yields and about half by funding costs, plus or minus. Beyond next quarter, I would say the pace of the decline really begins to level off quite a bit. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to pierce a 950 margin or something this year. Operator : And our next question comes from Jason Harbes from Wells Fargo. Jason Harbes : Question on EMV. The merchant liability shift is still months away, but we\u2019re already hearing requests for a delay. Can you maybe share your perspective on the EMV implementation along with some of the potential costs and benefits? David Nelms : That would be a big topic, so I\u2019m not going to try to fully address it. Again, at investor day, we\u2019ll try to tackle it a little more broadly. I think that it\u2019s important that we all try to hit the October date. This has been a long time in the works. It\u2019s been a date that was set quite some time ago. And as an industry, we know we need to do something to better control security and fraud losses. And frankly, we could issue all the cards we want with chips, but if there\u2019s not terminals to use them, it actually would cost us money. There would be zero fraud savings. And I think it\u2019s in the merchants\u2019 best interest to try to get there, if anything more than it is for the issuers, when you look at some of the breaches that have happened. I think more broadly, I expect that this is going to be a somewhat rocky rollout for the industry. This is a huge change for consumers, for people at point of sale. Consumers are going to have to start dipping their card instead of swiping it. Some merchants are going to be different. So I think that merchants, acquirers, issuers, we\u2019re all going to be having to help educate consumers on the new way it works. And that\u2019s what we saw in other places in the world where EMV rolled out, is that it took a while to smooth out the edges and fundamentally change something that\u2019s been in place for a few decades. Jason Harbes : And maybe as my follow up, can you remind us what are your capital deployment priorities, and what would be a reasonable timetable for hitting your 11% target? Mark Graf : I would say the capital deployment priorities remain first and foremost continued investments in organic growth in the business. I would say second of all, to the extent it\u2019s permissible under the current CCAR restrictions, returning it to shareholders. The reason those are number one and number two is because we think they have very definable returns associated with them and make a lot of sense. The third priority, I would say, would be what I would call acquisitions of financial assets as opposed to operating businesses. But those would really have to be financially motivated buys, because obviously, if you buy in a trading book, you don\u2019t get growth. It makes growth more challenging. So I would say they\u2019d have to be financially motivated buys. And then last but not least, I would say with respect to traditional acquisitions, I would say that\u2019s fourth of four. There\u2019s a pretty high bar there, right? I think you\u2019ve got integration risk, execution risk, diligence risk, key person retention risk. So the bar on traditional M&A is pretty high. And you know, while the BSA AML thing is out there, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s primarily our focal area either. Operator : And our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Maybe just a little bit of a follow up on the it Miles product. I\u2019ve seen some of the solicitations coming out, and I\u2019ve seen from the mail data that your numbers are starting to pick up. Can you give us a sense of the timing of that rollout and maybe what impact it might have on spending and receivables? David Nelms : We\u2019re still in a ramp up phase, but A) it will be significantly smaller than the flagship Discover it card, even when it\u2019s sort of fully deployed. And B) you should expect some substitution. It\u2019s not pure incremental marketing solicitations or dollars. We\u2019ll be marketing Discover it Miles where we think we can get better response rates, better returns, better activation and usage versus the flagship. And we may be doing some alternating of products as well. So I think bottom line, I wouldn\u2019t think about Discover it Miles as being something that will necessarily accelerate growth, but hopefully, to help us to maintain growth. We\u2019ve obviously been growing much faster than the industry in the past several years, and we have to innovate if we\u2019re going to keep that up. Operator : And our next question comes from John Hecht from Jefferies. John Hecht : You said commentary in the context of deposit and liability management. You have a little bit of a step up in excess liquidity. We\u2019ve learned, I guess, a little bit more maybe, about the rate cycle. What should we think about you guys over the next few months in terms of managing your liabilities and thoughts on deposit [fundraising]? Mark Graf : I would say a couple of different things there. Number one, the balance sheet today has been positioned to be what I would call modestly asset sensitive. Sort of what\u2019s caused the margin compression, or a big cause of the margin compression, we\u2019ve consciously taken, over the course of the last couple of quarters, to build that positioning, right? So I think if you think about not just a one year forward NII, but if you think about the 10 forward years and the NII impact in each of those 10 years, we\u2019re managing to be net positive through the cycle, if you will, with respect to our asset liability positioning. So we will continue to make those investments. So if you think about the liability side of the balance sheet and how it contributes to that, I would say a couple of things. Number one, I would say we as a team will always favor deposits over capital markets liabilities. They come with customers attached to them. We can cross sell to customers. There\u2019s a fulsome relationship that can be built there. So we will always lean on using our balance sheet to service our customers and funding it with our customers\u2019 deposits. So that being said, I think the model is such that we\u2019re not going to necessarily be the highest rate payer in town. That\u2019s not our goal. But we\u2019re going to be a very fair rate payer relative to traditional banks. I would say with respect to the capital markets, things we\u2019ve done there, I think we\u2019ve gotten the balance sheet into the position we want to see it, so I wouldn\u2019t expect a lot of fixed rate funding from this point. Not saying none, but I wouldn\u2019t expect a lot. What we would do from this point forward would be to protect the positioning we\u2019ve built as the balance sheet grows and shifts in composition as opposed to trying to structure a more asset sensitive position. John Hecht : And the related question is, I\u2019m wondering if you could give us an update on the rollout of the cash back checking, or is that something you just keep in your pockets as rates go up? David Nelms : We are making efforts to increase the cross sell and we\u2019re continuing to enhance the feature functionality of the product. And we\u2019re hopeful that by year-end we\u2019ll be ready for broad market launch, but frankly, for now, we\u2019re continuing to focus on the cross sell. Operator : And our next question comes from Ken Bruce from Bank of America. Ken Bruce : My question really is a follow up to James Friedman\u2019s question about the marketplace lenders. I understand that it may be a little early and you\u2019re kind of watching and learning, but I guess there\u2019s been a lot of capital raise recently and a lot more focus on that particular model, so one would suspect that there\u2019s going to be more activity than less going forward, and they\u2019ve specifically targeted revolving credit and essentially debt consolidation within the sector as a primary area of growth. So how do you think about that competitively? Do you think that it\u2019s a real risk? And I guess in your early stages, what would be your response to compete against those? David Nelms : You know, I think that at the margin, our personal loans product does the same thing. We do consolidate loans, including credit card loans. So to some degree, it\u2019s not a new product. It had gotten a lot smaller as a category after the crisis, and to some degree, I think it\u2019s sort of returning to where it was before, but with maybe new players and new approaches. At the margin, it\u2019s got to have a little impact on the total card business receivables, but we haven\u2019t figured out a way to measure it at this point. We will be watching it. You know, there\u2019s origination fees. A personal loan is very different than a credit card that tends to be a small, temporary loan coming from spending usually. Credit card has a lot more features than a personal loan does. But a consolidation loan also has its place, and I guess for a couple of years now, we\u2019ve been, by far, the leader in this space, and now we\u2019ve got some company with a different funding model. Ken Bruce : And maybe also another follow up. Mark, you had mentioned that basically you are, from just a pure funding perspective, kind of positioned where you want to be. Are you at target duration on the liability side of the balance sheet now, and that it would just kind of match the general growth of the business? Or do you envision any changes, just given we keep pushing out the future rate hikes, and it feels like, as David\u2019s comments would suggest, things have softened up around the edges, so maybe we\u2019re looking at a lower rate environment maybe than you expected even three months ago? Mark Graf : I guess I can make you happy by saying we\u2019re never expecting a rapid ramp in rates. I mean, the activities we\u2019ve undertaken have always expected a pretty gradual movement. Now, from a risk management perspective, we run lots of shock scenarios to make sure we\u2019re protected. But what we\u2019ve been positioning ourselves for really is that principal case of a gradual rise in rates. So our thoughts around what\u2019s going to happen really hasn\u2019t shifted all that much in terms of timing or magnitudes. What I would say is the answer to your question about duration targeting, yeah, we\u2019re within a month or two of where ultimately, in a perfect world, I\u2019d like to see us be. So it feels like, again back to my earlier comment, we will do some fixed rate funding from here. It will be characterized in one of two different ways, either pure optimism, because we see, for lack of a better word, an arbitrage opportunity that makes a lot of sense, or number two, I would say it would be in response to shifts in the composition and growth in the balance sheet. So if we put more fixed rate assets on, you would expect to see us cover that with more fixed rate funding. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Valentin from FBR & Co. Scott Valentin : With regard to the personal loans, just curious kind of over the cycle, where you would see losses for that product versus the credit cards. David Nelms : You know, what I would rather do is defer to investor day on that. We have given that kind of guidance in previous investor days, and Bill\u2019s happy to give you those laying that out. But generally, personal loans, the way we underwrite them, probably have somewhat better loss characteristics than credit cards. It\u2019s very high FICO scores. Scott Valentin : In terms of the rewards programs, is there a cost benefit to the Miles program versus the cash back, on the rewards side? David Nelms : Yes, the Miles card is a bit more expensive from a rewards perspective. And we expect to see that offset by higher spending, higher balances, and engagement. So the way we look at it is we expect sort of similar overall returns, even though we also expect a higher rewards cost. Operator : And our next question comes from Cheryl Pate of Morgan Stanley. Cheryl Pate : Just a couple of follow up questions on the net interest margin, if I may. I guess first, on the credit card yield, I think you spoke to a bit of a mix shift more towards standard and promotional type balances. Just wondering if, on the promotional balances specifically, you can speak to the growth there, and has that been growing faster than other parts of the portfolio maybe, as we see some competition in the space? David Nelms : We\u2019ll give some more color on that at our investor day, but what I would say is the strongest growing portion of the book, by far, is the standard rate portion of the book. And I don\u2019t think by any stretch of the imagination we\u2019re being undisciplined with these promo balances or anything along those lines. The growth is really being driven by regular way usage of the card, which feels really solid. Cheryl Pate : And just a second follow up, if I might, on the personal loan side. You spoke to sort of consumer preference to shorter term loans from here. Has that been any change in pricing strategy or should we think of that as sort of getting ahead of rates? Is there any behavior in particular that\u2019s incenting that, or maybe the competitive environment, that might be fueling that? David Nelms : We\u2019ve looked at it from any number of different angles. We can\u2019t really discern any one particular thing, other than to say there\u2019s clearly been a shift in consumer preference, possibly as we\u2019ve gotten further away from the crisis, folks are feeling more confident in their financial situation, more confident in their employment situation, everything else. They\u2019re comfortable carrying a heavier payment and paying it down quicker. But we can\u2019t isolate and say definitively it\u2019s, gee, due to that, or due to something else. But that\u2019s kind of the operative thesis, for lack of a better way of putting it. Operator : And our next question comes from David Ho from Deutsche Bank. David Ho : Real quickly, back on the warehouse clubs, opening up acceptance to Visa cards, [unintelligible] volume out of the store, obviously those cards are more competitive versus yours, versus their previous provider. I know it\u2019s early days, and next year, but any potential impact in terms of wallet share as you think about some of the cash back offerings associated with the opening up of acceptance for those cards? David Nelms : No. Discover already has the highest acceptance in the top 100 retailers, and what I would expect, especially the way this is happening, is everyone already has multiple Visa cards. And so to some degree, they\u2019ll be able to put their spend on the same Visa card they already have, versus having to put it on a different card. So I don\u2019t see an impact on us. David Ho : And separately, what factors may you be considering in terms of what you plan to do with the direct mortgage business? And when do those expenses maybe come out a little bit more out of the cost structure? And then how are you thinking about the home equity installment loan side of the business as well? David Nelms : On the mortgage business, while we\u2019re pleased, as Mark indicated, that given the attractive environment this quarter, it was helpful. But we still are confident that the rate environment is going to move up, and therefore, refinance volume is going to decline. So we are continuing to look closely at options to make sure that it not become a drag over time. On the home equity business, it\u2019s just early days. We launched both personal loans and student loans in 1987, and we kept them pretty small until we felt really good about them, and then we started scaling them. I think we think the same way with home equity. We feel good about the business, but we\u2019re not to the point where we would feel like we\u2019re ready to ramp up to any significant degree. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Howlett with UBS. Matthew Howlett : Just on the card payment rates, I know they\u2019ve remained elevated from years past. And we looked at the master trust, I know that doesn\u2019t represent everything, but it appears to be picking up a bit year over year. Anything to say on that in terms of the guidance for loan growth? Do you expect sort of payment rates to remain in this range? Or how do you see consumer behavior changing? David Nelms : I expect it to be reasonably stable. It obviously can jump around a little bit from time to time, but I think the big story is credit is really good, and so that tends to correlate with relatively high payment rates. Matthew Howlett : So you expect them to be flattish? I know yours are sort of in the middle. You\u2019re not the highest, you\u2019re not the lowest. But sort of in this current range, do we see lower payment rates when credit eventually normalizes? Is that sort of what happens? David Nelms : Generally, it will move a little bit because of that. And if you think about us relative to others, we tend to focus a bit more on revolvers versus transactors, which tend to have lower payment rates on revolvers. So by definition, a transactor is 100% payment rate. And on the flipside, we tend to have better credit, which tends to drive higher payment rates. And so those two are kind of competing forces to get us to where we are. But I\u2019m not expecting a big trend in that number. Matthew Howlett : I know there\u2019s been a lot of questions on the card margin, but you mentioned the mix shift with some of the balance transfers coming in. Is that just a normalization? Is any of that being driven by competition? I know one of the big money center banks guided to the low end of their revenue margin for the year. Any pricing dynamics changing there, where more balance transfers could be introduced? Mark Graf : No, I would say the bigger dynamic is actually the replacement of the high rate bucket with standard rate product is actually a bigger driver at this point in time than the promotional activity itself. So we\u2019re tending to use the promotional activities more with the legacy portfolio as opposed to the new account side of the equation. And standard merchandise sales are really the big driver of that yield compression, sort of across both the new accounts and the portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark DeVries of Barclays. Mark DeVries : First question is around noninterest income. Just wondering, one, if you could give us an update on where your direct mortgage pipeline is shaping up for the quarter. And also, whether you can provide us an update on where you stand on relaunching your protection products. Mark Graf : On the second question, we have no current plans to relaunch protection products. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate. David Nelms : And on the mortgage pipeline, what I\u2019d tell you is we haven\u2019t traditionally disclosed our pipeline. I guess what I\u2019d say is what we have said is it tends to flip between accreting a penny and losing a penny a share a quarter, and I would just say it\u2019s going to be in that range again this next quarter, just based on everything I see right now. Mark DeVries : And then another question on your student lending credit. I think Mark, you indicated that it\u2019s seasoning as you expected, but both chargeoffs and delinquencies were down pretty substantially year over year. Is there anything to call out there? Are you seeing credit improve on that book? Mark Graf : I\u2019d say we were generally pleased with the numbers this quarter. That business, partly because of its size and maturity and seasonality, does tend to fluctuate a lot more quarter to quarter than our other businesses. One of the things that we have done is put in place some programs to help students who might be struggling. And we feel like we might be getting a little traction on some of those programs. That\u2019s good for both consumers and us. But I think we need a few more data points to see how material our immaterial those can be. David Nelms : The other thing I would just say is I think the employment market for graduates has continued to improve a bit. So I\u2019m certainly hopeful that that will portend good things for credit over the long term. Operator : And thank you. Our last question will come from Jason Arnold with RBC. Jason Arnold : Just another quick follow up on the airline rewards card side. I was just wondering if there\u2019s any way you can size the broader industry opportunity set in airline rewards, focused customers versus those that are more cash back or points reward focused. And then if you could comment on the incremental opportunity for growth that you mentioned for Discover, if that\u2019s more of a product of that balance of focus there, or if it\u2019s just your focus on cash back reward and its being incremental? David Nelms : By far, the largest airline rewards cards, as you know, are cobranded rewards cards for people that frequent a certain airline and are really heavy travelers. And that\u2019s a very sizable market. It\u2019s also one that there\u2019s some very significant cobrand payments associated with it. And I would say that\u2019s generally not what we\u2019re targeting with this product. I\u2019d say this product is targeting people that like the idea of earning travel rewards. They may travel some, but they\u2019re not the global travelers who are being reimbursed by their company or just traveling very extensively on business. So I would think about it as somewhat smaller market than either the traditional airline cobrand card or the traditional cash back category, which we are a leader in, and that will continue to be where our flagship card is. So I feel like this a bit more of an important niche and an important second product for us. Operator : We have no further questions. At this time, I will now turn the call over to Bill Franklin for final remarks. Bill Franklin : We\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us. If you have any other follow up questions, feel free to give us a call tonight. Have a good night.",

Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP David Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Discover Financial Services Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference to Mr. Bill Franklin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Bill Franklin - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Abigail. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin, as always, with slide two of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was furnished to the SEC in an 8-K report, and in our 10-K and 10-Q, which are on our website and on file with the SEC. In the second quarter 2015 earnings materials we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A period it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up, so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated. So now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Bill. Good evening everyone, and I want to thank you all for joining us today. For the second quarter we delivered net income of $599 million, earnings per share of $1.33, and a return on equity of 21%. Our net income this quarter benefited from a reserve release driven by a better outlook for our card credit. Card net charge-off and delinquency rates improved, as card members continue to be careful about managing their debt. And we continue to take action to help them stay current. At the same time consumer conservatism and lower gas prices have resulted in slow U.S. retail sales growth, and this along with heightened competition, has resulted in a bit slower growth for our card sales and loans. Despite these headwinds to sales we once again achieved another quarter of solid loan growth, building upon more than four years of quarterly card loan growth. Discover achieved total loan growth of 5% over the prior year, which was driven by growth in card loans, personal loans, and private student loans. Specifically we grew card receivables by 4%, in the middle of our targeted range. Card sales volume for the quarter was up 2%. Excluding the impact of gas prices, sales were up approximately 5%. Our loan growth continues to be driven by a combination of wallet share gains with new accounts and existing customers. Despite a competitive environment new account growth accelerated through the quarter, as we launched our double rewards offer to new Discover it customers. In addition to launching new rewards promotions in the quarter we also introduced new features for our card members. For example we launched our Freeze It capability, which essentially allows customers to turn on or off their card in the event that it is misplaced. Over 100,000 customers have tried this feature since launch. We also announced that our card members will be able to use Apple Pay and Android Pay in the near future. Our goal is to provide our customers the freedom, options, and simplicity of making mobile payments with whatever method they choose. Mobile payments and digital in all their forms will continue to be an opportunity to further engage with our card members, and we continue to invest in these capabilities. Turning to other direct lending products, the organic student loan portfolio increased 19% and personal loans grew 13% over the prior year. Both are on track for record originations in 2015, as we launch additional marketing programs with student loans during peak season, and as we see increased personal loan applications from the broad market. On the regulatory front this week the CFPB and the FDIC announced that they have released us from the protection products consent orders, which we entered into with them a few years ago. This morning we announced a consent order with the CFPB regarding certain student loan servicing practices. You may remember that we had previously disclosed a CID related to this matter early last year. And we fully accrued for this in the first quarter of 2015. Finally on the AML/BSA and general compliance fronts, we have noted significant expenses this quarter related to our continuing focus on meeting all regulatory expectations from our regulators. Focusing on payments, total volume was down 3% as increases in our proprietary volume and growth in our business-to-business volume were not enough to offset year-over-year declines at PULSE. The decreased volume at PULSE was mainly due to the previously announced loss of volume from a large debit issuer. On a reported basis Diners volume was roughly flat. However adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange rates, Diners volume was up more than 10% year-over-year, driven by strong results in several regions, especially Asia Pacific. Lastly, we rebalanced our portfolio of activities in the second quarter. In Direct Banking we announced the exit of our Home Loans business. In payments and specifically within Diners we announced the sale of our Diners Club Italy franchise to Corn\u00e8r's Bank (sic) [Corn\u00e8r Bank] (6:09) and announced a new Diners Club franchisee in Turkey. We are committed to our vision to be the leading direct bank and payments partner and continue to take steps towards achieving this vision. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark, and he will walk through the details of our second quarter results. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, David, and good evening everyone. I'll start by going through the revenue detail on slide five of our earnings presentation. Total company net revenues this quarter were roughly flat on a year-over-year basis, as higher net interest income was offset by lower fee income. Net interest income increased $47 million or 3% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth. Total non-interest income decreased $44 million to $539 million, driven primarily by lower net discount and interchange revenue and a decline in protection products revenue. Net discount and interchange revenue was down 9%, driven by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 105 basis points. On a reported basis, the rate was up 14 basis points year-over-year due to higher promotional rewards and the elimination of the rewards forfeiture reserve in the fourth quarter of 2014. Sequentially, the rate increased 3 basis points. In both cases, the increase was driven by higher enrollment and spend in our rotating 5% cashback category. Protection products revenue declined $10 million as new product sales remained suspended, consistent with prior quarters. Moving to Payment Services, revenue decreased $9 million from the prior year due to the previously announced loss of volume from a large debit issuer, which David referenced earlier. This loss is now largely reflected in the run rate going forward and will impact year-over-year comparisons for the next year. Turning to slide six, total loan yield of 11.35% was 7 basis points lower than the prior year, primarily driven by a 6 basis point decrease in card yield. The year-over-year decrease in card yield reflects a small shift in portfolio mix as high rate balances continue to be replaced by standard rate balances. Personal loan yield decreased from the prior year as more customers opt for shorter term consolidation loans, and we also instituted some select pricing changes. Funding costs increased 9 basis points as a result of actions taken in prior quarters to extend funding duration. In aggregate, these factors resulted in a 21 basis point decrease in net interest margin from the prior year to 9.63%, in line with our expectations. Turning to slide seven, operating expenses were up $130 million over the prior year, partially driven by higher regulatory and compliance costs. Employee compensation increased $25 million, due primarily to higher head count to support regulatory and compliance needs. Reported marketing expenses increased $31 million, $17 million of which was due to the discontinuation of a longstanding annual postage rebate that we typically received in the second quarter. Marketing expenses were also impacted by a shift in the timing of campaigns as compared to last year. Professional fees increased $41 million, due in part to approximately $20 million in fees associated with anti-money laundering remediation activities and another $10 million in compliance program enhancements. Other expense increased $29 million, driven by $23 million in one-time charges associated with the exit of our Home Loans business. We expect additional wind-down in restructuring expenses of approximately $25 million to $30 million in the second half of the year, and we currently expect a fourth quarter tax benefit related to exiting the business that will essentially offset these additional expenses. For the quarter, our total company efficiency ratio was 42.5%. Excluding the two unusual items I mentioned earlier, the total company efficiency ratio was roughly 40.5%. On an adjusted basis, this is higher than where we want to be in the long-term. With everything we now know, including the charges related to exiting Home Loans, the legal reserve that occurred in the first quarter, the loss of the postal rebate as well as a modest increase in our outlook for compliance-related costs, we expect our as-reported expenses to be approximately $3.6 billion for the full year versus our prior guidance of $3.5 billion. We continue to expect that operating expenses will decrease in 2016. Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on slide eight, provision for loan losses was lower by $54 million compared to the prior year due to a reserve release partially offset by higher charge-offs. This quarter, we reduced reserves by $41 million while last year we had a $23 million reserve build for the same period. This quarter's release was driven by a better credit outlook as overall card member health continues to improve, in part driven by lower gas prices and higher household cash flows. The credit card net charge-off rate decreased by 12 basis points from the prior quarter and by 5 basis points year-over-year to 2.28%. The 30-plus-day delinquency rate of 1.55% declined relative to both the prior quarter and the prior year, reaching a new record low. The private student loan net charge-off rate, excluding purchase loans, decreased 28 basis points from the prior year as we continue to benefit from more efficient collection strategies as well as the introduction of several new payment plans over the last year. Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, increased 12 basis points to 1.78%. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations. Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was up 15 basis points from the prior year and the over 30-day delinquency rate was up 5 basis points to 71 basis points. The year-over-year increase in the personal loan charge-off rate was primarily driven by the seasoning of loan growth. We had mentioned at our annual Financial Community Briefing in May that we were seeing the potential for credit to be better than we expected at the beginning of the year. We are now comfortable that the underlying financial health of our card members will indeed produce credit results better than we originally anticipated. While the book continues to season, we do expect our provision rate for the full year to be better than our prior expectations of 2.5% as the credit backdrop remains remarkably benign. One last item I'll call out on the income statement is that we were able to recognize some tax benefits which reduced our effective tax rate to 36.4% for the quarter. Looking forward, there may be some minor fluctuations quarter-to-quarter as we are able to favorably resolve other tax matters. To close things out, I'll touch on our capital position on slide nine. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio decreased sequentially by 30 basis points to 14.4% due to loan growth and capital deployment. During the quarter, we repurchased $425 million of common shares. In summary, the health of our card members continues to be strong, which will be a positive for our credit performance. This goodness will be largely offset on the expense line, which will be elevated as we continue to address regulatory matters and wind-down the mortgage business. The competitive environment continues to intensify while retail sales growth has been slower than expected. As the environment evolves, we will address both opportunities and risks that it presents with a continuing focus on driving long-term shareholder value. That concludes our formal remarks, so I'll turn the call back to our operator, Abigail, to open the line up for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks. I appreciate that the spending volume you had said was constrained by about 300 basis points and that your margin is still under pressure but you've kind of put a 9.5% kind of floor there. Could you talk a little bit about what steps you're taking, given all of the expenses that are building this year, to kind of improve profitability? Or do we just \u2013 I mean is it just that we kind of have to wait for those factors to abate? Could you just discuss your thoughts there? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Moshe, this is David. Some of the actions that we're taking now are designed to position us well for the future, even in some cases sacrificing near-term profitability. So the preparation for a rising rate environment on the funding side is costing us a bit of net revenue right now, but we think it's the right thing to do for long-term earnings growth. The exit of the Home Loans business will help our efficiency ratio going forward, and certainly we didn't see a path to producing adequate profitability in that business. And some of the marketing changes and cash rewards investments that we're making now are designed to drive growth and return long-term profitability. So it's focusing on long-term shareholder value, as Mark mentioned. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Moshe, all I'd really tack on to that is a big pressure right now is obviously on the expense front and its regulatory expenses. They were significant in the quarter. They continue to be a pressure point. We're committed to a constructive relationship with our regulators and making sure that we are operating in accordance with their expectations, but right now that's clearly a drag on profitability. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Right. So just to follow up, and maybe I was just a little too general in the question, is there a way that you could identify the effects of things that you expect to either abate or turn around in 2016, you're talking about the expenses on some of these compliance, the wind-down of the mortgage, perhaps if you would consider the costs of kind of preparing for the rising rate environment? I mean would you \u2013 is there a way to do that? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so let's talk about a couple of those specifically, Moshe, to really hit on the \u2013 very pointedly on your question. I would say let's take a look at the expense growth of $130 million, right? So $23 million of that is related to the exit of the Home Loans business, non-recurring; $17 million of it is related to the postal rebate that we have historically received kind of going away. Right? So that takes me down to an adjusted number. Then take out another $8 million for EMV costs that we incurred in the quarter, give or take. It takes me down to an adjusted $82 million. There's about, call it, another $40 million in various and sundry different regulatory related costs that are in there. That gets me down to an adjusted \u2013 rough math now, mind you, but for the sake of the call here \u2013 an adjusted expense growth number of $42 million as opposed to the headline number of $130 million. Right? So I think that's kind of a key piece of the puzzle to look at. If you talk about the funding side of the equation, I appreciate your earlier comment noting that the compression in NIM was kind of in line with our prior guidance. We did not take any further activities in this most recent quarter to further extend in any way our funding durations. So the compression you're seeing is a result of actions we've already taken to position the balance sheet. There's no more further pressure coming from that other than as the quarters roll and you get the comps with that higher funding cost in there, it will be there, and that's why we've given the guidance down to 9.5% going forward. So hopefully on the NIM side, hopefully on the expense side, that gives you some key pieces that will help you develop some comfort there. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks so much. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cheryl Pate with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Cheryl M. Pate - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. I just wanted to touch on loan growth for a moment and card loan growth in particular. Obviously we're still sort of towards the high-end of the range, but we've seen some deceleration in the past couple of quarters. Can you just speak to is that some selective pulling back from some customer segments? Is that increased competition? How should we think about that, and are we sort of at a stable level here or should we think about more to come? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well I think this quarter we moved back a bit to the middle of our range. And we cited the broad retail sales growth across the country that decelerated this quarter. And we saw that in many of our competitor announcements as well. We also saw the continuing impact of gas prices, which has impact sales and to a lesser degree loans. And I would acknowledge that it is more competitive now than it probably was a few years ago. We have been at the top end of our range and the top of the industry for now the last four years. And so while on the one hand we're still in the middle of our range, a lot of the actions we talked about are designed to try to accelerate that, because I'd rather find a way to get it back to the top of the range. And that includes the double cash rewards on our Discover it program, which has seen good results in the early weeks of that program, our new Miles program, additional marketing spend, additional features like the on/off functionality that's unique on our card. So we're taking a lot of actions to try to accelerate loan growth, but I'm pleased that we were in the middle of the range. Cheryl M. Pate - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Really helpful color. Thank you. I just wanted \u2013 and secondly on the personal lending I think you mentioned some change in the pricing strategy. Is that sort of related to some of the marketplace lending that's coming about? Or more to do with changing consumer preferences for term and shorter duration? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well we \u2013 I think it's pretty modest, that portion of it. The duration, average duration is the bigger part. But I mentioned that we're expecting all-time record loan originations this year. And so I think that we are looking to continue to grow that business, because it's \u2013 unlike some of the new competitors \u2013 we're quite profitable and we're growing. And we want to keep taking advantage of our capabilities in the prime segment within personal loans. Cheryl M. Pate - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Yeah thank you. I guess, David, you mentioned the heightened competition in the press release. And obviously we're seeing it in our mailboxes as well. Could you just talk about how different it is versus what you planned for at the beginning of this year? And kind of how it's affecting the financials going forward? I mean I notice the rewards cost edged up pretty significantly sequentially. So maybe you could just talk about how that's expected to trend going forward, Mark? Thanks. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well and I mentioned competition is just one factor. And I'm not sure it's so much different than what we planned for. It's just a factor that makes it harder to grow as fast as we'd like. I think that it's still \u2013 if you look at mailboxes there's still a lot less intensity than there was pre-crisis. But I \u2013 and there's fewer players here post-crisis left in the market. It's consolidated. But I think that some of the players that were really wounded from maybe credit mistakes and problems that they had made are kind of getting through those and are coming back in the market. And I think it's not lost on a lot of players that card returns are much higher than almost anything else in banking. And therefore it's an attractive place to compete. And so we are used to facing competition. We've done it for 30 years successfully. And so we view it as a challenge that we're up to. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I would say, Sanjay, just adding onto that the only thing I would say that has changed since the planning time is our expectations for overall retail sales growth. At the time we cut our plan last fall, Moody's, all the external providers, were basically expecting a much stronger retail sales growth climate than we're actually finding ourselves in today. So I would say that is the one major factor that has altered. In response to your specific question on rewards categories I would say this quarter the driver was active engagement enrollment and the 5% rotating cashback category was the principal driver. I think for the full year the guidance we gave is we expected the rewards rate to be in the 105 basis point range. I don't see any reason to point you to something radically different. If there is any upward pressure on rewards costs, I would say it's 1 basis point or 2 basis points above and beyond that possibly. But nothing of significant magnitude from a rewards standpoint there. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. And, Mark, could I ask one follow-up question? Just on the NIM and the tax rate, could you just drill-down a little bit? Like just if you could give us more a specific cadence there, that would be great. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So the NIM, I think last quarter we saw from first quarter \u2013 from fourth quarter into first quarter we saw 7 basis points of compression. And I think we guided on the last call that we expected to see similar compression this quarter, which would have taken us from 9.69% to 9.62% and we printed a 9.63%. So I feel like we're pretty much in line with the cadence we were kind of calling out. We do see further compression over the course of the remaining two quarters we're looking at going forward. But we still see ourselves remaining above a 9.5% NIM. I think if you want to use a linear approach to getting there, Sanjay, that's probably not a crazy way to think about modeling things I would say. And then on the tax rate scenario, I would say the good guide this quarter was simply related to a resolution of a tax matter with a taxing authority. And it was just kind of one of those things that you'll have from time-to-time as you get favorable resolutions to matters that you've reserved for. So kind of hard for me to kind of guide you in terms of what that looks like going forward for when we might see other such things. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay great. Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel. Your line is open. Chris C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I'm going to focus on the competitive environment for a second, Mark. We talked about some of the higher spending customers may be getting poached away by some of the aggressive rewards offers out there. I just want to see from a strategic standpoint, is that getting worse or is it sort of stabilizing, especially if you think about some of the increased efforts you've made on the rewards side both in this quarter's results and also the double promotional points on it. Are you targeting to get back to the kind of growth you were experiencing in purchase volumes sort of more in line with the industry, or are you okay letting some of this business go? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I would say that our objective is to get sales growing a little faster. It was \u2013 ex gas it was 5%, and as we get to the end of the fourth quarter, that's when I would expect the gas thing to stop being something we talk so much about, because it'll be in the end-of-the-year comps. But 5% ex gas is still above retail sales growth, but if we can find ways to get that even higher than that, above retail sales growth, we will take actions to do so. And certainly some of our new rewards programs, marketing and so on are designed to do that. The one thing is we're not going to \u2013 we are focused on sustainability. We're not going to be entering an arms war. Chris C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. Just from a strategic standpoint, David, is it fair to say at this point in the cycle that the majority of your revenue growth will come from some of the other products rather than card, or is card still going to be the engine for growth here? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Both are going to be engines for growth. The card is going to be quite important because of its base size. The other products are going to tend to grow faster than card but from a lower base. So as we look out over the next year, the next three years, we need to maximize our profitable growth in all of our products. Chris C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. I look forward to that. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Your line is open. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): David, as the Fed looks like it's about to potentially raise rates, how are you \u2013 how do you think the card industry is going to react in terms of card yields? Do you expect a sort of full 100 basis point asset beta, or do you think some of the competitors might actually create a stickier yield to where that doesn't necessarily get passed through knowing they're all floating rate loans? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. I mean, post-CARD Act, as far as I know, all cards are variable rate and so we'll immediately reset upward. I think if you just focus narrowly on new account pricing, it might not be a perfect beta. But I would expect those rates to also go up, and it would certainly take a number of years for that to really filter into the portfolio. So I think that it'll immediately adjust up. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is open. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Yeah, thanks very much. In your prepared remarks, you guys talked about I think it was somewhat tied that you're seeing the customers still reticent to spend much, to maybe lever up a little bit, and at the same time you're seeing improved near-term credit outlook because delinquencies and loss trends. If those are tied together at this point, are you \u2013 is it possible that there's been a permanent shift or at least an intermediate term shift in customer trends? And if so, does that change long term expectations for both credit and loan growth opportunities? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think that \u2013 I guess I would answer that as yes. We've already seen that, and I don't think it's going to go back to pre-crisis. We're not counting on huge loan growth in our industry in cards, but we also think that the new normal for credit is significantly different than pre-crisis. I think that consumer behavior has had a certain amount of permanent change as well as some of what competitors are willing to offer. You just don't see a lot of subprime players the way it existed in the past. And so the good news is that the industry is \u2013 feels like it's going to start returning to slow growth, and that's a lot different than the shrinkage we've seen for a number of years. And even as it does that, credit remains amazingly benign. And for us to achieve actual reduction in charge-off and delinquencies despite our loan growth this quarter, this far away from the crisis I think is remarkable. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : And as a little follow on to that, would that, over time, maybe give you an opportunity to go a little down market, you know, even if you did it very carefully just because it's possible that there's some increased demographic you could approach given the better outlook for overall credit? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let me parse it two ways. Right now, the players who are in retailer and subprime kind of credit are seeing a pretty big resurgence in growth. But it's not a market that I'm particularly focused on. We're just not a subprime player. Now, at the same time, as credit and behavior gets worked into the models and given customers have lower risk, it opens up the universe a bit of people that could have prime performance, that maybe in the past we might not have been as confident that they would have had prime performance. So at the margin, we are looking for opportunities to expand our prime universe, particularly both in cards and personal loans. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Great. That's very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Mark, thank you for the stratification of the drivers of the increased costs in the period. Just to focus in on that $40 million of regulatory costs, did that include both the personnel related component as well as the professional fee component? Or was it just one or the other? And I guess what I'm really trying to get to is what part of it is going to be sort of sustainable and recurring and what part of it can diminish? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Absolutely. So let me kind of give you how I'm getting to that rough $40 million number ballpark, and again these are rough numbers. They're not sniper rifle estimates. So you've got about $20 million directly related to the look-back that's been mandated in our regulatory consents. There was about another $5 million in, what I will call, general compliance type activity. There's about $5 million expense related to our information technology group and work they needed to do related to certain compliance related activities. And then there's about $10 million in, what I would call, non-volume head count that has come into the model over the course of the last year directly \u2013 it's really more second and third order effects. So you don't see these people sitting in compliance, you don't see these people sitting in corporate risk, but the people in compliance and corporate risk are looking for more information, more reporting, more activity. So that's driving second and third order effects downstream. I'm, for my purposes, classifying that as, what I'll call, regulatory compliance related activity as well. So if you look about the \u2013 if you look at it net-net, certainly 50% of that increase is non-recurring beyond this year as we get through that look-back type activities. I think we'd all be hopeful that we'd have the ability to pare back some portion of that additional 50% as we get this activity layered in. The head count is not coming out, which was $10 million of it, and I'm sure there will be some ongoing related activity as well. So I don't have the precise number to give you. Clearly, 50% of it is non-recurring. I'm comfortable saying that some portion of the remainder is non-recurring. What I can't do is give you a real sniper rifle estimate on what the tail on that looks like. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. Very helpful. Thanks very much. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is open. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Mark, I was hoping I could get you to be a little bit more specific on the revised guidance around the provision. I think you indicated you expect it to be better than the 2.5% prior guidance, but given how low the first half run rate is, you could technically be above that run rate in the second half and still meet your guidance, but that certainly doesn't seem reasonable given that credit still remains really benign. Is there any kind of specifics you can give us on what you think the provision rate might look like? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Very fair question. I would say, Mark, at this point in time, that's one of the things we're trying to get behind ourselves as we kind of see this new normal credit environment creeping in that's offsetting the seasoning. So I'm not prepared at this point in time to give you a new provision rate, but I would kind of highlight one of the things that I pointed out in our prepared remarks when I kind of said we're going to have this increased level of expenses rounding from $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion because of some of these additional things that have come at us. But we do expect the goodness on the credit side relative to that provision guidance will pay for that. Right? So comfortable going that far at this point in time. Beyond that, we need to see a little bit more history, a little bit more activity to get a better sense on that front. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. But are you seeing anything in the data right now that would suggest a materially higher run rate in the second half of the year relative to where we've been in the first half of the year? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We're continuing to see the book season, which is the key piece of the puzzle. The fundamental question is really on the consumer behavior side of the equation that I don't think we have enough history with yet to really be able to sniper rifle \u2013 give you a sniper rifle estimate on that. So again, I just \u2013 I don't want to give you guidance that I'm not comfortable with myself yet because we don't have all the ticking and tying done ourselves. I am comfortable telling you it's going to better than that 2.5%. I'm comfortable saying it'll pay for the expense increase. That goodness will pay for the increased expense guidance. Is there possibility it could be more than that? Yes, there's clearly a possibility it could be more than that but I need to get a little more facts on my side because I don't want to mislead you. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, got it. Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good evening, guys. I guess on my first question, Mark, you noted in the prepared remarks on efficiency that you weren't happy with the level at which you were at, and you walked through some of the math. But I guess my question is as you think ahead to 2016, do you think the 38% efficiency target is achievable, given all the moving parts on expenses? Clearly, we don't know what the rate environment is going to look like, which could help the overall run rate, but I was just interested in what your early thoughts are on that looking ahead? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Ryan, I would kind of say it's a long term target that we want to hit and that we try to run the business model at. It's too early for me to give you guidance in next year in terms of where I think it's really going to come out, because there's going to be some \u2013 obviously some puts and takes as we go through our strategic planning process and our budgeting process for the year as well where we'll look to take some expenses out of the model. I think we'll probably look to make some growth investments and I just don't know how all those are going to shake out at this point in time. I'm very confident telling you that, as a management team, we're not happy with an adjusted efficiency ratio with a 40% tag associated with it. I'm very confident that a significant chunk of the expenses in the model right now are non-recurring. But in terms of giving you guidance on exactly how close we're going to be to that 38%, either up above or below it, it's just too early for me to give you that. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And just maybe one follow-up financial question. I just wanted to make sure I fully understood the net interest margin outlook. Was that for the rest of this year or through 2016? And you made a comment earlier about some of the higher rates in the loan book are being replaced by standard rates. How far through the repricing process? Does it feel like we're getting close to the end on that? And how much of an impact is that actually having on the overall net interest margin? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I would say a couple things, Ryan. The net interest margin guidance I said \u2013 I think what we said is it'll stay above 9.5% at least through the end of 2016. So that's one where we have gone out a little bit further on our guidance at this point in time, and I'm comfortable really kind of saying I feel comfortable with that at this juncture. In terms of the impact of the remixing of the portfolio and the impact to that, I would say in a post-CARD Act environment, the only balances you get to reprice up \u2013 or you get to price up are balances \u2013 new balances created after such point in time as that customer goes 60 days delinquent. So you obviously don't refill that higher rate bucket very much. So I think you'll see continued movement out of that promotional category \u2013 or out of the high rate bucket rather \u2013 into the standard rate category. And that is a big factor in the driving of the margin compression candidly down to that 9.5% level. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks for taking my question. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You betcha. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is open. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Mark, on the double rewards I don't believe you guys are making those rewards available to customers until they've been with you for a year. But is the cost of those double rewards hitting the rewards expense line now? Or is that going to come later? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. That's being accrued in the rewards expense line. You got to accrue that on the fly. So we are handling that accrual, and it is in the numbers you see. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. So earlier you had mentioned that one of the things that drove the rewards higher this quarter was the 5% cash back category. But that would \u2013 another factor would be the double rewards contributing to the higher rewards expense this quarter? Is that correct? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I would say that's absolutely mathematically correct. I would tell you it's a relatively small number, because it's really spending only related to new accounts. Right? So you got the installed base is one issue, but then you got the new account activity that's qualifying for it as well. So I would say the driver is clearly not the double. The driver was clearly where the 5% category was this quarter. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scott J. Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Thanks very much for taking my question. With regard to the student loan, the settlement I guess, or the fine the CFPB announced, is that going to have any material impact on servicing expense of student loans going forward or the profitability of the student loans going forward? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. It related to some practices that we actually changed a while back, so everything is in the run rate. Scott J. Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. And then just a follow-up question on M&A. In the past you've mentioned you look at adjacent kind of businesses to consumer lending. And just wondering if you continue to look? And maybe what areas you're looking in? Or what areas you see as interesting right now? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I would say in terms of the areas where we would look, those would be the areas we would generally look. We obviously don't give any specific thoughts on M&A type related matters, other than at this point in time I would say we've gone on the record and said while we're under a BSA/AML consent order, it's unlikely we would look to M&A type activities. I think we kind of feel we have to get that one rectified. But I think in terms of generally where we would devote our attentions, yeah, I think natural adjacencies where we can lever strengths we have internally, as opposed to trying to take quantum leaps and say entering the commercial real estate lending business or something. That doesn't feel like our DNA. Scott J. Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. All right, thanks very much. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good evening guys. I just want to get a sense of how you measure the payback for some of these new card features. Does it really lower the cost of acquisition for new customers? Or maybe change the revolving (44:00) or spend patterns relative to some of the legacy cards? And then going forward as you lap some of these expense headwinds, you mentioned perhaps a little more incremental investment. Is that the case? Do you expect to see additional opportunities in 2016 to really deploy? And kind of where do you think the best dollars would be most efficiently used there? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, David, I'll handle the first half and have Mark handle your second question. We look carefully at the net present value expected from all of our accounts. And then we \u2013 when we make changes, we run those through. And we try it and we test. And we work to maximize the long-term profitability of any action we take. Certainly one of those actions and some of our actions do help our cost per account. And even though we've mentioned heightened competition a couple times on this call, you normally would see all other things equal that that would show up as higher acquisition costs, and we have not seen that at this point. We've actually seen slightly lower average cost per account in our card business this year than in the past. And that's partly because of the marketing and feature functionality that we've taken. We also see \u2013 when we see different performance in some of our products like our extension into Discover it Miles has significantly higher average sales volume per new account. That comes back into the P&L. And for those accounts we could actually afford to pay a little more if we're going to get more over the long term. So we look at every activity with its own P&L. And, Mark, maybe you can hit on the second question on capital buyback? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Oh absolutely. Yeah, so on the buyback activity, what I would say is we continue to be very focused on producing high yield. I think we got close to a 9% total yield right now between dividends and buybacks. We clearly recognize we have too much capital at this point in time and within the constraints of the regulatory process and the CCAR process, we are very focused on finding ways to return that capital to shareholders. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : David, was there anything else on capital? David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Well, I was actually more focusing on kind of where you think the best marketing opportunities would be in 2016. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Oh, for deployment. I'm sorry. I misunderstood the question. My apologies, David. So in terms of the best opportunities for deploying it, I think you see us making a lot of those investments today in the it platform right now would be one key piece of the puzzle I would say is a good place for deploying that capital. We continue to, as David noted earlier, to see great CPAs and very active, engaged card member behavior there. I think there's a lot of investments going into digital right now, digital and mobile platforms. Our key focus on the information technology side and investments being made there very heavily. I think in the non-card lending businesses, the direct banking businesses, I think digital investments there are also forefront critical and are consuming capital at this point in time and we're seeing good returns associated with those. And I think you already know we're actively engaged in migrating all of our banking platform products to a new core banking system as well. So that's a driver also. So we watch the expected payback and the budgets associated with all these projects very, very closely, and I'm comfortable that we continue to have a disciplined process around the investments we're making. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open. Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon. Just on the \u2013 so I wasn't clear on the postage rebate, the $17 million. Is that a quarterly or an annual number, that rebate that you were getting? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It was an annual number, Bob, that tended to generally fall into the second quarter. It was $17 million last year. So the increase this year is pulling up that comp. It varied year-to-year, but last year it was $17 million and this year the postal service chose to not renew that rebate. So it's a once-a-year kind of thing. It'll adjust this year, and then it will be out of the run rate going forward. Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then as we look at the marketing spend in the back half of the year kind of the similar trend to what we've seen like, say, last year, the ramp-up from \u2013 I mean, you wouldn't have the same ramp-up I guess because of the $17 million, but the same general trend in the back half of the year. You're not expecting any change in marketing trend? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. I actually think the marketing expense kind of hit its high watermark this quarter for the year. We'll actually \u2013 I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had some timing differences in campaigns. So I think you've seen the marketing expense hit its high watermark over the course of the year. It'll down a little bit from here, although it'll be higher in the fourth quarter than the third. Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Are you seeing anything alarming in the student loan portfolio? Student loan player had brought \u2013 had some issues on the credit side with a certain portfolio that was going back into payment. Have you seen anything alarming in your student loan portfolio from a credit perspective? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, we haven't. Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just last question, Ariba, is that going to be a material business, the B2B business? And over what timeframe could it become material? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think in the short- and medium-term, it could become material volume, we hope. I think I would not expect material profitability or revenues any time soon, it is B2B. It's low margin, but it's a huge market. And so, over the long period of time, we hope to build some very large significant volumes and there may be the potential for some ancillary related services that could also be profitable. Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Have you been adding new corporations to that business? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: I know you signed one very large partner. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We have been adding additional participants. Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. Appreciate it. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Sure. I wanted to ask one question around the credit quality and I understand it's better than you'd expected. As we look at the master trust data in your early stage delinquencies, I see that in that bucket delinquency rates around 40 basis points, historically low by your standards. Should we still be, though, thinking about your broader portfolio, so not just the master trust subset, as reflecting something a little different than that? Because I have trouble making the math work to go from like 40 basis points early stage delinquencies to the kind of provision you're talking about. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So I would say there is \u2013 Chris, there is a discrepancy between the master trust and the managed book. So if you think about the master book, I think we're coming up on or have just lapped six years since we have added any new accounts to that. So it's a very well-seasoned book. And one of the things you'll see in a well-seasoned book is on a like-for-like basis, so if you have a FICO score \u2013 just pick a random number \u2013 a 750 FICO account that's brand-new and a 750 FICO account that's been with you for 10 years, the 750 that's been with you for 10 years performs better. I don't think that's unique to Discover. I think that's just a phenomena you see in the consumer lending space. So there definitely is a disconnect between the performance of a well-seasoned book and the seasoning of a newly acquired book that you put on there. So absolutely there is a disconnect there. That's why we give you some of the managed data as well along with those master trust releases on a monthly basis so that you can kind of get a little bit of insight into there. Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Got it. Okay. And then separately here, just thinking about reward spending and your quarterly promotions there, this quarter you've got one with Amazon and I think a couple years ago when you did a promotion with Amazon and maybe a broader mix of online merchants around the fourth quarter, you had an elevated rewards level. Anyway, any early reaction to having Amazon in the mix for about three weeks here? It seems like it interacts very well with your customer base. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It interacts very well with the customer base. We have a great relationship with that firm as well. I guess what I would say is that fourth quarter from a few years back was the result of a very broad category. This is targeted specifically at Amazon, and no, I'm not concerned about a repeat of that event from several years ago. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Amazon and home improvement. Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Correct. Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Got it. Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Hochstim with Buckingham Research. Your line is open. David Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks. I had a question, sort of a follow up to the comments David made earlier about competition and consumer behavior. I wonder at the margin, given your very high returns and very low charge-off and delinquency rate, is it possible to, I guess, modify your credit standards slightly and increase growth, or is there just a sharp drop-off in the behavior of customers? And as Mark, you just mentioned, you do a lot better with seasoned customers than new customers. I guess I wonder what the tradeoff's like and if you can update us on the mix, how much of the portfolio today at the end of the second quarter is relatively new and how much is older. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think we had an earlier question kind of on that. I think at the margin, I do think there is some opportunity to take a little more risk to get a little more growth to increase profitability. And in some cases, it's really taking the same risk, but we're basically being able to expand the credit bucket a bit given the confidence that some of those consumer behavioral change that has occurred is here for an extended period of time. The only thing I would say is I wouldn't take the leap that we're going to suddenly do giant line increases to drive a huge amount of growth, because that will usually come back and bite you. We're not going to just jump into subprime to accelerate growth. So I would just emphasize modest and at the margin, and we're always looking for opportunities. David Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And how much of the portfolio are the two accounts that are more than, let's say, three years old at this point or two years old? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Our average customer has been with us for 12 years, which is we believe the highest in the industry. It's one of the reasons our credit is so good. Our focus on service as well as having great credit quality helped with that. About 17% of our book is three years or less of age. David Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Harbes with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Good evening. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good evening. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just quick question on the recent decision to exit the direct mortgage business. You called out some of the charges you took this quarter as well as some additional charges in the back half. It sounds like those will be offset by a tax benefit. But just for modeling purposes, what was the amount of fee income you booked from that business, and any associated expenses that presumably will roll-off over the course of the next six months or so? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so I'll point you back to some other places to kind of compose it. So in terms of revenues, we've published mortgage revenue in the 10-Qs historically, and it was roughly plus or minus $80 million on an annual basis, give or take. And then I would say the other thing I'd point you toward is we kind of said that the business was roughly operating at a break-even level. So I think that kind of gets you to sort of how to adjust your model as you're looking into 2016, more or less. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe just a follow up on Diners Club, maybe just an update on what your expectations are for that business? I think typically you see some favorable seasonality in the fee income line from Diners. I just wanted to get an update. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. I think we don't \u2013 I think you could look back at previous seasonality where it's typically the revenue's front-end loaded in the first quarter, and we don't really see that changing. I guess the thing I feel good about on Diners is we've had to take a lot of actions to get stronger franchises in certain markets, to deal with Citi exiting in certain markets that they were in to deal with the economy in Europe, and it feels like we're on a much more level to growing field. We're back in the double-digit growth on volume. We're seeing some very nice volumes out of our Chinese, Indian, and certain other franchises, Japanese is growing nicely. And we've gotten \u2013 we had to step in there at the Italian situation. We've now got a buyer, so we're back into just operating the network everywhere once we close that. So Diners is still a relatively small part of the overall profit picture, but nonetheless it feels like a much more positive trajectory. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, guys. Operator : I'd like to turn the call back to Bill Franklin for further remarks Bill Franklin - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Abigail. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us late this evening. If you have any follow up questions, feel free to give the IR team a call. Have a good night. Thank you, all. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Discover Financial Services Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Bill Franklin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference, sir. Bill Franklin - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Michelle. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin, as always, with slide two of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC today in an 8-K report, and in our 10-K and 10-Q, which are on our website and on file with the SEC. In the third quarter 2015 earnings materials we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Our call today will include formal remarks from Roger Hochschild, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A period, it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up, so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated. So now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : Thanks, Bill. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Unfortunately David had a conflict and is unable to join us. I'll be standing in for him this evening, but you'll see David again soon at the Bank of America Conference on November 18. For the third quarter, we delivered net income of $612 million, earnings per share of $1.38, and a return on equity of 22%. Our net income this quarter benefited from a continued favorable credit environment, resulting in record low card and total company net charge-off rates. We reported 2.6% card sales growth over the prior year. However, our sales, excluding gas, increased 7% as card member gas purchases were down over 30% in the quarter. We believe this period had the largest impact from gas sales as the comparison to last year gets slightly easier in the fourth quarter. Despite these headwinds to sales, we once again achieved another quarter of solid loan growth. Specifically, we grew card receivables by 4%, in the middle of our targeted range. We'd like to see this accelerate and are taking a disciplined profitable approach to drive new accounts and loan growth going forward. To that end, we achieved the highest quarterly level of new accounts since the third quarter of 2007 despite the heightened competitive environment. As we continue to focus on driving more new accounts and increasing wallet share with existing customers, we extended our promotional double rewards program for new accounts, and we introduced a new Apple Pay promotion to help drive mobile wallet adoption. And we had some big news this quarter. We were ranked the highest for customer satisfaction with credit card companies in the 2015 J.D. Power survey for credit cards. This was the culmination of years of effort in every aspect of the customer experience, and I want to acknowledge the hard work of our nearly 15,000 employees. Turning to other direct lending products, our organic private student loan portfolio increased 17% and personal loans grew 12% over the prior year. Both are on track for record originations in 2015, as we had a strong peak season in student loans and are seeing increased personal loan applications from the broad market. Focusing on payments, total volume was down 3% as increases in our proprietary volume and growth in our business-to-business volume were not enough to offset year-over-year declines at PULSE. The decrease in volume at PULSE was mainly due to the previously announced loss of volume from a large debit issuer. On a reported basis, Diners volume was down 3%. However, adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange rates, Diners volume was up more than 10% year-over-year, driven by strong results in several regions, especially Asia Pacific. On October 1, we completed the sale of our Diners Club Italy franchise to Corn\u00e8r Bank. As we previously indicated, we do not plan to be the long-term owner of the business, and we look forward to working with our new partner going forward. In other global payments activities during the quarter, we signed several new agreements including a new net-to-net partnership with Elo, the largest Brazilian credit card brand. All-in-all it was a good quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark and he'll walk through the details of our third quarter results. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Roger, and good evening, everyone. I'll start by going through the revenue detail on slide five of our earnings presentation. Total company net revenues this quarter were roughly flat on a year-over-year basis as higher net interest income was offset by lower fee income. Net interest income increased $47 million, or 3% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth. Total noninterest income decreased $49 million to $503 million, driven primarily by runoff in mortgage origination and protection products revenue. Net discount and interchange revenue was down 2%, driven by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 107 basis points. As reported, the rate was up 5 basis points year-over-year, due primarily to the elimination of the rewards forfeiture reserve in the fourth quarter of 2014. Sequentially, the rate increased 2 basis points driven by promotional programs. As we've said before, we do expect some continued pressure on the rewards front, as it remains the locus of competitive intensity in the card space. Our current view is that the fourth quarter rewards rate will be in the neighborhood of 115 basis points. Protection products revenue declined $16 million year-over-year as new product sales remain suspended, as they have been since the fourth quarter of 2012. Other income was down $21 million, largely driven by the decline in mortgage origination revenue as we exit the product. Looking to the coming quarters, we expect this combination of factors will continue to produce lower year-over-year non-interchange fee income. However, it's important to keep in mind that exiting Home Loan originations will be beneficial to the bottom line once shutdown costs are behind us, as operating expenses exceeded revenues in this business for the last year. Moving to payment services, revenue decreased $9 million in the prior year due to the previously announced loss of volume from a large debit issuer. This loss will continue to impact year-over-year comparisons through the first quarter of 2016. Turning to slide six, total loan yield of 11.37% was one basis point higher year-over-year. In terms of the components, credit card yield declined 1 basis point, while student loan yields increased 6 basis points. Personal loan yields moved the most, decreasing 13 basis points from the prior year as a result of customers continuing to opt for shorter term loans, which price further down the curve and the effects of some select pricing changes we instituted earlier in the year. On the other side of the ledger, funding costs increased 8 basis points on liabilities due to funding mix and higher rates. The higher funding costs continued to be the primary driver behind the decrease in net interest margin from the prior year to 9.62%. Sequentially net interest margin declined 1 basis point, a bit better than we expected due to slightly less promotional balance activity and better credit. Our current view is for NIM to end the year at roughly the same level as the third quarter. Turning to slide seven, operating expenses were up $55 million over the prior year, driven primarily by one-time and ongoing compliance costs. Employee compensation increased $17 million due primarily to higher head count to support regulatory and compliance activities. Marketing expenses decreased $14 million due to the timing of spend within the year. Professional fees increased $49 million due in part to approximately $28 million in look-back related anti-money laundering expenses, as well as higher costs associated with technology and compliance investments. For the quarter, our total company efficiency ratio was about 40%, slightly higher than our 38% target, as it continued to be impacted by several extraordinary items we've discussed throughout 2015. Even at this elevated level, we remain among the most efficient large banks in the U.S. However, since we don't expect these extraordinary costs to recur in 2016, we provided an adjusted operating efficiency ratio to better reflect the efficiency of our core business. This ratio excludes $28 million in anti-money laundering look-back expenses for the quarter and $23 million in expenses for the quarter, associate with the wind down and exit of our Home Loans business. Adjusting for these items, the efficiency ratio was about 38%, essentially in line with our long-term target, although I'll point out that our efficiency ratio tends to be a bit lower in the first and third quarters. We still believe reported operating expenses will be right about $3.6 billion for 2015. Turning to slide eight, provision for loan losses was lower by $22 million, compared to the prior year, due to a smaller reserve build. This quarter we built reserves by $8 million. We recorded a $30 million build in the same period last year. This quarter's build was driven by card loan growth, partially offset by a reserve release in student loans. The credit card net charge-off rate decreased by 24 basis points from the prior quarter and by 12 basis points year-over-year to 2.04%. The 30-plus delinquency rate of 1.65% increased 10 basis points sequentially and declined 6 basis points relative to the prior year. The private student loan net charge-off rate, excluding purchased loans, decreased 20 basis points from the prior year, as we continue to benefit from more efficient collection strategies as well as the introduction of several new payment plans over the last year. Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding purchased loans, increased 10 basis points to 1.88%. Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was up 7 basis points from the prior year, and the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 5 basis points to 80 basis points. The year-over-year increase in the personal loan charge-off rate was primarily driven by the seasoning of loan growth. To close things out, I'll touch on our capital position on slide nine. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio decreased sequentially by 10 basis points to 14.3% due to loan growth and capital deployment. During the quarter, we repurchased $435 million of common stock, or nearly 2% of our outstanding shares. We continue to believe that on a combined basis our buybacks and dividends are driving the highest total yield among CCAR participants. In summary, expenses have been and will continue to be elevated in 2015 as a result of some items we don't expect to recur next year. However, on a core basis, we are operating roughly in line with our long-term efficiency ratio target. Delivering strong credit performance has helped offset some of the higher expenses, and the credit environment continues to feel relatively benign. As we close out 2015 and plan for 2016, we'll continue to focus on driving long-term value for our shareholders as we grow our business. That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Michelle, to open the line up for Q&A. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. I guess my first question is just on loan growth. You guys talked about wanting to accelerate the growth rate but remaining disciplined in the competitive environment. Could you talk about how that affects your growth outlook into next year and also the rewards rate? I've got one follow-up after that. Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : Sure, Sanjay. As you look across the products, let me start with student loans and personal loans. We're seeing very strong growth and are on track for record levels of originations. On the card side, growth is still within our range, but we are seeing an impact from sales and a lot of it coming from gas sales, but are continuing to invest, and I'm excited to see the level of new accounts and how well Discover it and the new features and innovation we're bringing to market, how well that's doing. So I think that's a positive sign. Keep in mind, though, that a lot of our balances with new accounts are built through sales as opposed to balance transfer, so it takes a bit of time for those new accounts to translate into overall loan growth. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Sanjay, just in terms of your rewards rate, what I would say is the expectation for the fourth quarter, as we noted in our prepared remarks, is 115 basis points. As we look to 2016, I'm not prepared to give specific guidance yet. What I will say is, I think on a full-year basis, it's likely to be higher than what you've seen in 2015, but we fully intend on remaining disciplined in terms of how we spend those dollars. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. I guess my follow-up question is on the BSA/AML overhang. At what point do you think you're not affected by them? And how do you think you can benefit from that, outside of lower expenses? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'll cover the overhang and when I think it goes away, and then I'll let Roger talk about the business benefits. So what we have guided folks toward is that the expenses related to the look-back requirements of the AML/BSA situation would be about $75 million on the full year this year. There's about $28 million roughly in the quarter this year. Currently, I think that the look-back expense is likely to come in more on the order of about $85 million in total. We will cover that additional $10 million through other operating efficiencies, so not changing our overall expense guidance. I do believe we'll be completed with the look-back this year. I feel comfortable with that. What I would say is there will be ongoing compliance costs that will be in the model, Sanjay, going forward, but we are essentially covering those costs with efficiencies elsewhere in the operating model. And, Roger, I'll let you speak to the other element. Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, and, Sanjay, in terms of overall business benefits, I wouldn't expect anything significant. I think it's a nice complement in terms of the new models. It's a complement to what we're already doing in terms of fraud prevention. But I wouldn't expect to see a material improvement in the fraud rate from these new investments. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: And as far as deploying excess capital? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I think the deployment of excess capital, Sanjay, I assume what you're alluding to is inorganic opportunities to deploy that excess capital. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Right. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think that will depend upon the lifting of the AML/BSA consent order or at least significant progress toward that end on our part. It's hard for me to handicap that one for you because I feel good about the progress we're making. But we have more ground to cover in terms of where we need to go, and there's a regulator who will ultimately control \u2013 a series of regulators who will control when it's lifted, so it's hard for me to handicap for you. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. On the marketing spend and the number of new accounts, I mean you said there was timing on the marketing being a little lower, so I would imagine you're looking for an uplift in the fourth quarter? But you also said you put on a record number of new accounts. What is the quality level of those new accounts? And where are they coming from? How are you hitting a record level of new accounts with less marketing? Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : So in terms of the record level of new accounts with less marketing, sometimes there's a bit of a lag. And so we did talk about the second quarter being our probably top tick in terms of marketing expense for the year, and so that translates into bookings in the following quarter. In terms of quality, we are very pleased with the quality we're seeing. We have not made any significant changes in terms of our credit criteria. We're seeing very strong activation rate, more retail sales with less of an emphasis on balance transfer and attractive costs per account. So we're very excited about the quality of the new accounts we're booking. Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: So that by definition should lead to an acceleration in loan and spending growth were that to continue ... Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : So there are a lot of factors that go into overall loan and sales growth. Certainly what happens in \u2013 with gas prices has shown us all what can impact. And clearly overall retail sales, the holiday season, the other efforts we do stimulating our portfolio, those all add up. But I would say it's a positive indicator in terms of how well our product is competing in a very competitive marketplace. Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is open. Please go ahead. William Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask on credit, the provision as a percentage of average loans appears to be in that sub-2% range, well below the 2.5% that you guys guided to earlier in the year. And I think at the time you guys gave that guidance, you might have been closer to 2.3%. And so given the kind of growth that we're seeing, are you guys likely to stay \u2013 is it reasonable to expect that you stay in that kind of 2% level? Can you maybe just give a little bit of perspective around that looking ahead to 2016? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yep, happy to do it, Mr. Carcache. So year-to-date, the provision rate, as you noted, is around 2% give or take. And on last quarter's call, we said it would be lower than our original 2.5% guidance for the year. I think that's pretty much a given at this point in time. We see continued benign credit markets out there generally. So while I'm not prepared to speak to 2016 at this point in time in terms of exactly what our expectations are, I think it's definitely a foregone conclusion that we will be well inside of that 2.5% at this point in time based on everything I see right now this year. Credit continues to feel exceptionally benign, and it's a good environment from that perspective. William Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is on the other income line. Can you help us think through a little bit more specifically some of the moving parts there? Perhaps if possible, breaking down for us how much runoff and mortgage origination revenues and payment protection contributed to the decline and the rate at which those will attrite going forward? Just trying to get a sense of what the other income line, you know, could look like in 2016. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so mortgage revenues were roughly $17 million lower give or take; something on that neck of the woods. Protection product revenues were lower by roughly $6 million give or take. That's the way to think about that line item. Protection products revenue I think there's another \u2013 there's a product we're going to actually be sunsetting here in the next quarter or two, so that should result in a little bit of acceleration in the decline of protection products revenue but not anything significant. And ultimately, I would expect mortgage revenue to be essentially gone here in the fourth quarter. So protection products will continue to attrite somewhat. I think we still believe at some point in time we may consider re-launching those products in a regulatory compliant fashion, but it wouldn't be this year, that's for sure. William Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon. Just wanted to talk about the NIM outlook a little bit; given the potential that higher rates may be pushed out. Does that change your funding costs strategy a bit? How are you positioned for asset sensitivity? And can you talk a little bit about where you see your credit card yields trending, given elevated pay down levels but the mix still pretty attractive? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I'll tackle the NIM part of the question. What I would say is as I said in our prepared remarks, we expect it to be pretty flat fourth quarter from where we ended the third quarter. And I think what we've said historically about 2016 is that we expected 2016 to remain at or above 9.5%. I think given what we're seeing right now, I would lean towards the above as opposed to at 9.5% for 2016. In terms of funding strategy, David, when I look at how we're positioned vis-\u00e0-vis our primary competitors as well as the regional banks, we're positioned about the 45th percentile or so of asset sensitivity. That doesn't feel like a decidedly bad place to be. It feels like we're right in the middle of the pack. That feels very comfortable place for us. We did stop several quarters back building any additional meaningful asset sensitivity into the book. So I think what you're likely to see us do is to the extent it's cost effective to do so, really more essentially maintain that positioning as opposed to anything else. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And just separately on capital, were you surprised that a major competitor \u2013 not competitor, but there was \u2013 another card issuer was not required to be a part of the CCAR process? And does that have an impact on your view of potentially capital deployment in the next CCAR process? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I'm not going to speculate as to competitors and why they were or weren't included in certain things or not included in certain things. I think we worry about what we're held accountable for, doing it well and making sure we're driving great returns for our shareholders, and that's where we're going to stay focused. Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : But I don't think we read anything into that that led us to believe there would be changes for us. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Mark, maybe just one quick question on expenses; I think the core came in better than some of us had expected, and I know you tried to dissect the expense base a number of different ways. When I go through the numbers I get about $200 million year-to-date of one-time expenses. If I look at this quarter's core annualized, it's well below or at or below $3.4 billion. So I guess, how do I think about what you consider to be a more normal growth rate in the expenses outside of all the noise that's going on under the hood with the AML/BSA costs and some other one-time items? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's a big question, Ryan. I'll do my best to address it concisely. But it's probably going to take me just a second there. So first of all in terms of annualizing this quarter's numbers for our run rate, I would not suggest you do that because, again this was not a particular high watermark from a marketing expense quarter, and I would say we always have some lumpiness to the expense level. So I would not suggest doing that as the right way to think about it. So while we think $3.6 billion is still a good number for this year, I think what we said is we expect it to be lower next year. The best advice I would have is go back to where we were in 2014, anchor to those levels, have some smart young analyst in your shop do a regression to take a look at what bank expense growth rates have been on an annualized basis over the course of the last two years, grow 2014 at that rate, and it will get you into the right ballpark for thinking about our expenses I think over the course of 2016. We'll give you more specific direct guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then maybe if I can ask one question to Roger, when I think about the spend volume, despite the fact that we have seen an impact from energy prices, it seems like you actually saw an acceleration this quarter, which surprised me given some of the macro disruptions that we saw. And I guess, maybe a comment on what you think is driving the acceleration that you're seeing in consumer spending. Is it just easier? Is it just the comps getting easier, or is there something else that you saw? Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : I think the \u2013 consumer spending in general is reasonably soft. As we get out, go out talking to our merchant partners, I'm not sure anyone is expecting a blowout holiday season. For us if you look at overall sales, clearly the biggest impact is coming from the gas prices. We do a lot of work to stimulate our base and to grow sales, and the new accounts again are contributing to sales at a higher rate than prior vintages. But I would not sort of call a robust comeback for the U.S. consumer at his point. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. I'm going to start on the regression. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): A lot of the questions that I was thinking about have been asked and answered, but as you look at your ability to kind of grow accounts with low marketing spend expense but still have an increasing rewards, I mean, do you think of it as actually kind of transferring that expense from spending it on account acquisition to actually the rewards function? I mean, is that a good way to think about it? Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yes. I would say that a big part of what is for us funding the double promotion is reduced promo rates in terms of durations for balance transfer as well as purchases, as well as it's generating a lower cost per account. And so we look at all those factors. But another key component is having a differentiated offer in the marketplace. And that's where for us at least having a proprietary network, having distinctive features like the free FICO and Freeze, all of that also adds up to giving us very attractive new account economics. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I guess my follow-up really is given that you do have a differentiated offer, given that you do have the J.D. Power designation, your own brand and lots of other things, I guess when should we expect you to actually develop and generate some of your own fee-based products, so that you can recover some of the revenue that you've been losing for the last several years? Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : That's something that we are looking at. There's a lot of focus on building out compliance functionality and risk management across the entire spectrum of our businesses. We will probably return at some point in the future, but there are a lot of other priorities. And I think we're getting a lot of value from some of the functions and features we're putting out there that don't cost anything. So if you look at free FICO, that's something that a lot of issuers and even third parties used to charge for. We see a lot of value in giving that away for free and getting the benefit in terms of customers coming to Discover and carrying balances on their cards. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, I don't disagree. It just feels like given your positioning, you'd be in a better shape to do it than some others. Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : Could be. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Thanks very much. Actually most of my questions have been asked. I guess I have one out of curiosity. It's a little bit about your opinion of where you think we are in the credit cycle. On one level, you guys are running very low losses, very low delinquencies. You may be even more comfortable signing up new accounts. On the other hand, we've got more mixed economic data. I think there's an emerging concern that we're at a tail end or at least the latter part of the credit cycle. I'm just wondering what do you guys think about that. And what do you do to balance those offsetting thoughts as you kind of enter next year? Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : So you can rest assured that when we sign up new accounts, we are not assuming that peak losses are in the 2% range. So there's a big difference between the models we use in booking new accounts and where the overall portfolio is now. What I would say though, and Mark made it clear, it is a remarkably benign environment. And if you look at things such as our 30-day delinquency rate, it looks pretty calm as far out as the eye can see. Now there's a lot of work that goes into managing those losses, both in terms of underwriting as well as the work supporting our customers when they get into challenging circumstances. But again, I think that the environment continues to look very, very good as we look forward. That doesn't mean we're being any less disciplined in how we're booking new accounts, whether that's in card, student loans, or personal loans. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Great. Thank you. I think this is a question for Roger. You talked a bit about new accounts and better activation on those new accounts. But what I was curious about is if you look at your more seasoned accounts, isn't that where the opportunity lies for increased activation? And if you could talk about activation rates on those more seasoned accounts, how they've trended year-over-year. And then what your outlook might be as you try to maybe gain more activation from those accounts looking at the next 12 months. Can you talk about that? Because that seems to be where there could be more of an opportunity, unless I'm completely mistaken. Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : Well, yeah, I did not mean to suggest that with our focus on new accounts we're ignoring the existing portfolio. Traditionally our loan growth comes almost 50-50 between new accounts and stimulating existing accounts. Frequently it's not the inactive existing accounts, it's the ones that have a low level of activity. So we're the second card in the wallet and we want to become first card. We do a lot of different promotions, whether it's leveraging our network to do specific merchant offers, the rotating 5% program encourages them to spend perhaps in categories where they haven't spent before, even promotions like we're doing with Apple Pay encourages them to put Discover card top-of-wallet for mobile payments. So there's a tremendous amount of activity stimulating the portfolio, as well as booking new accounts. Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : So can you give us a sense for how much additional activity has been stimulated on those existing accounts with your marketing activity over, say, the last 12 months just so we have a sense for that? Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : I would just say traditionally our loan growth has come about 50-50 between growth from new accounts. Clearly, we benefit from having a lower attrition rate and very low charge-off rate. So in terms of driving growth from existing accounts, there's less of a hole to make up. But I think beyond that rough 50-50 mix, we don't more precisely disclose where the growth comes from. Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. And then just a quick one on the rewards rate. Again you talked about that, the expected increase in Q4. Didn't give any sort of expectation for 2016 yet. But I was curious about the interplay between rewards rate and yield, because it looks like card yield has held up pretty well relative to the rewards rate going up. So is it basically just the post-CARD Act function where the limitations on re-pricing that have maybe made it less feasible to maybe price lower on the rate, relative to giving more rewards? Or is it just the rewards resonate more with borrowers compared to lower loan rates? I'm just curious about that. Thanks. Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : I think that's right. Post-CARD Act, it's a lot more challenging to compete in terms of the go-to rate on cards, because you've lost your ability to change that. There's still competition around balance transfer, promotional rates, but in general, you see less competition for those go-to rates. I would say also benefiting the net interest margin is the low charge-off, and so that's helping support a higher NIM. But I think we are seeing a lot of competition in rewards these days. It's a combination of, to your point, the CARD Act impacts, as well as I would say some issuers that are pursuing a spend-based model where a lot of the focus is on very rich rewards. Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. I've got another follow-up for you on card loan growth. Are there any other specific investments you're making or promotions you're going to be running in the fourth quarter looking forward on top of, Roger, which you already mentioned, the extension of the promotional period, the Apple Pay, to help accelerate loan growth here? Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : In terms of the ones that are driving the rewards rate, it is largely coming from \u2013 we do have the seasonal 5% program, the double cash promotion, and then what we're running with Apple Pay. Those are the biggest drivers. We do have as always a lot of marketing activity planned, everything from new account solicitations to continuing to stimulate the existing portfolio. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And as we look into the first quarter or the early part of next year when you normally would seasonally see a drop-off in your reward expense, should we expect that to be a little bit more elevated as you look to continue to kind of reaccelerate loan growth? Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, Mark, what I would say there, again as I'm not prepared to speak to 2016 in specifics. But I would say on a full-year basis, you're clearly going to be looking at a higher rewards rate I think than you'll see for a full-year basis in 2015. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And just one last clarifying point. Mark, did you indicate earlier that for 2016, you would expect provisions inside of the 2.5% that you guided to for this year? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. I was speaking to what we expected for 2015. We'll give our 2016 guidance on the fourth quarter call. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yep. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first wanted to circle back on some of the stuff you talked about recently, Mark, on EMV expenses. Is this something that is going to be mostly done in 2015 or will it creep into 2016 and beyond? Can you just give us some color of how recurring EMV transition is in its nature? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I think the EMV expenses that we specifically called out earlier this year were really more what I would call the one-time oriented expenses associated with tokenization and pushing out EMV. So I would not expect those expenses to recur. I do think a little bit of that $35 billion total is likely to bleed into the early part of next year as opposed to fully being spent this year. What I would say is I would just remind everybody that reissuance costs for EMV cards are higher than reissuance costs for a mag-stripe card. So in a run rate reissuance world that probably has a little bit of impact, but from the standpoint of the one-time costs I called out, no, I do not expect to see those increase beyond the levels we have called out. Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. And then sort of similar question on Home Loans, you had $23 million of expenses in the second quarter, another $23 million this quarter for wind-down and exit. Are we pretty close to the end on that one, or is maybe a little bit more to come also? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's going to be a little bit more to bleed through in the fourth quarter. So GAAP requires some of the charges you take \u2013 you actually can't take until you actually shutter the doors and turn off the lights. So it will be smaller than this quarter's number. But there will be a little bit bleeding through in the fourth quarter, and then it will be over. Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Got it. Thanks very much. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Howlett with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Matt P. Howlett - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my question. Just on the loan loss reserve, it looks like the $10 million release on the student lending and the personal lending, I'm not sure if those parts were the PCI but I guess getting back to your charge-off comments before, the credit looks stable in both those asset classes, but it doesn't appear that long-term that's the run rate that's sustainable, you're growing those balances. I guess if there's any indication will we need reserve building if that continues to grow at the rate they're growing at? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I guess what I would say is a lot of moving parts and pieces there. Let me try and tackle them all. On the student lending piece specifically, the release was relatively small as you noted. It was driven by better expectations for future losses on loans that are currently in deferment. So that's what drove that piece of the puzzle. In terms of looking forward, it's just hard to say, quite honestly, how much \u2013 we've called now for two years in a row for growth in the portfolio to outstrip remaining goodness left in the portfolio and just to be intellectually honest with our good friends, we've been wrong twice. Credit has continued to improve over that period of time. I think it just highlights what Roger alluded to earlier, and that is that in our working lifetimes, none of us have ever seen a credit environment that looks like this. CARD Act got implemented at the same time the crisis ripped a lot of forward charge-offs into a current period. So it's \u2013 I have used the analogy a few times now. If you think about it like the GPS in your car, in normal times it gets you to the street address. Today it's getting you to kind of the ZIP code. So I feel comfortable with the results we're getting, but in terms of the precision you're looking for, I'm not going to try and convince you that we've got it, because I don't think anybody does right now. Matt P. Howlett - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Gotcha. The credit looks extremely stable, there's no signs of deterioration. Just on the percentage, they're going to grow faster it looks like than the cards for a while. Is there any target? I mean, long-term target that you sort of think that this is going to get to and that's sort of the critical mass, is it 25%, 30%? Could it keep on just growing making a bigger percentage to the balance sheet longer term out? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I do think just given the relatively \u2013 the different sizes of our asset classes, you'll continue to see faster growth in personal loan and student loan. But luckily we are in the capital position where we can support growth across any of those. And so where we can find good growth that meets our profitability and credit hurdles, we're investing across all of our asset classes. Matt P. Howlett - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good afternoon. My first question relates to basically what your anticipation would be in terms of loan growth from a timing perspective. You know, you point out that the sales volume is ultimately going to lead to balance growth. You've had a good pickup in cards, you had a good pickup in spending ex-gas. How long do you think it takes for that to ultimately percolate into balance growth? Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : It's hard to pin down precisely because there are a lot of other factors. I would point out we are still seeing healthy balance growth in our card business as well as very strong loan growth across the personal and student loan side. Where holiday sales go will be a factor as well. I would point to the new accounts as well as the easier year-over-year comps on gas as two helpful factors. Beyond that, I wouldn't want to put out a number in terms of where growth is going to go any time soon. Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Just maybe two follow-up questions, or one follow-up and one new question. Is there a natural horizon that you would expect balances to grow after a new card acquisition? That would be the first question. And then separately, this is a bit of a sensitive topic, I know, but just in terms of the value that you all ascribe to the payments business in the closed loop that you operate, obviously there's been a lot of focus on unlocking value in transactions that ultimately would possibly value that business higher outside of Discover. And you pointed to \u2013 Mark, you discussed it in terms of optionality at a recent investor conference, and I'm wondering what factors you would need to see in order to start to exercise some of that optionality? Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so let me start with maybe the second question. I think when you think about our payments business, it's important to keep in mind it's not just the payments segment, but rather the network that our proprietary card runs on. And I talked about the benefits we get in terms of differentiation in terms of the ability to work directly with merchants. Quite frankly you're seeing one of the largest card issuers out there head the other way in terms of trying to build their own proprietary networks. So I think if you look, for example, at the returns that we and American Express generate, both in different ways, but generate within the card issuing business, I don't think it's a coincidence that the two of us are generating the highest returns, but also have a proprietary network. Now we believe our partnership strategy and working with partners, such as SAP and Ariba, such as PayPal, such as all the global networks around the world, we think that one is the right one to maximize shareholder value and are committed to pursuing that. But again I think it's not as simple as just looking at the payment segment. You've got to keep in mind the value that we see for the card issuing side of the business. Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And I guess \u2013 well maybe to retort that a little bit, it's not as obvious that there's any value ascribed in the stock for that and I wonder how you would see or think about trying to, I guess, maximize shareholder returns versus just the value to you of the network itself? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Ken, what I would say is that the management team, not just on this topic, but across the board, I mean I think we've proven ourselves to care greatly about driving great returns for our shareholders, putting 20% north ROEs looks pretty darn good. I think at the end of the day, you shouldn't take us as believing that we don't ever question our own approaches. We question them regularly and we look at options regularly. So I think you should take Roger's comments as that we've spent a lot of time looking and that we believe very strongly, we're pursuing the right strategy based upon what we see right now. Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. They've actually all been asked and answered. Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : Hi, Rick. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Rick. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Cheryl Pate with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Cheryl M. Pate - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. I just wanted to circle back to the loan growth that we've talked about several times here. I'm just \u2013 I realize there's a lot of different moving pieces here, but I was wondering maybe there's some perspective you could share in terms of maybe what you've seen historically as to the timing and trajectory from marketing spend to new account growth to loan growth? Is \u2013 maybe you can just help us size the \u2013 have you seen that been more of a couple-of-quarter event? Is it more of a year lag? Just if you can help size that a little bit from historical experience? Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : Sure. And that was actually a part of \u2013 I got distracted with the second half of Ken's question. Usually for new accounts in the prime segment, the balances will build over the first two years. What can really change that is how focused you are on balance transfer, because if you're building it for retail sales, they'll continue to build. If you're using a lot of balance transfer, they'll build very, very quickly, and then pay down when the balance transfer expires. And depending on the issuer, that can be 12 months, 18 months. I think there's some people who will even go out 24 months. Given our focus on rewards, on all the other value components on service and what I talked about in terms of backing off the promotion durations, I think these new accounts, we do expect balances to continue building for the first two years. Cheryl M. Pate - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow up, in terms of the new card account growth this quarter, maybe you can help us think about how has the \u2013 still relatively new \u2013 but how has the travel card been resonating within that and driving account growth? Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : So the Miles Card is doing well. It's exceeding our expectations, but it's still a pretty small part of our overall new accounts. It's really \u2013 our core product is Cashback and the Discover it Cashback. For those people who prefer miles, we have the Discover it Miles, but it's a much smaller component of our overall new account origination. Cheryl M. Pate - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. Just to follow-up on two small topics, one, Mark, I actually did that regression and I came up with sort of a growth CAGR of 7%, which is somewhat higher than what I would have guessed before I did the math. And I'm wondering if that \u2013 or speculating rather that a lot of it includes that many of your peer group also had elevated compliance costs. But does a high-single-digit figure seem like a reasonable number or perhaps maybe too high end? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think that's too high end. The number I'm using looks more like a mid-single-digit number, probably a slightly lower mid-single-digit number is the way I'd think about it. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you for that. And just to follow-up on the cost of funds, how should we think about the cost of funds going forward? Should it \u2013 will it appear similar to this quarter in terms of some of the incremental costs seeping through? And how are the pricing dynamics offsetting that on sort of a forward basis to sustain this very solid margin? Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : So in terms of the overall cost of funds, I think Mark had talked on previous calls about how we've positioned the balance sheet. You know, clearly the rate increases seem to be pushing out more and more, so we do expect some good stability in terms of NIM as we look forward. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I guess what I would say is, you know, we said at or above 3.5% (sic) [9.5%] through 2016. What I would echo today is that I would be much more comfortable with above 3.5% (sic) [9.5%] in 2016 than I was when we said at or above 3.5% (sic) [9.5%]. Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : You mean 9.5% R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : 9.5%. Sorry. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : My apologies. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Arnold with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, guys. I was just wondering if you could update us on your views around mobile payments. I mean, Apple Pay gets most of everyone's attention these days, but technology moves pretty fast. So just curious if you could give us some big-picture views there, please. Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : Sure. We are working with Apple Pay as well as other mobile wallets out there. I think it's a space that continues to evolve. We see some attractive benefits in terms of what we can do by being a card issuer as well as having our own network. So a lot of flexibility in terms of how we put it together. There are some investments, and I think it will take a while to see who the winners and losers are. But I think as part of our partnership strategy, when the market is evolving this quickly, you want to put quite a few chips down. You know, but I would say clearly Apple Pay is off to an early lead. And we're seeing very strong results in terms of take-up on our offer. Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Terrific. Thanks. And then we haven't talked about this in a while, but I was just curious if any news, any updates you could provide on the checking product. Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : Sure. So we are continuing to market the checking product but only to our existing base. We're not offering it to the broad market. So it's really just cross-sold to our card base. I think we're in a complete AML/BSA build-out and some other components before we take it to the broad market. It's a product that we're very excited about, but realistically it will take a while before it has a material impact on our overall funding costs. And I would also focus beyond checking though, we are working aggressively in terms of our savings account, our money market, our CDs, so there's a big part of our direct-to-consumer deposit business beyond checking. Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Excellent. Thanks so much for the color. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Mark, some of the data that we track for card mailings has gotten a little more volatile lately. And I was just curious over the last 12 months or so how your digital mix has shifted in your card business. And also could you talk a little bit about the mix in how you approach your personal lending from a mailings versus digital perspective? Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : Sure. It's Roger. I'll cover this one. Digital continues to grow, but direct mail remains very important for the card business. And there's a difference between what you send out and how people respond. So actually we get more applications from mobile devices than we do mailed back through the mail. But, again, I would say digital continues to grow. For personal loans, by and large up until this point, our marketing has been by invitation only. So whether it's cross-sold to our existing customers or going out to the broad market, we target specific profiles from the bureau data. So given that, our mix has been very heavily weighted towards direct mail or other cross-sell channels internally. About two quarters ago, we started opening that up, but it's still in transition. So I think you would expect to see the non-direct mail solicitations grow on the personal loan side. It's actually that broad market response that is helping drive record levels of origination. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Chris C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one more on the card loan growth side. Thanks for all the color earlier. Attrition, like it seems to me like the pressure on the card business at this point is a lot of competition in the reward space. Can you talk about attrition rates? And have they increased or stabilized recently that would give you a little more confidence that we're close to a bottom? Thanks. Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : So for us, attrition rates have been very stable and amongst the best in the industry. And that's where I think you see the benefits of what won us J.D. Power in terms of hundred percent for our employees' customer service, a great customer experience, across every aspect. So if you look at our customers and how they recommend Discover to a friend, their satisfaction, very, very high. So we have seen very stable and very low attrition rates. Chris C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. One more quick follow-up. Any change directionally in the competitive pressures from the alternative lenders, the online lenders, in the either the card business or the student personal loan businesses? Roger C. Hochschild - President & Chief Operating Officer : We don't see the alternative lenders as much on the card side. On the personal loan side, they are aggressive competitors. They put a lot of mail out in the marketplace. In general, they target a much broader credit spectrum than we do. And operate a lot outside of the prime space. But given our brand, given our value proposition, I think that's even in this competitive environment, we are seeing record levels of origination. Chris C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: That's great. Thanks, Roger. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Jason Harbes with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, hi. Good evening. Most of my questions have already been answered. But maybe just to follow-up on the NIM outlook, you know, the stable NIM expectation, I guess my question is to what extent is that a function of potentially rising interest rates over the next 12 months or so? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I would say it's a reflection of where we see the forward curve right now more so than anything else. If we actually do get some movement in the rate environment, we are positively levered to that based on our current asset liability positioning and would actually see margin expansion through the first several hundred basis points of rate increases. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just to follow-up on a comment you made, I think, last quarter around the tax rate, is that still going to be a little bit lower here in the fourth quarter? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think I would describe it probably as in line, maybe slightly lower but generally in line with the third quarter is the way I think about it. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You bet. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions. And I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill Franklin for any final remarks. Bill Franklin - Vice President- Investor Relations : All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. If you have any other follow-up questions, feel free to call the Investor Relations team. Have a good night. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great evening.",

LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Discover Financial Services Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Bill Franklin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Bill Franklin - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Sabrina. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin, as always, with slide two of our earnings presentation, which is on the investor relations section of Discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8K report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs, which are on our website and on file with the SEC. In the fourth quarter 2015 earnings material, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A period, it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated. So now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm going to review our fourth quarter and full year results and discuss our key focus areas for 2016. Then, I will hand it over to Mark to review the fourth quarter in more detail and share some forward-looking guidance. Starting on slide three of our earnings presentation, we've reported fourth quarter net income of $500 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.14, up 31%, due to some one-time charges in the prior year. We were able to drive a return on equity of 18% for the quarter, despite higher loan loss provisions and higher non-recurring expenses driven by the anti-money laundering look back. Turning to slide four, Discover achieved total loan growth of 3.5% over the prior year. Card receivables grew 3% this quarter, lower than we would like, however, this was partly due to lower promotional balance growth compared to the prior period. Total sales for the quarter increased 3% from the prior year or roughly 5% excluding gas sales. Lower gas prices have continued to impact our sales and card loan growth more than we had anticipated, however, we believe it also somewhat helped credit results in 2015. Moving to our next largest asset class, private student loans grew 3%. However, excluding our acquired portfolios, we achieved 16% growth year-over-year. Personal loans increased to $5.5 billion, up 10% from the prior year. On the right-hand side of slide four, we lay out payments volume growth. Proprietary volume continued to increase in support of the card issuing business, however, our third party payment segment had lower volume compared to the prior year. A large part of the volume in this segment comes from PULSE, where we saw continued declines in the challenging post-Durbin environment. Performance was good in the other network businesses, although they represent a much smaller portion of the total payments volume. Network Partners volume increased significantly, driven by AribaPay volumes, while Diners volume decreased slightly as reported, but was up nicely on a constant dollar basis. Now, I'm going to touch on our full year financial results, shown on slide five. In 2015, our earnings crossed the $5 per share mark for the first time. Revenue increased 3% from the prior year to $8.7 billion. Moving down this slide, provisioning grew roughly in line with the average loan growth. Expense growth was primarily driven by higher regulatory and compliance costs, particularly related to our AML consent order remediation. Due to the strength of our capital generation and buyback program, EPS increased 5% for the full year versus 2014. Moving to slide six, we accomplished a great deal in 2015 to move the business forward. We continued to grow our balance sheet with total loans up 3.5% from the prior year. We introduced new features and benefits throughout the year to attract and retain customers. In card, we introduced the innovative Freeze It capability, which allows customers to suspend their credit card with a few clicks from their app in the event it's misplaced. I can personally attest to how well it works. And we offered a promotional 10% cash back bonus on in-store purchases using the Apple Pay, which drove adoption in our card base and also attracted some new card members to Discover. At the same time, we continued to be disciplined in managing credit, as our total net charge-off rate excluding PCI loans declined 5 basis points. Our card loss rate remains among the lowest in the industry. We also achieved record originations in our non-card loans. We increased brand awareness for student loans through radio advertising and The Freshman Experience, a unique partnership with NBC News. In December, we launched FAFSA Assistant, a free tool to help families navigate government student aid filings and educate prospective students about their funding options, which should continue to increase Discover student loan awareness in 2016. In personal loans, we launched several new digital initiatives to help drive growth. In payments, the competitive landscape in debit remains challenging. In 2015, we established new partnerships, including network-to-network agreements, new Diners Club licensees, and at the same time, we grew volume with existing payment partnerships like AribaPay. Perhaps most importantly, the Discover Network continues to provide significant benefits to our card issuing business, as evidenced by the fact that we are accepted at more than 37 million locations worldwide, roughly 20% more than a year ago. As we look back on 2015, we feel good about our accomplishments. We generated a 21% return on equity for the full year, and repurchased 6% of our stock. Now, let's move to slide seven. For 2016, our vision is unchanged. We aspire to be the leading U.S. direct bank and payments partner. Our key focus areas for the year will help us move forward towards accomplishing our vision. In 2016, we are targeting faster loan growth, which you will see in the guidance that Mark goes through later in the call. We expect this growth to be balanced between new accounts and our existing portfolio. Discover it continues to perform well in the marketplace, helped by the double cash back bonus offer for new card members during the first year. While we anticipate the majority of our new account growth will come from our flagship Discover it card, we expect to see additional growth from our Miles it card and the recently launched secured card. To support the growth of the Miles it card we introduced last year, we've recently aired our first television advertisement to increase awareness of the product and features. In addition, we announced the broad market launch of the Discover it secured card on Monday. This product will give customers who are new to credit access to the features and the benefits of a Discover it product, fully secured by a cash deposit. This is another opportunity for us to reach new customers and retain them, as they develop a strong credit history. In the existing portfolio, we have a number of initiatives, some of which are already underway, to support loan growth, including a strategy to re-engage inactives when they receive their EMV card, appropriate credit line increases for eligible customers, and profitable balance transfers. Underlying all these initiatives is our commitment to a disciplined approach to credit management, which has served Discover well through previous credit cycles. In addition, we will continue to build out our digital capabilities with enhanced customer features. By the end of the month, we will have completed the full rollout of our unique Pay with Cashback functionality, online and in our app. This will offer customers the ability to pay their monthly card bill using their cashback bonus seamlessly. We continue to innovate in the features and benefits that drive customer satisfaction and long-term loyalty. Moving down the slide, in 2016 we will be very focused on operating expense leverage. Historically we've had one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry. While our 2015 ratio was elevated due to some one-time items, we are managing the business to trend back towards our long-term target. In 2016, we expect to invest in growth and to see increases in ongoing compliance costs while also finding ways to optimize the core expense base. We have a unique set of payment assets which present many long-term opportunities for us. Near term, we are focused on getting the most from our proprietary network for our card issuing business, including increased acceptance and brand differentiation. While Payment Services has struggled with some third-party volume losses, we expect volume to stabilize prior to the end of the year and we continue to seek opportunities to bring more volume from third parties on to our network. We are looking broadly across this segment; domestically, internationally, in business to business, and in consumer payments. We have the ability to scale significantly and are committed to driving value. In 2016, we will be particularly focused on closing out our AML look-back and continuing to enhance our compliance-related functions. Investing in compliance and risk management will enable us to meet increasing regulatory requirements while also strengthening our operations and supporting our leadership position in customer service. And lastly, we will optimize our capital deployment so we can consistently deliver strong returns to our shareholders while driving quality organic growth. We have big goals for 2016, and are hard at work to achieve them. We're especially working to accelerate profitable loan growth. Now, I will turn the call to Mark to discuss the details of our fourth quarter results and forward-looking guidance. Mark? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, David, and good evening, everyone. I'll start with the revenue detail on slide eight of our presentation. Net interest income increased $60 million or 4% over the prior year due to loan growth. Total non-interest income was up $108 million. I would remind you that the prior year period included a one-time charge of $178 million related to the elimination of the rewards forfeiture reserve. Excluding this one-time item in the prior year, non-interest income declined $70 million. The rewards rate was 118 basis points, up 8 basis points from the prior year on an adjusted basis, largely due to the double rewards program for new card members as well as our fourth quarter Apple Pay promotion. Protection products revenue continues to decline, down $15 million year-over-year, given our suspension of sales in late 2012. Other revenue decreased $30 million, primarily due to the loss of mortgage origination revenue as we closed our direct mortgage operation this year. Payment Services revenue was down $14 million, primarily due to lower transaction processing revenue at PULSE. This was largely the result of the previously disclosed loss of volume from a large debit issuer. Turning to slide nine. Total loan yield of 11.49% was up 9 basis points over the prior year. This higher yield was offset by higher funding costs and a larger liquidity portfolio. Combined, these drove net interest margin on receivables down 1 basis point from the prior year to 9.75%. However, on a sequential basis, NIM expanded by 13 basis points, driven by higher card yield due to portfolio mix. Personal loans were the only asset class where the yield declined from the prior year. Shorter terms year-over-year and a $5 million one-time adjustment to deferred loan origination cost drove the decline. As the origination cost adjustment was nonrecurring, we would expect that in the first quarter of 2016, personal loan yields will rebound to levels roughly in line with the third quarter of 2015. Turning to slide 10, total operating expense was roughly flat, in part because both periods included some one-time items. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized $48 million in charges in other expenses associated with two items. First, a $27 million impairment of goodwill related to the mortgage origination business, which we subsequently exited. And second, a $21 million mark to fair value related to Diners Club Italy being classified as held for sale, which we've now sold. In the current period, we incurred $37 million in expense resulting from the anti-money laundering look-back project. Adjusting for these items, expenses were $12 million or 1% higher year-over-year. Turning to provision for loan losses in credit on slide 11, provision for loan losses was higher by $27 million, due primarily to a higher reserve build compared to the prior year. As David mentioned earlier, provision growth on a full year basis was essentially in line with average loan growth. The credit card net charge-off rate was 2.18%, down 8 basis points year-over-year and up 14 basis points sequentially. The 30-plus day delinquency rate was relatively flat year-over-year at 1.72%, and up 7 basis points from the prior quarter. The private student loan net charge-off rate excluding purchase credit impaired loans decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 1.3%. The 30-plus day delinquency rate increased by 11 basis points over the prior year to 1.9% as the organic book continues to enter repayment. Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was up 8 basis points year-over-year to 2.3%, due to the seasoning of newer vintages in line with expectations, and the over 30 day delinquency rate was up 10 basis points to 89 basis points. Across all of our portfolios, we remain pleased with our strong credit results. Next, I'll touch on our capital position on slide 12. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.9%. The sequential decrease in our capital ratios was driven by a combination of seasonal loan growth and capital deployment. On that latter point, we repurchased $435 million of stock in the quarter. In total during 2015, we returned over $2 billion in capital to shareholders with a 94% payout ratio. To complete the repurchases we submitted as part of last year's CCAR capital actions, we plan to buy back over $800 million of shares in the first half of 2016. Moving to long-term guidance on slide 13. The majority of these items have not changed since our last investor day. So I'll focus only on the two that have changed and are circled on the page. I would remind you that the items on this page represent expected averages through the cycle, and do not necessarily reflect our expectations for 2016. Going forward we'll be guiding to total loan growth as opposed to the component pieces. We expect long-term total loan growth of 4% to 6%. Consistent with this change, we've also updated the long-term guidance to reflect the total net charge-off rate excluding PCI loans, which we expect to be 3% to 4%. Turning to slide 14, let's spend a minute on guidance that is specific to 2016. First, we expect total loan growth to be in the range of 4% to 6%, in line with our long-term target. Keep in mind that card represents roughly 80% of our portfolio. So achieving 4% to 6% total loan growth requires us to accelerate card growth from the recent trend. On that last point, I want to remind you of a nuance in how we report our monthly loan data. We don't process payments for the card business on Saturdays. So when a month ends on a Saturday, our 8K reported receivables include Saturday's sales, but no payments from that day. This can create distortions in year-over-year comparisons. A good rule of thumb is to expect a positive bump of 50 basis points to 60 basis points to the year-over-year growth when the current month ends on a Saturday, and to expect a drag of 50 basis points to 60 basis points when the prior year month ends on a Saturday. Obviously, this is just a timing impact, but we are calling it out because both January and February ended on a Saturday last year. As a result, our relative year-over-year growth will be understated in our reporting for each of those months this year. Moving to our outlook for net interest margin in 2016, we expect it to be what I would call relatively stable when compared to our full year 2015 NIM of 9.68%, perhaps with a bit of an upward bias. Further increases in rates would benefit us, based on the modest asset sensitivity we built into the balance sheet. But we may also see some offsets depending upon the level of card promotional activity and runoff in higher rate and default-priced balances. With respect to rewards, we're planning to spend more on a full-year basis in 2016. Specifically, we expect the full year rate around 115 basis points or roughly 7 basis points higher than 2015. A good portion of the increase is the first year double rewards program, which has delivered a lower cost per account and brought on more engaged customers; well worth the investment. Moving to non-interest, non-interchange revenue, as we've said throughout 2015, we expect this line item to be lower this year. The primary drivers are the exit of the direct mortgage origination product, which generated roughly $74 million in revenue in 2015; continued runoff in protection products revenue, which we estimate to be about $40 million lower in 2016; and lower Payment Services revenue, in part reflecting the sale of the Diners Club Italy franchise. Taking all of this into account, we expect non-interest, non-interchange revenue to decline approximately $125 million in 2016. Moving to the total net charge-off rate ex-PCI loans, we expect it to be slightly higher than 2015. The credit environment continues to feel benign, with our reserve build in the fourth quarter reflective of the seasoning of several years of card loan growth at levels above the portfolio charge-off rate, in line with our expectations. In addition, we assume a more modest outlook for improvement in the U.S. economy in 2016. Finally, we expect operating expense to be slightly above $3.5 billion next year. This reflects the roll off of the AML/BSA look back expenses over the course of 2016, incremental expenses for ongoing regulatory and compliance costs that are facing all participants in the industry, initiatives to accelerate loan growth, as well as operating efficiency improvements. Based on this level of expense, we expect to drive positive operating leverage and decrease our efficiency ratio, which is already one of the lowest among large banks. To close things out, we have a business model that is generating strong returns on equity. While third party payment volume has declined recently, we expect our Payment Services segment volume to stabilize prior to the end of the year. This should position us for growth in future years, which is why we are keeping our long-term payments volume growth target at 10%. Near term, we are very focused on the remediation of our AML/BSA consent order and reducing expenses in 2016. We'll be focused on accelerating total loan growth in a disciplined fashion, focusing on opportunities that are profitable for the long term, and not sacrificing credit for the sake of growth. Last but not least, we have a strong capital position that enables us to both invest in the business to drive growth and deliver prudently aggressive payouts to shareholders within the constraints the CCAR process. That concludes our formal remarks. So now, I'll turn the call back to our operator Sabrina to begin the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes, David or Mark, I just wanted to confirm the reserve build this quarter was just sort of a seasonality and you're not seeing anything at least today that would suggest any weakening in the overall portfolio. I was wondering if you can comment on that. And I know in the past, you've provided a provision to average loan ratio. Would you care to provide that for 2016? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, on the fourth quarter number, Don, I would say the card reserve rate was 2.68% this quarter, I believe. And over the last five quarters to six quarters it's been pretty consistently in that 2.6% to 2.7% range. So I would say, you know, it's consistent. The provision really on a full-year basis is consistent with the loan growth on a full-year basis which is kind of, I think, what we've been saying people should be expecting. So, no, we don't see any change at all in the dynamics of the portfolio. Our guidance for next year reflects what I called, I think, a slight increase in charge-offs. We still expect that to remain clearly in the low 2%s range. I think, we learned our lesson last year trying to give provision guidance and we're shying away from that this year and just sticking with charge-offs. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then on the rewards obviously going up for good reasons, but I was just curious, would your sense be that that's likely to sort of \u2013 if you are wrong, maybe you're going to tick a little higher or are you being pretty conservative? It seems like competition is going to remain pretty healthy into 2016. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think, we've given guidance based on what we expect. Certainly that can always be a little higher or a little lower than guidance depending on \u2013 because there's a lot of promotional decisions that we make along the way, and so it could vary from that, but what I would say is that it's less about competition and more about us doing tests and controls and deciding what to spend in rewards versus the marketing line and what has the best net present values for new accounts and stimulating the portfolio and that means that has led to higher spend over time in this line. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would say the big driver, Don, is the double rewards program on new accounts and that's driving a very low CPA, cost per account acquired right now. And the customers who are coming on with the new accounts are driving very engaged type behaviors, that we expect to materialize in loan growth as we move forward throughout 2016. So, I think, it's a pretty potent investment right now is the bottom line, based on what we see; but I would echo David's comment, it's something that we look at from time to time and could change. As always if we update our outlook and our guidance, you'll know about it. Bill Franklin - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next caller. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Your line is now open. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. I guess 2015 was a year of lot of surprises on the expense line. As we look towards 2016, how much execution risk is there in terms of surprises not popping up on expenses? I mean, do you guys feel like, you know, you have enough levers available to you so that if there are surprises, you could still meet your expectations? And secondly, just to Mark, could you define slight in terms of the increase for charge-offs? Thank you. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So on the first point, Sanjay, what I would say is, look, we clearly have expense levers. You make decisions from time to time on whether or not you want to pull those levers, right? We knew that the look back project for the AML/BSA was going to be big dollars. We knew it was one-time nonrecurring and cutting muscle that drives the business forward didn't make a lot of sense, right in that regard. That being said, we covered an awful lot of ongoing expense increases in regulatory and compliance world with operating efficiency gains this year. I think you should look to see us do the same next year. Candidly, I think, we kind of landed right on top, more or less, of our OpEx guidance for the full year for this past year, came in I think, $15 million over, something like that, but on a $3.6 billion line item, kind of feel like we did a decent job. That notwithstanding, I think at the end of the day, there clearly are levers we can pull when it makes sense to pull them. With respect to what is a slight increase in charge-offs? I kind of reiterate what I said to Don, maybe expand on it a little bit. It's going to stay clearly in the low 2% range, Sanjay. We do not see any signs of a turn in the credit environment. We are operating with many years of growth, seasoning in the portfolio right now, and as we've said, new account season at loss rates higher than legacy portfolio. So there's a bit of an impact there, but the credit environment itself continues to feel very benign and we're not trying to signal some giant inflection point in charge-offs. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You bet. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Ho of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question regarding your through the cycle guidance in terms of the loan growth, versus the charge-off rates. Given that's through the cycle and then obviously baking in consumer conservatism, I guess the question is, would it be possible that loan growth would be above kind of your 4% to 6% range at that level of charge-off rate assuming the economy is not deteriorating in any major fashion just on the part of consumer being less conservative. Is that the right way to think about that? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think that on loan growth we have established a new long-term target of 4% to 6% of total loans, and we said that we were actually committed to being in that range next year, which implies some acceleration. Given that we're below that range today, I would not be looking for us to exceed it. I think, we're going to work really hard to get into the range this coming year and we think 4% to 6% would be gaining market share in prime credit cards and across our other businesses. So we think it would be a very good outcome, without taking excessive credit risk. Charge-offs, you noticed that we have a long-term target and it's very disconnected with where we are, and what Mark said is slight increase. So clearly we expect to be significantly below that long-term range during this coming year. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And what would get you to the 3% to 4% or what factors would drive that? Is it mostly macro or are you assuming any kind of decrease in conservatism on the part of the consumer? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would say macro factors. And I think that we feel like we've been in an unusually benign time period from a credit perspective. On the flip side, it's been a very lack of loan growth time for the industry, coming off of a shrinking period, but on charge-offs, it's been unusually benign, and so we're expecting over a longer period of time for things to normalize. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just if I may, one more question on the seasoning of recent growth. At what point does some of the more recent or prior vintage years start to tail off in terms of moving down the peak of the loss curve and hopefully providing some tailwind to reserving from here? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So cards are the biggest driver. They tend to peak at about 24 months after origination. So if you think about it, you have three years of vintages under the peak of the seasoning curve, if you will. A year ago is 12 months in; two years ago is at the peak; and three years ago is coming down the peak, pretty much equivalent to where a year ago was more or less. The issue is if we are successful in increasing our loan growth, you will pick that up, right? Because if you have successively larger vintages, the maturation of those vintages will drive provision. It's growth math and, candidly, I think, it's a good problem to have. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler of Stifel. Your line is now open. Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to focus again on the card business and the competitive environment. You mentioned that it's not only having an impact on your rewards rate, but we have seen an increase in the level of rewards and cashback, in particular your competition. So, maybe you could just dimensionalize, is that getting any better into your outlook. And then sort of a related follow-up. I'm surprised to see marketing investment down this quarter. I know that it was sort of lumpy quarter to quarter. But do you plan to increase marketing investment in 2016? Is some of the testing you're doing giving you some of the confidence that you're going to hit your loan growth target? Thanks. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, to handle the first one, I mean, competition is up both overall and in rewards, and I think that's particularly true in the rewards segment. But what I said before about as we have increased our rewards, it hasn't been just because we are seeing rewards of competitors. It's because we've tested into programs that we think will produce better results. And certainly, one of the reasons that we didn't grow marketing as much in the fourth quarter is because we chose to invest more on the rewards side, particularly promotional rewards for the new accounts, as Mark mentioned, versus cost per new account. We also have been achieving some nice savings in cost per account. So the money has gone a little bit further. And, Mark, I will let you answer the second. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, and as we look forward, I think the answer is we view marketing and rewards as interconnected investment. So you may see some geography flips year-on-year between those two, depending upon how we're looking to drive new account acquisition as well as utilization going forward. But I would not expect marketing expense to be flat on a year-over-year basis. Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then one quick follow-up, if I could. I think I know the answer to this, but I imagine your dipping into the secured card, the subprime space, is not a part of your increased growth expectations in balances in 2016 at this point? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. I would say the Miles card \u2013 of those two new products, the Miles card would probably have the greater impact. You see us advertising that on TV. Secured card, I view as a good feeder for the future. And I think as those customers in subsequent years, as we hope a number of them will exhibit good behavior, we'll be able to eventually drop the requirement of the security, get to more normal credit lines. And so I think 2017, 2018 is when you'd start to see some of the maturing of those secured cards in the prime portfolio, and that's our real objective. Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, I guess first just a quick comment. I mean, I think that I would have liked to hear, given that this is a somewhat noticeable earnings disappointment, a little more urgency as to the pulling of the levers and kind of executing on the plan. I mean, given that you have some of your competitors see stable or improving loan growth even in this industry environment. So that's just kind of an observation. But I guess my question kind of really does relate to when you think about the growth really in net interest income, because that's really the driver of your revenue stream, are you expecting to see \u2013 what is it about the new accounts? Because in other words, if you're getting record numbers of new accounts, are they not building the balances? And how should we think about the development of that to be confident in a forecast of 4%, 5%, or 6% kind of into 2016? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, first, I think it's important to keep in mind the reasons growth decelerated, which a number of people that were focused particularly in the prime segment didn't see growth, saw less than we did. But one driver was the slower U.S. retail sales growth, in addition to the impact of falling gas prices, we talked about that. We also mentioned some of the actions we took to optimize the profitability of some promotional programs, so that cost us some growth. But looking forward, we do have significant urgency in accelerating growth. That's why we've committed to that 4% to 6% total growth range for next year. And that should come both from the new account side, as well as the existing portfolio, and there's a whole range of activities that we have focused on getting more new accounts, activating them more, leveraging balance transfer, the Miles card, gaining wallet share on the portfolio side as we continue to roll out features like Freeze it. So we have a lot of range of actions because, frankly, the economy and the prime market isn't very robust. So what we have to do is continue to gain market share as we've done for several years by differentiating our products. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Arnold of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, good afternoon, guys. David, I was just wondering if you can talk in a bit more detail about the potential opportunity to add third-party issuers, and maybe hitting on the appeal and what you see as an opportunity is perhaps as well as the challenges of getting new partners. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Well, if you look at our Payment segment, obviously, PULSE has been a challenge with (37:32) and some specific volume losses, but the other parts of payments, we have actually seen some nice gains, and particularly from Ariba, which has been an important new partner. We continue to be working closely with PayPal, and I still remain optimistic that in the long term, that is going to produce some volume. We continue to make some good progress with new partners around the world. We signed the three largest banks in Brazil and with a network there, network-to-network partners. We have seen very nice growth out of our partners in China and in India on Diners Club. So we are casting a very wide net to grow our third-party payments volume, and that's why we have still stuck to our 10% long-term growth target, even though we have been shrinking now, and so we're focused on turning that volume growth around to something positive. Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cheryl Pate of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Cheryl M. Pate - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to follow-up on sort of the loan growth in the card space, and sort of understand the point on rewards cost relative to marketing spend. I guess one more thing to add into the mix there is how should we think about the balance on profitable loan balance transfers, which maybe drive growth faster than rewards might take some more time to build up. Can you help us think through the dynamics there? And then secondly, just wondering if you could comment on card acquisition trends this quarter. Thanks. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. I think I won't comment on card acquisitions this quarter. We'll wait until the next call to answer that, but on the first two questions, loan growth from the new accounts, we've been driving \u2013 our double cashback bonus has been driving lower cost per account and a very attractive mix of cardholders. And those customers have been \u2013 we're seeing more spend, and maybe a little less balance transfer. And what that means is those new accounts we've put on \u2013 those in the last two quarters are going to continue to build their balances into next year. And so that's one of the things we're continuing to focus on is efforts that ultimately result in balance growth, and we're really pleased with the newer accounts, but it's not as instant as the balance transfer. Now, balance transfer, I think is still an opportunity. We pulled back a bit on balance transfer because we found some areas that we thought were not profitable, didn't meet our hurdles, but we are now pursuing some opportunities that we think will be more productive and more profitable. So, I think, we can probably do a little more balance transfer as well this year than we did last year. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, and Cheryl, on the tradeoff between marketing spend and rewards spend, they are in one regard, one and the same, right? So you are trying to build awareness, build utilization, you can do that by staying front of mind in the television and elsewhere. You can also do it by providing a rewards product that, on an everyday basis, engages that customer in ways that incents them to utilize the card as well. So they are both \u2013 kind of have a common purpose of driving utilization spend and ultimate loan growth on the card. The one thing I would follow on to David's earlier remarks with is loan growth from new accounts, from prime new accounts emerges down the road a little bit, right? So you originate the account. The account comes on the books. You begin to see the spend behavior come on to the card, but unless you're balance transferring a big balance over, right, it takes time for that utilization to build those balances up. So we continue to feel good about the ultimate impact of the new accounts we're putting on. We believe we'll begin to see through 2016 that manifest itself in loan growth, but there is a tad of a lag there. Cheryl M. Pate - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Bill Franklin - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich of D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Arren Cyganovich - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. I was wondering if you could touch a little bit on personal loans and student loans. We've talked a lot about credit card growth, where are your thoughts on those two categories going forward? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. As we mentioned, we were really pleased that we had record originations in both student loans and personal loans last year. We expect to do even more in both of those areas this coming year. One of the reasons that we moved to a total loans estimate is because those two businesses have become a bigger part of our total, and certainly the fact that we expect faster growth from those two businesses than card helps drive our overall loans up. And I guess the final thing I would say is that we're quite focused on some of the digital capabilities, enhancing our target marketing, we are doing more broad market in personal loans, and I mentioned a couple of the new endorsements or marketing features we have with NBC and others in student loans, which I think are helping to increase the awareness that Discover isn't just credit cards; it's also student loans. Arren Cyganovich - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, guys, for taking my question. We've heard you talk about something a little bit today that we haven't heard in a while which is gaining wallet share through line limit increases. Can you just talk about that opportunity, the pluses and the minuses there, and what makes you at this point more comfortable using that as a growth tool again? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I actually think we've been much more consistent than certain other competitors who I think went from not doing any to doing a bunch and saw a runoff and then saw big increases. We've actually been pretty steady. So I would say that we'll continue to appropriately increase lines, but I wouldn't call that out as any dramatic change for us. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. I mean, it strikes me, given that your borrowers have proven to be very responsible over time, it's a pretty convenient \u2013 or it's a pretty easy way to move up in wallet. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it is if you're careful in how you do it. And so we are giving lines where we can. We are finding some opportunities. Certainly the further we come into stable credit lines and the more stability many consumers have, the better their FICO scores are, the more history they have, it gives us greater confidence in being able to extend somewhat bigger lines. So I think both initial lines for new accounts, as well as line increases done to the right segments can be very profitable and can be done without driving up charge-offs. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is now open. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Good afternoon. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : I just want to ask questions around your expectation on the BSA/AML cost for 2016, how we should think about that. It looks like it came in just shy of $100 million for 2015. Is that a fair level that we should assume for 2016? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would say no. I would not assume that as a level for 2016. The number we've been calling out for BSA/AML compliance we specifically identified as a project, right? This is a look back on transactions over a period of time historically. And it's got a finite end date and a finite process it runs. So that definitely bleeds off as we go into 2016, and the cost of that is included in the expense guidance that we gave earlier. So we are considering the lingering effects of that as we look at the remainder of this year. What I would say is there are obviously ongoing costs associated with the BSA/AML program enhancements. Those we have largely been covering with either run rate operating efficiencies that we have found to-date and we'll look to find ways to offset those expenses as we move forward, but they are fractions, very small fractions of the total number we're talking about around the project. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Okay. And then just to reconfirm that expectation for the BSA/AML cost, that is included in your 2016 expense projection of $3.5 billion, correct? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It is included in it, yes. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Okay. All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Mark, I just wanted to quickly clarify or rather maybe make sure I've understood your expectations around allowance. It sounds like what you expect to pursue is that the allowance will grow roughly in line with projected loan growth. Is that correct? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, so the allowance will respond to what we actually see as trends in the portfolio. Based on what we see now though, we continue to believe provision increases will be largely driven by and in line with loan portfolio growth. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. And so from that perspective, just mathematically, it would continue to be in the range of 2.6% to 2.7% of card loans? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It would depend on the size of the new vintage, right? If you had a meteoric increase in the size of a vintage, that could impact it, but generally speaking, I think that's a reasonable proxy for looking at the stability of the credit environment. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks very much. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays. Your line is now open. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Just another follow-up on that point, because I think obviously I have some confusion on your comments, Mark, because when you say reserving at kind of 2.6%, 2.7% level, and they have been kind of consistently there for the last four quarters, you are referring to the reserves per loans as opposed to the provisions per loans, because provisions per loans really have bounced around a lot. And they were 2.7% this quarter, but if we look at a world where you are guiding to charge-offs in the low 2%s, and we are now at 2.7% on a reserve to loan ratio, would that imply that, at least with absent really strong loan growth, that the provision to loan should be lower in the coming quarters than they were this quarter? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So what we're specifically calling out with that number is the reserve rate for cards that we disclosed in our financial supplement. So it's just bounced around. I'm looking back, December of 2014, it was 2.63%; 2.79% in March of 2015; 2.62% in June; 2.62% in September; 2.68% now. So it's pretty consistently in that 2.6%, 2.7% range. I would tell you based on the seasoning of the growth we've put on the books over the course of the last couple years as well as the challenge that David has put in front of the team to accelerate loan growth as we go into this year as well, I would not expect the provisions to decrease. By the same token, I would very clearly state so that I'm not misunderstood, don't expect some giant increase in that card reserve rates right now, based on what we currently see in our models. That obviously changes, but if you think about it, Mark, the next six months are pretty well known, right? So we're reserving for 12 months out. The next six months we can pretty well see in the role buckets. It's really that period of 6 months to 12 months out where you've got a little bit of uncertainty, where your models get impacted to a degree by the macro variables and your assessment of the health and the strength of the economy and what that's going to do to a borrower. So there's always a little bit of uncertainty in this. It is a forecast, so by definition, it's wrong. You try and be as right as you can. We're thumping along the bottom of the credit cycle. We have been for a while. So there will be a little bit of volatility here. But, what I always just try to remind everybody is this is a $1.8 billion balance sheet item. So, a little bit of volatility drives some moves in EPS. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Donat of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open. Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. David, I just wanted to ask on the secured credit card and your launch of that, you're typically very methodical about new products and I imagine this has been in development for some time. Can you give us some color on what sort of development process you went through and what you might have considered adding or not adding with the card or just trying to understand when you guys launch something, I know you put a lot of investment into it, so what you're getting for it. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, and this has been in test for a while. So we have experience with some accounts and we got to the point where we had enough experience that we felt that we could make it an official launch. And I would say we're certainly seeing in the marketplace right now people that are in the \u2013 lesser credits are seeing significant growth, and the prime market is really not growing hardly at all. And so we're not willing to sacrifice our credit to go into subprime, but what this product allows us to do is to get people that might currently be considered subprime to get our product and for us to be protected from losses because we have the security deposit and to work with those customers to graduate them into prime loans when they're ready. And so it is our way of new to credit or blemished credit in a way that protects our losses. And so I guess the final thing I'd say is we did a lot of market research looking at competitive products, and we don't see anything in the marketplace that is like this. Most other cards are stripped down cards. They don't have rewards. They don't have benefits. They service the cards offshore. This is a real Discover it card with everything that comes with it. And the only thing unique is it's fully secured, and so when the credit improves, they continue that product, but it becomes unsecured. Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. And then just related to that you said you're seeing more opportunity with the subprime side and certainly we see from other card issuers some pretty dramatic growth in loan balances in the subprime category. But are you seeing changes in consumer behavior? Like, I hear anecdotes of millennials not embracing credit cards the same way that, say, baby boomers did. Is that any part of the thesis here or is that just in the background? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's probably a component, because new to credit is part of it, and we are seeing a few more people that aren't establishing credit early on. And so they may need to start out with a secured card just because they just didn't get any credit, didn't get a credit history. So this helps address that need. A lot of what's happening, though, is the big bounce back, in my opinion, in the subprime market because I think that declined far more a few years ago than the prime did even. And there were very few competitors in it, and now the very few people who are in subprime still, including the private labels that tend to have high yields and lower credits, are seeing a big bounce back. But it's a smaller segment than the prime segment. I think the more important thing for us is to gain share in prime, but what we want to do is identify the people that can become prime over time and get them started before they're all the way there to prime. Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Got it. Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Hecht of Jefferies. Your line is now open. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I'll ask one about margin. You're guiding for a flat margin. Is that just I guess you're not anticipating many rate hikes this year, or is there something else going on with the trajectory of rates, yields and cost to fund that we should think about? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So we are working off of an operative assumption of one or two rate increases this year as opposed to the four we were looking at in the forward curve toward the very end of last year. I would say we have not yet seen the benefit really of repricing in the card book fully from the Fed rate increase because we don't reprice card customers until cycle date. So you will get some lift from that coming in. So I think what we're trying to say in NIM is there's an upward bias in NIM. We're well positioned right now. We may choose to invest some of that increase in NIM in marketing dollars, some promotional dollars and other places to really drive the growth that I think is the key thing we understand the market wants to see from us. So we may take some of that excess and reinvest it. Absent doing that, you would have more NIM expansion than you're likely to actually see. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And separate and distinct question. You did speak to the typical trajectory of your prime accounts and the utilization rates, but just looking at your Master Trust data, you've had elevated payment rates for some time. And I'm wondering if you can speak to kind of just generic changes you see in customer utilization or payment behaviors or is there something that's changed you think that's going to take a while to shift or that's, I guess, worthy of discussion? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I would just say that the mix between balance transfer and sales can impact payment rates along with credit. And so certainly credit is great and so that tends to relate to a bit higher payments rates than one would otherwise have. But as we have shifted to a little more transaction volume turning into loans versus a little less balance transfer on new accounts that is going to impact the payment rates. And so people will tend to pay more of their sales down than they will of their balance transfer down. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : And so based on the, I guess, current marketing strategy, the elevated payment stream, do you think that stays around for a while or would we see that shift? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think that we're forecasting a big change in that relationship. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Henry Coffey of Sterne, Agee. Your line is now open. Henry J. Coffey - CRT Capital Group LLC : Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. Mark, when you look at some of the one-time expense items outside of the AML/BSA spending this year and last and some of the changes \u2013 you've closed down the mortgage company and then, of course, you sold off Italy. Can you give us a sense of sort of what the net impact of those two developments were? I mean, I know revenue goes down from those two, but so does some cost. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, I think, Henry, some of the one-time expenses or some of the revenue reductions you see in the fee line actually are accretive to the P&L, right? So, for example, we called out $74 million in lost revenue next year from the mortgage business. I'd remind everybody when we exited the mortgage business, we said the reason we were doing it or one of the reasons we were doing it is it was not P&L accretive, right. So I think that's a very good point there. If I think about the expense base generally right now, I think we are very lean. We are very efficient today, as evidenced by that efficiency ratio. We are always looking to find further efficiencies to get operating synergies and drive even greater returns on that. As I said earlier, we do have some levers we can pull, if we get there, but I think those are the kind of levers you pull when you are in a turn in the credit cycle and you see things. Right now, we're still trying to drive growth, right. And I don't think you drive growth by kind of coming in and trying to whack the heck out of expenses, especially when you are already as efficient on that as we are. So we're trying to balance prudent investments in growth, maybe investing some of this additional NIM, to drive that going forward. Henry J. Coffey - CRT Capital Group LLC : In the Payment Services business, on the international front, Diners card has gone through a lot of change, including the sale of Italy. What is the outlook there? And thank you for answering my questions. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Well, I feel like we have really stabilized and positioned Diners to be able to grow from this point forward. And apart from FX rates, we saw some healthy growth, some of the best growth we've seen since we owned it. I think that Citi has largely exited the franchisees that they were going to exit. We've gotten franchisees into new hands, some very strong bank partners in China, India, and Japan, and we've dramatically increased acceptance across the world. So Diners is a pretty small total volume but the trajectory, I think, looks much better now. And certainly, selling Italy, I think positions us much better from a P&L perspective. And the final thing I would add, since Italy came up in the last question as well, I think we exited Italy. We took the hard decisions on the mortgage business to really position ourselves for the future. And so I feel like we had some one-times last year. I think they were relatively small, the total $3.5 billion spend, compared to some other companies, but we prefer to have even fewer and I think we've positioned ourselves, knock on wood, to have fewer going forward, especially as we get through this look-back. So I gave you two answers for the price of one question. Henry J. Coffey - CRT Capital Group LLC : Thank you very much, sir. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Harbes of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just drilling down on the expenses, were there any other one-timers aside from the BSA look-back? The other expense line looked a little bit elevated and I was kind of expecting a little bit of a decline potentially from the liability shift from EMV. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I like that there was a little bit of elevated fraud cost in the fourth quarter... David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And a little EMV cost. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And a little bit of EMV cost. So I think as you continue to push the cards out, there's costs associated with that. On the flip side of the equation, I think the fraud was actually up a little bit, as you have the fraudsters trying to getting that one last hit before while swiping is still very prevalent. So I think there's a combination of both sides of the same coin that you're seeing show up in that line item. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Remember on EMV, the rollout for the industry is still in-process. There's a lot of retailers that haven't put it in, activated it yet. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And as a follow-up, can you guys give us an update on how the Cashback Checking is progressing. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. We continue to purely offer that through cross-sell. We achieved the targets that we set internally for the product last year just with the cross-sell, and it is my hope that by year-end we will finally be able to make it available more broadly, but we continue to enhance the operations, the functionality, the controls around AML/BSA and fraud, and we have continued to learn a lot. And I think that one of the reasons we've taken longer to launch this one than others is because it is a very important and more complicated product than typical products out there. So we want to wait to go abroad until we are all buttoned down. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair. Your line is now open. Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon. The personal loan business, the reserve was up quite a bit in personal loans and a little bit of increase in charge-offs and delinquencies. And the growth rate also continued to slow. Is it the competitive environment in personal loans? Are you incrementally concerned about credit in that business? And with the competitive environment, with the lending (1:05:52), do you expect that to at some point over the next year or so that there's going to be something that's going to derail some of those rapidly growing Internet competitors? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'll tackle the reserving question and David can tackle the strategic element of the question. I would say, Bob, what's driving it really is seasoning of the portfolio, right. I mean, I think you've seen double-digit growth rates there over the course of a number of years. Personal loans don't season radically differently than credit card loans do. There's a little bit of a change in the shape of the curve and it's not exactly the same, but they tend to season after origination. You don't get a lot of first payment defaults when you do it prudently, thankfully. So I would say it's just seasoning. Don't expect any major deterioration of any kind in that portfolio and the seasoning we are seeing is in line with expectations. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And what I would say on the strategic side is we had record originations this year in that business, even with literally hundreds of marketplace competitors entering and vying for share. And I think that part of the reason is that the people that we're targeting tend to be very different than the credits that most of those are targeting. Our average FICO score is 750, 760. The figures I've seen from the leading companies in the marketplace space is sub-700 average. And when every 20 points of FICO means a doubling of credit losses that is a very big difference in target market. And so we think that we're still the leader in prime originations in the space. In terms of whether there will be a shake out, I'm sure there will be a shake out. I'm sure some people will survive, but I don't think that there will be hundreds of competitors. And it is an unproven model through the cycle. And I believe that our model of originating and holding versus just an originate and sale that relies solely on growth, and if you stop originating you don't have revenue, I believe that a relationship, owning the credits, being able to finance it on our balance sheet and not having to rely on securitization markets that we have seen can completely dry up in a crisis I think is a more sustainable model. And so I really like our position in that business. Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. And then my follow-up question, just in the spirit of trying to accelerate growth, just any thoughts on the trends in the student loan business? And then how the Ariba partnership is going and if that can be a material driver, how long does it take? Or could that business ever be a material driver of revenue growth and earnings growth? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, answering your third question, I guess, first, we think that Ariba is going to continue to produce a lot of volume growth in the short term. It will be a while before it becomes a material contributor profitability-wise. We also think there may be some ancillary services that may provide some revenues that having that product we're working on adding some additional functionality that may produce some revenue potential. On student loans, I'm not sure I fully understood your question on the student loans. Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Just on the growth rate outlook for that business, do you expect to see steady trends, or is there anything you're working on to accelerate growth in the student loan business or...? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, I think... Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Or are there any things that are concerning that would slow it down from a regulatory standpoint or otherwise? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, I expect to originate more this year than we did last year. But I don't expect a dramatic acceleration, but I do think that the credit trends look great, the needs continue from customers, and I expect us to originate a bit more. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Bob, it is helpful to look at the organic book versus the acquired book, because the acquired we bought a number of years ago is essentially in run-off. Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Franklin for final remarks. Bill Franklin - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us. If you have any other follow-up questions, feel free to call Investor Relations. Have a good night. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great evening.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Discover Financial Services First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Bill Franklin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Bill Franklin : Thank you, Connor. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin, as always, with slide two of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of Discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC today in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs, which are on our website and on file with the SEC. In the first quarter 2016 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A period, it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question, so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated. So, now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David. David Nelms : Thanks Bill, and welcome, all of you, to our call. For the first quarter, we delivered net income of $575 million, earnings per share of $1.35, and a return on equity of 21%. Our direct banking business continues to deliver solid results. Discover achieved total loan growth of 4% over the prior year, which now brings us into the lower end of our targeted range for 2016. Specifically, we grew card receivables by 4%, accelerating year-over-year growth versus the fourth quarter. This receivables growth was the result of more new accounts and slightly higher customer spending and borrowing on cards, as our overall revolver mix for the portfolio increased. Our brand, rewards and overall value proposition remained focused on the prime revolver segment, which we believe is the most profitable part of the card market. Card sales grew by 4% over the prior year. Excluding the impact of gas prices, sales were up approximately 6%, which shows that the lower gas prices at the pump remain a drag on card sales. Also, I'll point out that leap year in the first quarter added roughly 1% to sales growth. Last quarter, we were recognized as highest in customer loyalty in the annual Brand Keys' survey. This marks the 20th consecutive year that we've earned the top spot. I believe our focus on the customer has allowed us to have some of the lowest attrition rates in the industry and will continue to allow us to grow loans profitably. Our other lending products are performing well. The organic student loan portfolio increased 15% and personal loans grew 9% over the prior year. The strong organic student loan growth was driven by disbursements related to students going back to school for the second semester and our continued focus on increasing awareness of Discover student loans. On the funding side, I'm very pleased with the 6% sequential increase in direct-to-consumer deposits. Our consumer deposits grew approximately $2 billion and made up 45% of funding at the quarter end. We captured the growth as investments in marketing over the last several months delivered positive results, specifically in savings accounts and balances. Moving to our payments business, total volume for the segment declined, as increases in network partners and Diner's Club volume were offset by year-over-year declines in debit volume at PULSE. We believe PULSE volumes will stabilize at approximately current levels for the remainder of the year. Lastly, in payments, we continue to leverage our proprietary network to deliver great returns in our card issuing business and are pleased with the increasing domestic and global acceptance. Overall, it was a good quarter and we're making progress against our key focus areas for the year. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark and he'll walk you through the details of our first quarter financial results. Mark Graf : Thanks David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by going through the revenue detail on slide five of our earnings presentation. Net interest income increased $121 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total non-interest income decreased $68 million to $474 million. The prior year's results included $42 million in mortgage origination revenue, a category that is absent this year as we subsequently exited the business. Net discount and interchange revenue was up 2%, driven by increased sales, partially offset by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 106 basis points, up four basis points over the prior year due to higher promotional and standard rewards. Sequentially, the rewards rate was down 12 basis points. The fourth quarter typically represents a seasonal high and also included the Apple Pay rewards bonus. Protection products revenue declined $10 million, as new product sales remain suspended. Sequentially, protection products revenue was relatively flat; however, we continue to expect some runoff this year. Moving to payment services, revenue decreased $6 million from the prior year, mainly due to the previously announced loss of volume from a third-party issuer. Overall, we grew total company net revenues by 2% for the quarter. Turning to slide six, total loan yield of 11.69% was 32 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 37 basis point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in yield was primarily due to a higher percentage of revolving card receivables in the portfolio, as well as the impact of the prime rate increase in December. On the funding side, we grew average direct-to-consumer deposits 9% and we've completed two ABS deals year-to-date. Funding costs increased only eight basis points, partly as a result of fixed rate debt issuances in the last year muting the impact of rising rates. Overall, net interest margin expanded 25 basis points from the prior year to 9.94%. We achieved good acceleration in card loan growth through stronger sales and an increased revolve rate, so we did not feel a need to increase our promotional mix during the quarter. However, looking forward, we may yet choose to invest some of this NIM benefit to drive continued loan growth. Turning to slide seven, operating expenses were up $13 million over the prior year. Last year's results included $37 million in expense associated with the direct mortgage origination business, more than half of which was reflected in employee compensation. The $14 million year-over-year increase in total employee compensation you see in the table was driven primarily by higher headcount to support compliance activities, as well as annual merit increases. Marketing expenses decreased $20 million, due in part to the timing of card marketing, as well as the elimination of mortgage marketing activities. Professional fees increased $33 million to $160 million, as expenses associated with the AML/BSA look back project totaled approximately $30 million for the quarters. We expect the look back project costs to be largely complete in the first half of this year. And finally, other expense was lower, as the prior year included a $20 million addition to the legal reserve. This quarter, our total company efficiency ratio was about 40%. However, if you exclude the $30 million look back project expense I mentioned a moment ago, total company efficiency ratio was roughly 38.5%. Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on slide eight, provision for loan losses was higher by $34 million compared to the prior year, due to higher reserves and charge-offs, primarily driven by loan growth. This quarter we increased reserves $52 million, while last year we had a $30 million reserve build. The credit card net charge-off rate of 2.34% decreased by six basis points year-over-year and increased 16 basis points sequentially. The 30 plus day delinquency rate of 1.68% increased four basis points year-over-year and was down four basis points sequentially. On balance, the credit backdrop continues to remain benign and reserving continues to be driven primarily by the compounding effect of several years of consistent loan growth, a meaningful portion of which has come from new accounts. Moving to private student loans, the net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, decreased 18 basis points from the prior year, benefiting from the benign credit environment, as well as a couple of items that we've discussed in the past, specifically, more effective collection strategies, as well as the introduction of several new payment plans over the last year. Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, increased 26 basis points to 1.92%, as a larger portion of the portfolio continues to come into repayment. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations. Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was up 23 basis points from the prior year and the over 30 day delinquency rate was up 21 basis points to 97 basis points. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were primarily driven by the expected seasoning of recent loan growth. Next, I'll touch on our capital position on slide nine. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased sequentially by 30 basis points to 14.2%, due to the seasonal decline in loan balances from the fourth quarter. This ratio declined 50 basis points from the prior year, due to capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks, and dividends. In the quarter, we again repurchased nearly 2% of our common stock. Lastly, while we did not recognize any material tax benefits this period, there will be a favorable resolution to an outstanding tax matter which will have the one-time effect of lowering the effective tax rate for the second quarter. In summary, it feels like a good start to the year, with a strong margin and good loan growth and a continued benign credit environment. We expect to see provisioning driven by loan growth and will continue to work diligently to manage the core expense base as we absorb increasing regulatory and compliance costs. That concludes our formal remarks. So, now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Connor, to open the line up for Q&A. Connor? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Good afternoon. Just had a question on the revolve rate. Was wondering if you could just talk about what drove that higher. Was it something that you guys were doing, or was it just a broader consumer trend? Obviously, kind of, in this market, people are jittery about the macro. Any comments on the macro would be helpful as well. Thank you. Mark Graf : Sanjay, it's Mark, I'll let David pile on as well here, but I think the revolve rate was really driven by a continued focus on the revolver in our book. And I think, as we telegraphed on the last -- on the call last quarter, over the course of last year, we pulled back a number of activities that weren't driving the kinds of behavior that we wanted to see in the book and had refocused our efforts really along some of the more traditional areas where we had emphasized growth in the portfolio and that's paid very significant dividends over the course of the last quarter. I would say it's paid dividends not only in the form of growth from balances from new accounts, but also growth in formerly dormant accounts that have reactivated also showed good contribution to growth in that regard. David Nelms : And the only thing I would add is we have been talking about the continued impact of gas prices on sales and that has much less of an impact on loans and has the effect of helping the revolve rate a bit. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And any comments, David, on just the state of the consumer or on the macro? David Nelms : I think it continues to be steady, but slow growth. And we're seeing sales continue to kind of bump along, increasing from last year. But the consumers are continuing to be cautious and that is -- that makes it tough on the sales line, but is certainly benefiting the credit line where the caution is showing up in continuing great credit results. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is open. John Hecht : Thanks very much, guys. Real quick, Mark, can you quantify the tax benefit in Q2 just so we have a fair model perspective? Mark Graf : Yeah, I would say with respect to tax benefit, it relates to a matter that's disclosed in our SEC filings. It's the OID treatment of cashback bonus. It's for an extended period from 1999 to 2007, and it's a pretty complex matter over a number of years, so we are still in the process of putting a fine point on it. I guess what I would say is on the tax line itself, it looks to be kind of a mid-8 figure kind of number in the quarter that we would indeed recognize. So I think that probably gives you a good triangulation for how to think about it. John Hecht : Okay. Thanks very much. And then second question, you got a little bit better margin expansion than we expected from rising prime rate. Is all that priced in the portfolio, or is there some kind of residual upside as we stretch into the second quarter? Mark Graf : No, I think it really relates to, we talked on the last call about a natural upward bias in the NIM in the book and that we thought it might lean more heavily into promotional activity. We didn't end up doing that, as it turned out, because we saw growth reaccelerating along the lines of what we hoping for from a cadence perspective. So I think I would say, as you look forward over this year, I would kind of discourage you from flattening NIM out and just saying, this is where it will be for the rest of the year. I think there would be relative stability in NIM, but it could be affected by promotional activity, that revolving behavior Sanjay asked about a second ago, and obviously, any further moves the Fed makes, because of that positive bias in positioning. John Hecht : Okay. Appreciate the details. Thanks very much. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Ryan Nash : Good afternoon, everyone. David, just following up on one of the questions that Sanjay asked about, could you maybe just talk about how the efforts to accelerate loan growth are going? Last quarter, you laid out a handful of initiatives. I was wondering if you could share how they are going, maybe any other metrics you have, account openings, activations, to help us understand what the pipeline could look like for loan growth for the rest of the year. David Nelms : Sure. Well, I think that the best indicator that our efforts are working in total is just to look at actual loan growth. And so we accelerated from just over 3% to about 4% year-over-year. And as you know, we had just established a new higher 4% to 6% full-year target, also for total loan growth, also for long-term, to be in that target. So I'm pleased at all of our various actions have moved us into that lower end of the range, and we're certainly taking efforts to continue to move higher in that range, if we're able to, later this year. And I'd say those efforts include, I mentioned more new accounts. We are continuing to look for places where we can appropriately increase credit lines or extend credit where we expect good and are achieving good results. Also, some of our new features have been well received, whether it's some of our cash back, Freeze It, continued great take-up of free FICO scores. So I'd say that we have -- I don't think there's a single home run kind of initiative for loan growth, but a whole lot of singles that we are working on across the franchise. Mark Graf : And Ryan, I' add on to that, just quickly, the loan growth continues to be close to 50/50 new accounts, as well as existing accounts, which is a really healthy way to see that loan growth coming in. And if you look at the $2.2 billion in card receivables growth over the course of the last year, over 80% of that is coming in what I'll call the standard merchandise bucket, customers just simply using their cards, exhibiting the behaviors that drive the kind of long-term profitability we want to see out of the book. Ryan Nash : Got it. Mark Graf : So it feels very good. Ryan Nash : Maybe I could just ask one other question, just on credit. If I look this quarter, charge-offs were relatively stable. Delinquencies were relatively stable, up a couple basis points. I was wondering how do we think about the puts and takes. And Mark, more specifically, since last quarter there was a wide range on outcomes for reserves for 1Q, could you help us how to think about the pace of reserve builds from here, just given there was a release in the second quarter last year. I don't think you're anticipating a reserve release this time. Just want to understand how we should think about reserve builds from here. Mark Graf : Yes, so Ryan, happy to. I think from my perspective, the $50 million or so we built this quarter, I continue to describe that as essentially noise on a $1.9 billion balance sheet item. It's never going to be exactly flat. It's always going to be bumping along a little bit one way or the other. I would say provisioning from this point forward is going to continue to be a factor of loan growth and the seasoning of that loan growth. I would not encourage anyone to expect a reserve release in the second quarter. By the same token, I would not encourage anyone to assume there's going to be some giant take-off in provisioning in the second quarter, either. It feels, again, it's going to be very much a function of loan growth and the seasoning of that loan growth, and it feels like we're in a good general band. Ryan Nash : Thanks for taking my questions. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Henry Coffey with Sterne Agee. Your line is open. Henry Coffey : Yes, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. When you look at the network side of the business, obviously Diner's Club has started to show some positive life and your expenses were lower. What are the next steps forward there? David Nelms : Well, I think I am pleased with the growth that you acknowledged in Diner's Club, as some of our new partners that have come online in recent years in places like China and other areas start to grow more robustly, and same with network partners, with the volume up very nicely as other networks around the world increasingly coming online and using our network for global acceptance. And I'd say the headwind has been quite severe in the largest segment, which is PULSE. And as I mentioned in my comments, after several years of a downdraft following the [Indiscernible] and paved actions that Visa took, as well as loss of one major customer, it feels like we have reached a plateau with PULSE, and I think after this year what we're looking to do is to go back to growing PULSE. And we had a bunch of years of very robust growth in market share and volume in PULSE, up until the actions shortly after Durbin, Amendment went in. And we're working to have that grow, as well, while maintaining those newer areas like Diner's and network partners and AribaPay, where we're seeing nice growth add-on, as well. Henry Coffey : Great. And then on the overhead side of the equation, Mark, when does the AML/BSA, when do those extra expenses dwindle away? Mark Graf : So Henry, I'd put it in two buckets. The look-back project that we continue to call out specifically, I think we see that, in terms of dollars of spend, largely drawing to a close next quarter, at this point in time. So I think we can say that piece is close to being done with the case work. I think the other piece of AML/BSA is really what I would call building out the AML/BSA process within the organization. We're largely covering a lot of that increased expense through finding efficiencies elsewhere in the business model. So I'd take you back to second of my prepared remarks where I said roughly a 40% efficiency ratio all-in. But if you exclude that look-back that we expect to bleed off after next quarter, we're printing about a 38.5% efficiency ratio this quarter. Now I think expenses are never flat. I think next quarter they may be inflated a little bit as we bring some things across the goal line and all. But I would stand by the expense guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. Henry Coffey : Great. And congratulations on a good quarter. Thank you. Mark Graf : Thanks, Henry. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Christopher Donat : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to explore on the personal loans business, because we've seen the deceleration of the growth there over the last couple of years and some of that's coincided with the entrance of the marketplace lenders or peer-to-peer lenders. Are you seeing any changes in the competitive landscape there? And would you have any hopes of getting the loan growth back up into the double digits in the coming year or so? David Nelms : Well, I would encourage you to look at the dollars of loan growth, which last year was an all-time record for growth in our personal loan business. And we continue to grow that very nicely and there was -- the only thing that's really changed is the denominator is getting bigger. So, percentage is dropping because of the denominator, even as the dollars of originations have gotten bigger. So I wouldn't cite market entrants or competition as being the slowdown. I think going forward we do think our model is more sustainable, since it's going on our balance sheet. We have long-term customer relationships. We are profitable, in contrast to some of the competitors who are printing some more difficult headlines right now. And so I think we have a very sustainable business model that we continue to grow, we think, well and appropriately. Christopher Donat : Okay. And just on the marketing side, I guess there were some timing issues that Mark had commented on. So it's down 11% year-on-year. Would you expect, Mark, it to be more flat year-on-year going forward, or even up, or is it just, are we in the ballpark in terms of year-on-year comparisons from here? Mark Graf : So, I guess what I'd say is we're continuing to really manage the interplay between marketing spend, as well as rewards rate. And as we're leaning a little bit more into rewards rate, with our double new account promotion and some of the other things we're doing, I think we're viewing that as interchangeable with the market spend. So to some degree, some of the decline in marketing spend you see is related to that. The other thing I would say is there's obviously some timing of spend, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that occurs throughout the course of the year. The first quarter was not a particularly high point, from a marketing spend standpoint. And then the other thing I would just point out is in the year-over-year comparison, we did have the mortgage marketing spend in there last year, which I would remind you, you kind of have to peel back out for comparability. Those would really be the bits and pieces, puts and takes. I think ultimately, we continue to have a very disciplined approach to marketing spend. We want to make sure we're getting the results we see for it. Again, when we saw we weren't getting some of the results we were looking for through some of the listing sites and other channels last year in the middle of the year, we pulled back on those, because we want to make sure we're driving the kind of growth that's going to drive the right kind of long-term profitability. Christopher Donat : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Your line is open. Donald Fandetti : Yes, Mark, can you talk a little bit about the rewards being so low this quarter and how you're thinking about that in context of the full-year guidance? And then maybe provide a little bit of color on your thoughts about the industry in general on rewards. We're starting to see some pretty high offers, in the 5% range. Want to get your updated thoughts there. Mark Graf : So, I'll tackle the rate and dollar questions, then I'll let David talk about the industry trend. I guess what I would say is we're still very comfortable with the full-year rewards rate at 115 basis points. Couple things to think about there. Number one, we are going to continue running our double rewards program for new accounts, at least for the next quarter and maybe beyond. And I would say from the standpoint of the rewards perspective, it is down a little bit from where we were in the fourth quarter, but there's generally a peak seasonality effect in the fourth quarter. And in addition, the fourth quarter was elevated because of Apple Pay and the special promotion we ran in the most recent fourth quarter. So, I think we're up about 4 basis points year-over-year in terms of rewards rates. So that 115 on a full-year basis still feels like a good place to triangulate. David Nelms : And I would just say that it's no surprise that competitors are aggressively offering cash rewards programs, because it's what consumers most want and it's just very attractive to consumers. And I think that we are in a -- we've been at this game for 30 years now -- and I think our combination of 1% cash back, 5% rotating categories, additional value coming from our network partners who add value that doesn't hit our expense line, the elimination of breakage on the back end that we put in place a year ago, consumers still tell us that regardless of topline headline numbers, most consumers, we think, really like our program. And we think we have the right balance between sustainable cost and great value to consumers. Donald Fandetti : So, David, you don't see -- you're not sensing a big step forward in terms of accelerated reward offers. It's more of just a continued, steady competitive environment? David Nelms : I think so. I think it accelerated a few years back. Since that time, the competitors have swapped between years. Two years ago, there was one competitor was heavy. They kind of pulled back, then another one came in. And so I think we're at a fairly steady state, which is an intense environment, but I don't really see it getting worse from here. And the history of the industry has been when people have something that seems unsustainable, they eventually peel it back. But my guess is when some of those competitors peel back, someone else will enter the fray. So we're competing as if this is going to be the -- we think it's the steady state, a lot of competition and we have to win this game. Donald Fandetti : Thank you. Mark Graf : From a value perspective and profit perspective. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. David Ho : Good afternoon. I just wanted to follow up on credit. Have you seen any, on the margin credit deterioration, related to energy or even some of your lower FICO customers? And a follow-up on that would be, would credit deterioration potentially come from some of your competitors increasing credit lines or just loosening that up over time? Mark Graf : David, it's Mark, I'll take the first stab and David can pile on. I would say with respect to the energy-related part of the question, we have seen some deterioration in the energy-related states, but I would describe it really as prior to the significant drop in oil prices, all of those markets were performing better than the national average for our portfolio. They've basically come down to the national average for our portfolio. So it's something we're watching very closely, but it's not something that currently gives us significant pause or concern. All the credit metrics we're watching in the portfolio really speak to a continued benign environment with, again, as I said earlier, reserving from here really more a function of loan growth. David, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that. David Nelms : No, I agree. I think in general, I think about energy exposure as being business loan-related, which we're not in. And I think on the consumer side, it certainly has to have an impact. Any time there's loss of jobs or income in the industry, it affects consumers. But even with the high percentage reductions in employment in that industry, it's just not that huge of a number on a national level, since we're completely national in scope. It's not going to be, as an example, like the mortgage that hit lots of consumers nationally. This is a pretty localized impact. David Ho : Okay. And then are you seeing, or potentially expecting any pressure from more credit lines being offered by competitors? I mean, servicing ratios have kind of stayed flat. Mortgage debt has been replaced by a little bit on the consumer side in terms of leverage, so, any thoughts there? David Nelms : Well, I think that, I think that there may be less -- if rates slowly rise, there's probably a little bit less refinancing that will go on, particularly in first mortgages. And -- but I don't see, I don't see a big impact in the near term. I think we're in a fairly steady state in terms of the credit card industry growing at a slow rate. Mark Graf : Consumer balance sheets still seem like they are in pretty good shape, David. When you just look at the obligation ratios and when you look at the debt burden that they are carrying, it's a very different scenario now than it was the last time we were at this point in the cycle, so not dissuading you from your belief that we are in a cyclical business we are, but it just feels like the consumer debt burden is still fairly -- really manageable at this point. David Ho : Okay. Thanks Mark. One more question on the interchange relative to volumes. Interchange fees look like they rose 5% versus volumes closer to 4%, a little bit of a higher margin there. Is that just one-time, or is that mix shift, or how do you see that? Mark Graf : It's really more a function of spend mix. The fourth quarter tends to see a lot of Big-Box spending around the holiday period and in the first quarter; you tend to see a higher percentage of the mix being smaller merchants. So it's really more mix-driven than anything else, David. David Ho : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good afternoon. Wanted to just ask on expenses, the other expense line came in later than expected, down quite a bit. Just wanted to get the color around that line item. Mark Graf : The real big driver in other expense is in the similar quarter. Last year we had a $20 million addition to the legal reserve that was absent this quarter. Beyond that, I would say it's just generally back to what I said earlier, that focus on if you exclude the MLBSA look-back, really trying to find ways to look at the expenses that are creeping into the model from a regulatory and compliance standpoint, making sure we're finding efficiencies and ways to cover those. So I think it reflects the discipline on that front, coupled with the lack of the $20 million addition to the legal reserve. John Pancari : Right. So therefore, I'm getting noise on my line here. Sorry. So, basically that 100 million, or that 107 appears sustainable at this level? Mark Graf : Yes, again, I would say expenses do tend to bounce around quarter over quarter. I wouldn't specifically encourage you to cycle to the 107. I think what I would say is we've given guidance for total expenses, really being slightly north of $3.5 billion for the year, I think is how we described it back on the fourth quarter call. We'll stand by that guidance and I think I'll stand by the earlier comments on the other line as well. John Pancari : Okay, then one more. On the card yield, up quite a bit year-over-year, 37 basis points, up 22 link quarter. I know it's a function of both higher rates in terms of fed move, but also the mix. Can you just talk to us about how we should think about that going forward in terms of the magnitude of incremental upside we could see there as mix evolves? Mark Graf : Yes, I think what I would say is you now have the prime rate increase is already priced into the portfolio, right? I would say that's there. Obviously, further prime rate increases would potentially have a bearing on it, but assuming the prime rate stays where the prime rate is, I think that whole benefits baked in. The other part of it is a much higher component of revolving balances in the portfolio, right, due to the real strong focus on the revolving consumer. And the success we've had there, I would say given what's happened to revolve rate, I wouldn't expect really significant increases in revolve rates from here. So from that perspective, I would go back and just generally say if you think about it in a NIM perspective as opposed to specifically a card yield perspective, it feels like you would have, you know, I'll call it again a relatively stable NIM from this level, but you would have some diminution over the course of a year in a stable environment. But again, I would point out that it could be impacted by we still may make a decision to do a little promotional investment that would have a muting impact there. The revolve rate would have an impact. And again, further prime rate increases would have an impact as well. John Pancari : Okay, helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is open. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good afternoon. I had a couple of questions on CCAR. First, relating to last year's, is it reasonable to assume that you guys would seek to max out, I think it was the $2.2 billion authorization you received last year, which I think would imply about 480 million of buyback in the next quarter. And then separately, relating to the upcoming CCAR, broadly speaking and certainly at a high level, is it reasonable to expect that you guys are continuing to accrete capital to consumers in good health? We've got unemployment rate at the same level, although the starting point is a little bit lower, so the delta is higher. But you put all the pieces together. Would it be reasonable to assume that you kind of continue to grind closer to 100% payout ratio rather than move farther away from it? Mark Graf : So if I think about CCAR -- I'll parse out. There's a bunch of questions. I'll try to touch them all. If I miss one, come back with your follow-up. I think with respect to repurchase cadence, we've never given any specific guidance on that front. But I would just kind of say I would expect -- I wouldn't see any reason to expect a radically dissimilar cadence in 2Q, to kind of what you've seen, would be the way I would think about it. In terms of the overall approach how we think about it, I would say over the last couple years we continue to make what I have described as prudently aggressive asks and every year they have been slightly more aggressive. I would assume that a reasonable person should assume that we don't see any reason to change that. We recognize we have excess capital today. And we are working diligently within the confines of the CCAR process to be able to return as much of that as prudently possible. David Nelms : And I might just add on, I think typically we've seen the last few years the fed scenarios getting tougher, not easier, which impacts, but also as our processes have matured and there's greater comfort, we have continued to move into a position of actually working towards our targeted levels. And you've seen our capital. You see our capital ratios today a bit lower than they were last year. We bought back almost 8% of our stock in the last year and every year we would love it to move a little more quickly towards the target levels and every year we're trying to take steps to do that. But we also, know we just can't get to the target. We won't get approval to get to the target in one fell swoop. Mark Graf : Think about it as a constrained optimization, drove a total yield last year a total of 10% between dividends and buybacks. So we feel like we're being respectful of our shareholders capital and being prudently aggressive in our asks. Again, the cadence having more aggressive every year I think a reasonable person would assume we wouldn't see a meaningful reason to change that cadence. Bill Carcache : Understood, extremely helpful. Thank you. If I may squeeze one more in on expenses. Just for clarification Mark? I believe that you had said earlier that the look-back project was drawing to a close next quarter. Should we interpret that to mean that there will be one more quarter with the non-recurring BSA ML cost that would result in a differential between the operating efficiency and the adjusted operating efficiency ratio before they converge, or will they converge starting next quarter? Mark Graf : No, I think you, I think you're thinking about it right. I would go with your former characterization. There will be one more quarter where those costs are in there and, you know, the good news is I think we are comfortable that we're approaching the end of the case review portion of it is, which is the big dollar portion of the project itself. So, I would expect to see those yet. That's why I alluded to the fact while we're standing by our expense guidance for the year, we don't expect expenses to be linear across the remaining three quarters and 2Q may actually prove to be the high point quite honestly. Bill Carcache : Thank you very much. Mark Graf : Absolutely. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Howlett with UBS. Your line is open. Matthew Howlett : Thanks. Just on the funding side, can you just go into a little bit more detail what you did with the deposits, how far out you went? And then on the two ABS characterizations, was there any impact on the cost, with the winding that went on? What's the outlook do we all see get two hikes a share maybe you could comment on that in terms of funding. Mark Graf : I would say the vast majority of the growth in the deposit book has come in the savings product to a lesser degree, the money market and the CD books. So we're very focused on the indeterminate maturities. Those prove to have the lowest data overtime and also the stickiest customer retention characteristics, so that's why we're focusing in that particular area and why it has driven it. With respect to ABS transactions, I would say the answer is yes, there has been some impact obviously with respect to what's happened in the marketplace in terms of credit spreads. Overall, I would say our credit spreads are up roughly call it 30 basis points year-over-year, in addition to just the base rate changes, if you will, the index rate changes that have taken place over the course of the last year. That being said, it's still a very robust market. We were in market last week, did something on the order of $1 billion, give or take, and actually were able to walk pricing in. So, it still feels like a very accessible, very effective channel. Pricing, a little more expensive than it was, but clearly still very attractive funding. Matthew Howlett : Could you remind us again in going forward, if we do get a tightening cycle, what's the target in terms of deposits again versus securitization and is there one angle that you'd lean on more than others, more than another if we do get the start of a tightening cycle? Mark Graf : So, we haven't decided bias for deposits. There's a couple of reasons for that, the first of which is, as we've talked, we've worked really hard over the last several years to really have a cross sold deposit base, and we always like to use our balance sheet to support our customers. So, I think that's one reason. The other reason is because of the betas, right. I mean deposits do not reprice at the same rate as any of the capital markets fundings do, so we would have a decided bias to continue leaning into deposit growth, I would say. That being said, it takes time to grow deposits, especially relationship-oriented deposits. You can grow them really fast by hanging out the highest rate in town, but that's also got a beta of one. So, we're trying to do it the old fashioned way, where it adds real value. So, I'd look for us to continue leaning into deposits, but I'm not so sure 9% to 12% growth rate is the way to be thinking about it, but mid to high single-digit growth rates sure sound good. Matthew Howlett : Absolutely. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. I guess just on the rewards costs, I mean you had talked -- Mark, you had said that you intended to keep the bonus into the second quarter. What would make you change it in the second half? And does the 115 guidance include it for the full year? How should we think about rewards costs relative to that guidance and how it might relate to your plans to grow the business? Mark Graf : So, as I sit here right now, I still feel very good, Moshe, about the 115 basis points on the full year. I think our double program has been very effective. I think it's driving a big chunk of that revolve behavior that you're seeing out there and is something that we would be probably predisposed to continue. And I wouldn't change the guidance we've put out there in light of anything happening with respect to that. Moshe Orenbuch : Okay, good. And just a second question. I recognize and applaud the fact that you brought back 8% of the stock, but the constraint isn't actually the percentage of the stock that you bought back, it's the dollar amount, right. So that's basically saying that the share price fell and you were able to take advantage of that, which is wonderful. But the question is, are you able to push the dollar amount of buybacks a little harder? And I didn't notice any mention of going after the de minimus exemption that some of your peers have done and I'm wondering if you can talk about that. Mark Graf : Sure. A lot embedded in there. I'll try and tackle all the pieces. I would say first and foremost, again, I think we've been -- driven the highest yields to investors, between dividends and buybacks, of any of the financials out there. So, I think we've been very focused on it and every year, we've gotten more aggressive with that ask. So, from that perspective, I wouldn't dissuade you, Moshe, from -- again, thinking we would continue to, as we have comfort with the process and as the Fed has comfort with us, continue to be more aggressive there. In terms of the 1% de minimus ask, I think it has tended to be utilized by people primarily around, what I would call, unexpected events that weren't contemplated in capital plans, compensation dilution being one that comes to mind that I've seen a few folks do and a number of other things, as well. We would not be hesitant to use something like that if we had a like type event or similar event of some kind come along. But I would say it's clearly the 1%, in our minds anyway, is clearly not designed to be your CCAR approval plus 1% every year. That's really not why it's out there. Moshe Orenbuch : But I guess if you were to see that perhaps asset growth was at the lower end or lower end of expectations, couldn't that be a reason to think about it? Mark Graf : I think there could be a lot of reasons to think about it. The question is in what context do the people who allow you to do it, think about it? Moshe Orenbuch : Okay. Mark Graf : Right. So, I'm not so sure -- again, I think it's really designed to cover situations that weren't contemplated in a capital plan, as opposed to simply business trajectory issues. And again, I'd just point you back. We're in a CCAR submission cycle right now. We're going to be more aggressive. And we are driving by far and away the highest total yields of any of the financials with that 10% total yield last year. David Nelms : And I don't think the exception process is going to move the dial as much as what happens in CCAR itself. Mark Graf : If you think about it, 1% of our Tier 1 combo would be a little north of $100 million, so it's not exactly going to redefine our earnings stream. Moshe Orenbuch : Okay. Thanks. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Richard Shane : Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Look, we've seen the loan growth start to accelerate back into the target range. And I think that that's, to some extent, a function of optimizing the investments in growth. And you talked about shifting from marketing to rewards and I think laid out the potential that that will continue into the second half of the year. When I think about investment in growth, marketing is spending in advance, reward is spending concurrently. And then the last way you can invest in growth, and this sounds a little bit strange, but is on the credit side. And that's basically investing in growth down the road, paying for it down the road. Given your outlook in terms of benign credit, does it make sense at this point to sort of make some of that investment down the road and potentially open up the credit bucket a little bit? David Nelms : Well, I think that we would -- I would agree that those are all three good levers and we are pulling, where we think appropriate, all three. And in response to one of the earlier questions about what the various causes of us getting back increasing -- accelerating our loan growth, I did cite credit as one of the actions we've taken, in line increases, who we're approving, how we're authorizing. We are working to optimize all of the levers that you just cited. And the one I would probably add, because I think it's not just about money, the execution, things like new features that may not cost that much money, but maybe move behavior, is a fourth lever that I would add. And I think if you look at what we've produced in terms of innovation the last couple of years compared to others, like Freeze It and Free FICO and on and on, I think that innovation is one of the best ways to move the dial. Richard Shane : That makes sense. Look, I think one of the facets of your business is that you have very strong customer loyalty. And I'm not necessarily sure how you market that, but it certainly impacts the attrition within the portfolio in an environment where things are really competitive. David Nelms : Well, I think by not having a leaky bucket, we end up with two things. You don't have to put on as many new accounts to grow a certain rate if you're not losing out the back end, but it also helps us from a credit perspective, because with our average duration of 12 months -- excuse me, 12 years of customer relationship, compared to industry average around eight years, we don't have as many, as high of a percentage in those early years that have much higher credit risk. And that helps explain some of our better credit performance than most of the competitors in our industry. Richard Shane : Got it, hadn't thought of that. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open. Bob Napoli : Thank you. Just on some thoughts, David, on industry loan growth, if you could. I mean you've seen -- we've seen a ramp up in industry loan growth over the last year from 3% to around 6%. Do you think that is -- and we've seen that with a consumer that's still kind of sleepy. Is this essentially just the industry itself looking at the profitability of this product and tweaking the credit levers and the incentive levers to drive that growth, such that receding the -- we're setting the seeds for the next credit cycle, if you would? Some thoughts around that would be helpful. David Nelms : I would bifurcate the industry loan growth between lower credits versus higher credits, call it the subprime business versus the prime business. We really haven't seen -- I haven't seen much acceleration in the prime space. I mean it stopped shrinking. But my best guess is it's growing at 2% to 3% in prime credit scores today. If you see where the acceleration has come, it's come in the issuers who are in the subprime space, including private label, which obviously a lot of people get that are new to credit. So, there's a high correlation between the high yield competitors and the higher growth competitors at the moment. If you look at -- if you just isolate the prime competitors, some are still shrinking a little bit. And so I think it's been -- and so how that plays out is, we're not a subprime player, but how does the subprime credit play out and impact those competitors over time? I'm not an expert in that, but I'm comfortable that low growth in prime probably is hard to grow in that space, but is probably good from a credit performance perspective. Bob Napoli : Okay. Thank you. And just to follow-up on your deposit quality, you've seen a nice pickup in growth or steady growth in a direct-to-consumer Infinity products as a percentage of total funding, 44%, up from 42% a year ago. Where would you like that to be? Where can that go over the next five years, in an efficient manner, if you would? Do you have some targets for that? David Nelms : Well, we like the fact that it's our largest single funding source. And I'm very comfortable with where it's at. If it grows a little bit more, I think that would be even better. I was really pleased this quarter that we really didn't take our rates up, but yet we saw a very nice inflow of deposits. And so, that's helpful from a funding perspective, a customer relationship perspective. And I think over time, we'd like to add more checking accounts to the mix, we'd like to continue to grow the indeterminants in general, on savings and money markets, as Mark mentioned earlier. So, if it was a little higher over time, I think that would be even better. But it's -- we feel like it's at a good level right now. Bob Napoli : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities. Your line is open. David Scharf : Thank you. My questions are largely answered, but I did want to get a sense for you, back to the consumer spending patterns, this kind of even, rough mix of 50-50 from both new accounts as well as dormant accounts that's been driving the increase in revolving balances, could you give us a sense for how that mix measures up to both what your expectations were earlier in the year? I'm trying to get a sense for whether 50% of the growth coming from dormant accounts is potentially a bit of a positive surprise from what you would normally expect to see? David Nelms : Well, I'd say we've been -- our growth over the last several years has been roughly 50-50 base and new accounts. And so I think that's more of a continuation of a trend. I think if you think about sales; that probably comes a little bit higher from new accounts. And I would say, generally, loans have performed about at what we expected for the year and targeted. We had a lot of programs to go into place and we were happy they worked and they produced the result we expected. Sales, on the other hand, has continued to disappoint. And while I'm pleased that it was 4%, which matched the 4% loan growth, I would like to see the consumer become a little more -- given the strong balance sheet that they have and their capacity to spend, I'd love to see the consumer in general spend a little more, which would allow us to grow sales a little faster. David Scharf : Got it. And the I guess two percentage differential on card sales attributable to gas, just given the upward trajectory really since your Q4 call and prices at the pump, should we expect that to narrow considerably this quarter? David Nelms : I wouldn't say considerably, because remember, it's the year-over-year change. And so unless we got a dramatic increase in gas prices, it's going to probably be lower than the same quarter last year all year long. Now it may narrow each quarter, if it stabilizes. And it's certainly not as big of a downdraft as it was last year. But gas prices were over 10% of our sales 18 months ago. Now they're 5% or 6%. And so they're becoming less of an impact. But it's not going -- the 2% isn't going to go to zero next quarter because of the year-over-year nature. David Scharf : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is open. Mark DeVries : Yeah, thanks. Just wanted to comment -- or drill down on some of the comments again around the guidance and the NIM, in particular. Going into the year, you guided to relatively stable NIM and that's somewhat vague. But you're up 25 bps year-over-year and even slightly higher based on the average for 2015. And it sounds like, Mark, what you're saying is that's kind of biased flat. It could go a bit lower if you lean into some more of the promotional balance opportunities. But is it right to say that that guidance no longer holds, that we're looking at a higher NIM year-over-year than what we had in 2015? Mark Graf : Yeah if you think back to the fourth quarter call, I think what we said is there is a natural upward bias in NIM, but we were calling for -- call it, relative stability because we anticipated we might be doing some more promotional-related activities. The good news is we saw the reacceleration in growth we were looking for based on some of the things we did back in the middle of last year and it was coming in the form of good old fashioned utilization of the card, both in the hands of the existing card member base and the legacy card member base. So, I think we are definitely, Mark, saying we have not taken the right, for lack of a better term, to increase promotional activities off the table, which is why I'm saying I wouldn't put just a flat NIM in from here for the remainder of the year, but I think it's a very safe bet to say on a full-year basis, the NIM is not going to approximate the full-year basis of last year. I think that's a very safe bet at this point in time, based on the current trajectory of growth we're seeing. Mark DeVries : Okay. But given the success you've had with the loan growth so far without the promotional, is it right to assume that if we take our NIM down a little bit because you do more promotional, that's somewhat additive and that maybe we should expect loan growth to accelerate more from here? Mark Graf : We are not calling out that we're going to do any increased promotional activities, nor are we giving out guidance for what we expect the trajectory of loan growth to be from here. Just to be clear, all we're saying is at this point in time -- to this point, we have seen the growth trajectory reaccelerate into our target range and we feel good that we're getting it in a very constructive way that drives great returns through time. We haven't taken off the table the ability to invest more heavily in promotional activities, but we're not calling that we're going to do it either, just to be clear. Mark DeVries : Okay. I'm just trying to clarify some of the give and take between some of these promotional things I think you indicated, that that you feel good about the rewards rate so you still would look to be doing, I think presumably, a lot of the double cash promotion than if you were to lean into promotional. I'm just thinking of that as being potentially additive to your growth. Is that at least a fair way to think about it? David Nelms : Well, one way to think about it is we're at the bottom end of our range and we might want to take some actions to move it further into the range. Mark DeVries : Okay. Fair enough. Mark Graf : And just to clarify, Mark, you understand promotional comment could be on the balance side in terms of balance transfers or sales promotion, not just-- Mark DeVries : Yeah, absolutely. Yes. Mark Graf : Okay. Mark DeVries : Yes. Thank you. Mark Graf : Absolutely. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill Franklin for final remarks. Mark Graf : So, actually, this is Mark Graf. I'm going to jump in before I let Bill prepare his final remarks. To show that we are committed to timely and accurate disclosure, my Controller just passed me a note and said he's comfortable with me pointing you to a $40 million benefit on the tax line in the second quarter. So, to the extent there was any lack of clarity around my prior guidance, I would just say the number to think about for the second quarter tax benefit we discussed earlier is about $40 million, give or take. Bill, sorry to preempt you there. Bill Franklin : So, thank you everyone for joining us. If you have any other follow-up questions, feel free to call the Investor Relations department. Have a good night. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great evening.",

Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Discover Financial Services second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Bill Franklin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Bill Franklin - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin, as always, with slide two of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Q, which are on our website and on file with the SEC. In the second quarter 2016 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A period, it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter, we reported net income of $616 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.47, up 11% year-over-year. These results included a non-recurring tax benefit of $44 million, which contributed $0.11 to diluted earnings per share. Our Direct Banking business continues to deliver solid results. Discover achieved total loan growth of 4% over the prior year with a healthy net interest margin. In the card business, we also grew receivables by 4%. This receivables growth was the result of more new accounts and slightly higher customer spending and borrowing on their cards as our overall revolver mix for the portfolio increased. Card sales grew by 2% over the prior year, a bit lower than we would like. Our sales growth was outpaced by the growth in rewards; however, we're seeing benefits from the double rewards campaign in new accounts, sales from new accounts, and in the cost to acquire these accounts. Along those lines, we set a post-recession record for new card accounts during the quarter, demonstrating that our brand, rewards and overall value proposition continue to resonate with our target customers. We believe these new accounts will contribute to future sales and loan growth and will leverage our brand and increase consideration. We launched credit score card, which provides both current and prospective customers with access to their FICO score, as well as the summary of the data that is helping and hurting their score. Our other Direct Banking products also performed well. The organic student loan portfolio increased 15%, driven by our continued focus on increasing awareness of Discover Student Loans. Personal loans grew 10% over the prior year, driven by digital investments and increased marketing, which have allowed us to drive growth while still maintaining an average FICO on new accounts of around 750. Both student and personal loans are on track for record originations again in 2016. On the funding side of Direct Banking, I'm very pleased with the 16% growth in direct to consumer deposits. These deposits made up 47% of funding at quarter end. Our investments in marketing have continued to pay off, driving strong growth specifically in savings accounts and balances. Moving to our Payments business, PULSE volume declined 9% year-over-year. We expect PULSE volumes will stabilize around the end of the year. At the same time, Network Partners and Diners Club volume increased over the prior year, with Diners Club volume increasing 6%, driven by strong growth in the Asia Pacific region. During the quarter, we received a lot of positive recognition from third parties. To highlight, Fortune ranked us on its list of 100 Best Workplaces for Millennials. And Computerworld ranked us as one of the top 100 Places to Work for IT Professionals. We believe our commitment to treating our employees well translates into delivering the best products and services to our customers and superior returns to our shareholders. Overall, it was a good quarter. We're making progress against our key focus areas for the year and we're pleased with how we lined up versus other banks in the CCAR stress test results, as well as overall capital returns planned for the year ahead. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark and he'll walk through the details of our second quarter financial results. Mark? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by going through the revenue detail on slide five of our earnings presentation. Net interest income increased $115 million or 7% over the prior year, driven by continued loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total non-interest income decreased $74 million to $465 million. The prior year's results included $28 million in mortgage origination revenue, a category that's absent this year as we are no longer in that business. Net discount and interchange revenue was down 11%, driven by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 121 basis points, up 16 basis points over the prior year due to higher promotional and standard rewards, which David noted are helping attract new accounts. Sequentially, the rewards rate was up 15 basis points, driven by higher enrollment in spending in the quarter's rotating 5% category. Moving to Payment Services, revenue decreased $2 million from the prior year mainly due to the previously announced loss of volume from a third-party debit issuer. Overall, we grew total company net revenue by 2% for the quarter. Turning to slide six, total loan yield of 11.72% was 37 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 38-basis-point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in yield was primarily due to the higher percentage of revolving card receivables in the portfolio as well as the impact of last December's prime rate increase. On the funding side, we grew average direct-to-consumer deposits by $4 billion. Total funding costs increased only 8 basis points despite higher market rates, as their impact was muted by last year's fixed rate debt issuances and our growing direct-to-consumer deposit base. Overall, net interest margin expanded 31 basis points from the prior year to 9.94%. For the remainder of the year, we currently expect a relatively stable margin, but it will, of course, be impacted by any changes in our planned level of promotional activity, revolving behavior in the card portfolio and any future Fed actions. Turning to slide seven, operating expenses were down $21 million over the prior year. Last year's results had $62 million in expense associated with the operation and closure of the direct mortgage origination business, about a third of which was reflected in employee compensation. The $14 million year-over-year increase in total employee compensation you see in the table was driven primarily by higher head count to support compliance activities as well as annual merit increases. Marketing expenses were flat. The savings from the elimination of mortgage marketing activities were reinvested in other areas of the business. Professional fees fell $3 million. The work streams underlying the AML/BSA look-back project were, as expected, completed during the quarter at a cost of $12 million as compared to $19 million in the second quarter of last year. While the completion of these work streams represents a milestone, I would remind you that we are continuing to enhance our compliance program to meet the terms of our consent orders. Other expense was lower, as the prior year included $23 million in one-time charges associated with the exit of the home loan business. Turning to provision for loan losses in credit on slide eight, provision for loan losses was higher by $106 million compared to the prior year due to higher reserves in charge-offs primarily driven by loan growth. This quarter we increased reserves $28 million while last year we had a $41 reserve release. The credit card net charge-off rate of 2.39% increased by 11 basis points year-over-year and increased 5 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate of 1.63% increased 8 basis points year-over-year and was down 5 basis points sequentially. On balance, the credit backdrop remains benign and reserving continues to be driven primarily by the compounding effect of several years of consistent loan growth, a meaningful portion of which has come from new accounts. Looking at student loans, the net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, increased 8 basis points from the prior year due to continued seasoning of the organic book. Sequentially, the rate increased 25 basis points due primarily to seasonality. Student loan delinquencies, once again excluding acquired loans, increased 10 basis points to 1.88% as a larger portion of the portfolio continues to come into repayment and decreased 4 basis points sequentially. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations. Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was up 28 basis points from the prior year and down 7 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate was up 31 basis points from the prior year and up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were primarily driven by the seasoning of recent loan growth, which was consistent with our expectations. Next I'll touch on our capital position on slide nine. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was flat sequentially. This ratio declined 20 basis points from the prior year due to capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks and dividends. In the quarter, we again repurchased approximately 2% of our common stock. As David mentioned, we're pleased with how we lined up versus other banks in terms of our stressed capital ratios in the Federal Reserve's CCAR process. We received a non-objection from the Fed with respect to our proposed capital actions for the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. As a result, we plan to repurchase almost $2 billion of our common stock over the next 12 months. And last week our board increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.28 to $0.30 per share. At current share prices, this results in one of the highest total yields among CCAR participants. In summary, we delivered strong net interest income by growing loans in NIM, saw increased rewards expense primarily due to our double promotion, which drove more new and engaged accounts, grew the proportion of funding we get from deposits, and achieved a favorable outcome from the 2016 CCAR process. That concludes our formal remarks and now I'll turn the call back to the operator, Mike, to open the line up for Q&A. Operator : Our first question comes from Ken Bruce from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Good afternoon. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Ken. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Last quarter you discussed that you had not made a decision to accelerate growth or use some of the stronger margins to try to drive more growth. I'm wondering if you've had a change of heart around that particular issue, or if this is just a situation where you want to essentially just capitalize on these high margins and let the portfolio roll up on higher yields. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So I think the way I think about it, Ken, is really \u2013 and I'll let David comment as well, too, but I think about it as a constrained optimization, right? There's a combination of rewards \u2013 of returns in growth that you'd like to see. I think we're continuing to reserve the right to invest some of that margin strength we're seeing over the back half of the year. We currently haven't found any ways of doing it that from an NPV perspective really made sense for us. That's why we're continuing to guide to a relatively stable margin at this point in time, but giving ourselves the ability, I guess, to change that if we see a need to going forward. One of the things we did do is we did go ahead and reinvest the marketing spend from last year that we had in the direct mortgage business into some of the other businesses. You might see us lean into marketing expense a little bit as we go forward into the back half of the year relative to what you've seen from us lately. But we're pleased with the revolver sales growth we're seeing right now and pleased with the trajectory of NIM and loan growth. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And, Ken, the only thing I would add is we really haven't changed from last quarter. We're focused both on growth of loans as well as maintaining strong profitability. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. I had a question on whether or not you're getting similar levels of spend and lend volumes, and I know it's early days off of the record new account acquisition that you're doing off the back of this extended promo period. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : David, I think we're not quite to the point where we're getting expirations of the double cash back bonus, if that's what your question is. So I think that's something we'll be watching over the next several quarters. But I would say the spend during the time when they're in the promotions has somewhat exceeded our expectations, which is why we've continued to offer double. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And is the prime consumer generally, are you seeing a more willingness to revolve, or is it more the supply of credit generally expanding across the industry? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think at the margin, consumers appear to be, having deleveraged very significantly, are starting to very modestly increase their borrowings. And I think it's a very healthy amount. So you still see very benign credit, but you're seeing the credit card loan growth category across prime issuers move from shrinking to slight growth even in the prime space. David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Arren Cyganovich with D.A. Davidson. Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. You'd mentioned the recent strong account acquisition growth and you said the best since the credit crisis. I think last year you were also booking some pretty strong accounts. And we've seen some pickup in terms of loan growth. Are you expecting another acceleration from these recent account acquisitions or a bit more of the same trajectory? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I would say, we are certainly hoping that the strong new account growth along with other actions will help increase our loan growth a bit further into our range. As you know, we're looking for 4% to 6% in total. And so we're within that range. But we are hoping to go further into the range as the quarters go by in the future. Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thanks. And then, just quickly, on the rewards cost, came in a little higher than I expected. Did you push up your guidance for the year? I think you're at 115 basis points for the year. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I think in terms of rewards guidance, we've been speaking to something in that 115-basis-point area, as you discussed. I think what you saw in the quarter was really more an impact of what last quarter's rotating 5% cash back category was, that drove pretty significant engagement and that really drove the big sequential increase in rewards. On a full-year basis, we're still looking for something in that 115-basis-point range, maybe 1-basis-point or 2- basis-point higher, but nothing of any significant different from the guidance. Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You bet. Operator : The next question is from David Scharf from JMP Securities. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You may have touched upon this a lit with the mix. But can you provide a little more color on perhaps the 2% sales volume growth, which looks like it came in a little below expectations, and certainly, it's not coming from over the last three months from gas price trends. Any color on what you may be seeing there? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, as you know, our primary focus is on loan growth, which continues to be strong. It actually moved up just a slight amount to just over 4% from just under 4% last quarter. We don't aspire to have the same sales growth as peers who focus more on the transactor space. However, we would like it to be a bit higher than what we saw in the second quarter. And so we are hopeful that a number of the actions that we've been taking, whether it's more new accounts, focusing on engagement with our cash rewards program and other actions to help stimulate some sales volume will move the sales volume up a bit over the coming quarters as well. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Got it. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The only thing I'd... David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : And just \u2013 I'm sorry? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I was just going to say the only thing I would add to that is there's several folks with some very high headline rewards rates that are out there. And I think we've just said it doesn't seem to make economic sense to us in a lot of cases and those clearly are going to be the most appealing to the transactor who tends to drive the majority of the sales growth. So with a very lend-centric model in this environment, I would expect us to lag on the sales growth front. But, as David noted, we'd like to see it be somewhat higher than where it sits right now. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Got it. Helpful. And then, just as a follow-up, it looks like on the personal loan side, it looks like it's the first time in four quarters you're back up to double-digit year-over-year growth. Do you feel you're benefiting at all from some of the pullback by perhaps marketplace lenders, other refinancing products out there, or was there anything on the promotional side on your end that may have driven the performance? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We've produced record originations each year, the last few years, and we expect to do the same this year with actions we've taken. So I think most of the growth is our actions in marketing. And it's not really promotional in terms of promotional rates, but increased marketing and increased effectiveness of that marketing, yes. At the margins, I'm sure we're benefiting a bit from the pullback of some of formerly P2P kind of companies. But a lot of \u2013 as we've talked before, a lot of where they play is in the lower credits where we don't play. So I think to the extent that they also did pick up some prime \u2013 originate some prime loans and are originating fewer that should help us a little bit. And it certainly doesn't hurt (21:49). David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Betsy. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just a question on the reserving and the seasoning that you were talking about, since you are generating some incremental loan growth, some nice loan growth as we're trajecting here throughout this year, which we're expecting. Do you see that seasoning continuing to track up at the same peak that you've been experiencing over the last year-and-a-half or so? Or is there a point at which you feel that a sufficient portion of the portfolio is seasoned and reserve build will start to fade? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Betsy, I think at this point in time what you're really dealing with is the compounding effect of the loan growth as opposed to just the last quarter or two's loan growth that's really driving that reserving. The cards and personal loans both tend to take peak charge-offs about 24 months after you originate them. If you think about it, the vintage from two years ago is right at that peak; the vintage from last year is climbing the hill and the vintage from three years ago is still pretty high under the curve, but dropping off. So as we've continued to originate more new accounts every year successfully since the crisis. The area under that curve grows, because the vintage falling out of that peak is smaller than the one that's climbing the hill. So I think it's really the compounding effect of that that's the driver. I wouldn't expect \u2013 as long as we're able to continue driving loan growth at the levels we are right now and keep solid new account production across the products, I wouldn't expect to see us slip to a situation where we fall into a reserve release or a net neutral reserve position; at least not for any length of time. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The only two things I would add to that, Betsy, is one is, even if there wasn't season, it was absolutely stable credit, when you're growing loans, you'd obviously have to set aside some loan loss reserves to cover those new loans. And secondly, there's also obviously going to continue to be some volatility between quarters, given the large size of the reserve balance. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sure. And then, you know how the portfolio is trending from a credit perspective relative to what you were expecting when you underwrote them. Just on a vintage curve basis, has there been much change at all over the past several quarters or not really? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would say they've tracked generally to our expectations. If you're talking about a little bit longer term, they've tracked somewhat better because this credit environment has remained benign and there's been less normalization than we expected. And so where possible, we've tried to find places that we could do an incremental line increase or approve someone that maybe in this \u2013 going forward might actually be expected to have prime credit behavior. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from John Pancari from Evercore. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Good afternoon. Wanted to see if you can just give us your thoughts on the targeted efficiency ratio expectation, I guess, for full year 2016 and how that may roll into 2017. And then as part of that, just see how we should think about the elevated marketing expense for this quarter if we should expect that it would abate off of this level or perhaps grow from the $198 million? Thanks. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So I think we've guided to lower expenses in 2016 than we saw in 2015, but we haven't given any efficiency guidance other than to say we expect to keep trending back down toward that 38% level over the course of this year. I don't think we'll achieve it for the full year this year, and just to be clear on that front, given where the year started with some of these increased compliance and AML/BSA look-back costs. We're starting with such a low efficiency ratio relative to peers to begin with. Some of the one-time costs we saw just we're not going to cut muscle in order to cover those, because we want to keep the engine running and keep the customer experience what it's been. Still feel comfortable that operating expenses in 2016 will be lower than 2015. They may be a tad bit higher than the guidance we called out at the beginning of the year, but not materially so that would cause me to change guidance for you at this point in time. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And you mentioned a look-back costs, so you expect that to still go down from the $12 million that you saw this quarter? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We actually completed all the work streams related to the look-back itself this quarter. So that expense will no longer be with us going forward. But we will have other expenses related to enhancements to the compliance program to comply with the consent orders we have on that front. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Got it. Thanks, Mark. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yep. Operator : The next question is from Mark DeVries from Barclays. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. When you think about your levers for growing car loans, are you still getting enough traction from your cash back match and other rotating categories that we should expect you to rely more on that than on the 0% balance transfer offers? And if so, could you just talk about the implications of that for where NIM could end up in the range of your guidance of relatively flat? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'll start and then hand it to Mark. I'd say, generally, yes. The pivot that we made towards match and away from quite as aggressive on the balance transfer promotional offers really starting about a year ago has continued to perform well and is one of the reasons you're seeing elevated cashback bonus expenses with a healthy net interest margin and modest marketing spend as we get lower cost per accounts. So we continue at this point to be \u2013 feel good about that trade-off. The only thing I would add is that we are continuously looking at our rewards programs, our marketing mix, testing different things. And so I would expect at some point we'll test into other variations. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, and as far as NIM goes, Mark, the outlook would basically assume that a fairly consistent percentage of the growth we're seeing is coming from the balance transfer activities that we don't lean into it any more or any less candidly than we are right now that's in that stable margin guidance for the remainder of the year. As I alluded to earlier, I think we're probably more prone to invest some of that excess margin and a little bit of incremental marketing expense in the back half of the year as opposed to more BT activity. But we are reserving the ability to do it if we can find a way from an NPV standpoint to have it make sense. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You bet. Operator : The next question is from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Maybe I can ask somewhat of a follow-up question to David. David, just relating to rewards, it seems apparent that rates are going to stay lower for a longer period of time. And I guess, what do you think this means for the overall competitive dynamic both in the rewards space and the competition for incremental loan growth? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So you're asking me if we're going to continue to see an elevated competition in rewards. Is that...? Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: What do you think the fact that we're going to be in a further low rate environment does to the competitive dynamics in both rewards and loan growth? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Well, I would say, in a low rate environment, transactors aren't as costly as in a higher rate environment. And I think that's why you're seeing some other competitors chase the transactors very aggressively with rewards. And it's one of the reasons we're not chasing them quite so aggressively because if they're breakeven now and float goes up, do they start losing money again if rewards get that rich. I would say also that the low rate environment and the low return environment in banking is part of what I believe is causing greater competition in cards and specifically in rewards. And I think post-CARD Act, the issuers may be a little careful on how much they want to reduce their credit standards or how much they want to reduce their APRs, but they may feel like they can at least for now go with some high rewards rates and maybe in the future they have to adjust them down. So I think the low rate environment is driving some of that competition. And it's why we try to keep our discipline by having a sustainable rewards rate and be disciplined on maintaining profitability, not just go for really high growth but less profitable growth. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Ryan, I'd just add on to that, while it may result in sales growth being a little bit lower than we'd like to see it, in the near term, I think it's a real validation of the profit pool in the businesses and the lend-centric element of the business, which is where we intend to remain focused. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. If I could ask one other question for Mark. Just related to the guidance for a relatively stable net interest margin, when I think about a couple of different components, first on loan yields, you've talked about remixing the book towards less transact-oriented, do you think, one \u2013 do you think there's more to go there? Second, what is the impact of the fact that we may not see another interest rate rise this year? And then third, does low rates change the way at all you think about the duration of the funding base? Two years ago I think you guys termed out some of the funding. Does that change at all given the fact where rates are today? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : A bunch in there. I'll try and tackle it. I would say with respect to the latter question, I think we may let the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet drift a little lower naturally over the coming quarters just based on the revised outlook post-Brexit and the impacts on Europe and how that's trickling through the outlook for the global economy. So I wouldn't be surprised to see us do that. I think we will continue to maintain an asset-sensitive position. We think it's the right place for us. And I don't think you'll see us do anything transformational. Just, again, be evolutionary over time. With respect to the mix in the portfolio, I would say I think you might see a little bit more skewing toward revolvers and away from transactors as the year goes on, but I wouldn't say it would be so meaningful as to change your modeling for us radically from where we sit right now. And there was a third piece to your question, Ryan, that I've forgotten. I'm sorry. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just the impact of lower short-term rates. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Lower short rates, yeah, I would say the current rate curve \u2013 current rate environment doesn't concern me at all. I think we do well in the current environment. We do well on a flatter curve. And I think we're positioned really well. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You bet. Operator : The next question is from Don Fandetti from Citigroup. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes, Mark, given your capital position remaining very strong, I was just curious what your thoughts are on acquisitions. If you're seeing more deals that are of interest to you these days or if prices are still high in payments and other areas. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I would say with the AML/BSA consent orders we have from the Fed and the FDIC, I think we're kind of out of the acquisition space right now. Those really are red lights with respect to acquisitions. So we continue to look in the marketplace, stay plugged into the marketplace, make sure we're aware of flow. But I think our ability to act on anything that would touch or impact the bank charter right now is probably non-existent. I would say with respect to the payment side of the equation, I think I'll let David address that, because that doesn't specifically play into the bank charter. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I would say that I'm not seeing a lot more growth in M&A. I'm hearing more talk in the market, but I'm not seeing as much actually change hands. And the one thing I would say is that even while under the consent order, it could allow us to do certain portfolio kind of things. And I don't think that M&A is the first thing that we focus on as a team anyway. We look at organic growth. We have strong capital returns to shareholders. But, I guess, I would just moderate a little bit. I'm not sure we would 100% be totally out of that, even during this period. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think you could do those portfolio purchases. That's fair. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then a follow-up. David, obviously there have been a lot of mixed signals in terms of the consumer. I'm not sensing that you're seeing any type of deceleration. It sounds like it's more steady as she goes from your standpoint. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Don, was it consumer credit or more on just consumer sales or leveraging? Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. More on consumer sales and willingness to take on debt in confidence. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think that where the big action is in two places. I've certainly seen some growth from \u2013 in transactors and in some co-brand deals and there seems to be action there. There also seems to be a lot more loan growth in the subprime space. And certainly we're seeing competitors \u2013 I think it was more credit availability issue there, that after the crisis, everyone pulled back. And right now, you've got a couple of competitors who are really making a lot more credit available. And so we're seeing loan growth there. In the prime space that we focus on, I'm seeing generally slow sales growth, slow but now positive loan growth as an industry. And just gradual increases in confidence of the consumer since they're in a really healthy place from a personal balance sheet perspective. The healthiest we've seen in many, many years. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. I guess, my first question is just trying to reconcile some of the comments you've made about strong account growth. And the fact that we're not really seeing a pickup in sales growth nor the loan growth numbers, could you just reconcile that for us? Are these new accounts coming on and not really doing much? Or is this something else? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : What I would say is we're actually seeing strong sales growth of the new accounts, and probably, if I had to pinpoint where we're softest, it's in some of our orders transactors. And in some cases, some of them are getting picked up by offers they just can't turn down. And so that's why you're seeing our loans and profits do fine, but \u2013 and I guess, that's how I would reconcile it. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: I see. And as far as the new transactors that are coming on, they're just not revolving as much? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, I wouldn't say that. Both loans and sales and new accounts look good. And you're seeing with us a little bit continued pickup on loan growth. We're getting the results that are most important, which is loan growth. And so it's a secondary concern, but we still would love to also see a little more sales growth as well. And we're hoping to achieve that more over time. There's a couple of specific things going on. Obviously, gas prices continue to be about a 1% drag year-over-year. I think we'll have another quarter of that and then hopefully that should at least finally stabilize. You saw one of the warehouse clubs started accepting more cards and then that's going to pull some of our warehouse sales away as we have to kind of \u2013 as consumers have more choices than they did. And so we've got a couple of things like that, but overall, I think the big picture is few of our competitors are just incredibly aggressive at the moment with transactors. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Got it. And then, just a follow-up question to your commentary on the BSA/AML stuff. I guess, how long are you constrained at the bank as far as M&A is concerned after you're done? So should we expect this impact to be over the course of the next year or so? And then have there been any missed opportunities because of that? Or has it been net neutral? Thank you. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The good news is I'm not sure there have been missed opportunities. And if you look over the time before we got into any of this, we didn't have a huge M&A part of our business. We've been mainly inorganic growth story. But I think the key thing that we'd like to do at some point is we need to get the consent orders lifted. And two things have to happen. First, we need to finish the work. And then, it has to be burned in long enough and the regulators have to come in and actually lift the consent orders. And so we're focused right now on that first part. That's in our control. And there is no higher priority at a company than doing that. And as soon as we're to that place, we'll turn our attention to try to move along the process of getting the orders themselves lifted. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from James Friedman from Susquehanna. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi. Thanks. It's Jamie at Susquehanna. I just wanted to ask about the 2.39% NCO on cards. Mark, how should we be thinking about that trending for the remainder of the year? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I don't think we give charge-off guidance specifically, Jamie. What I would say is it's up, I think, 11 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And I think that really reflects that continued seasoning. I think there's two things going on. Number one, we're just coming off of an exceptionally low level for charge-offs across the consumer finance industry more broadly. So I do think there's what I'll call just a gradual normalization element of this that is taking place. But then you also have the seasoning of those multiple years of loan growth and the way that they mature and come to peak losses 24 months out that are driving that as well. What I'd say is, just as the backdrop, I would really underscore we see the credit environment as extremely benign right now. And I do think that the trends in the credit line are going to be more a function of growth in the portfolio and the seasoning of that growth and not really reflective of any deterioration that we see in the environment. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Got it. And my follow-up. So, Diners, not to be overlooked, had one of its better quarters in a while, 6% growth. Any commentary there? I don't remember if the comp was easy or is there something more structural in the execution that's improved? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think that we're \u2013 two things have happened. One is that there's been a fair number of transitions away from Citibank franchises into other hands and other people that maybe were a little more focused on growing in some of those markets. And I'd say that transition has now run its course. But the second thing is we've got \u2013 we've had some important new signings that we've talked about in recent years. The largest issuer in China is issuing the cards there. The largest issuer \u2013 credit card issuer in India is our Diners Club franchise there. And so players like that is what really helped drive some of the volume by putting on lots of new cards, growing sales, and certainly by far the growth is coming out of the Asia area more than anywhere else in the world right now. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : The next question is from John Hecht from Jefferies. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Afternoon, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, just back a little more details in some of the growth and the new customer acquisitions in the quarter. Number one, can you tell us what are the characteristics of the new customers? Any characteristics sort of by credit type or channel of customer acquisition? And then follow-on would be \u2013 I'll wait for the follow-on after I get the answer to that one. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'd say there's not a big change on \u2013 credit is pretty stable. The average FICO is slightly down over the last few years just as we've found that this new environment appears to be more here to stay. And so at the margin, we could lean a little more into FICO scores. But, generally, the quality of \u2013 the composition of the customers is very consistent with what we've pursued in the past. We're probably slightly heavier in students than we used to be because that's a really important source of ongoing new accounts and relationships. We've got some new products like our Secured Card that allows us to approve people that can't be approved without the security. And so we also have our Miles Card that appeals to a little higher spending customer, generally. But both of those portfolios are so small that at this point they're not really moving the needle. So overall consistent. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then, just with respect to the ramp of a new revolver customer, what's the utilization rate in the early months and when does the typical revolver customer reach peak utilization? And has that changed over the past year or two? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would say that as we shifted from being a bit more balanced transfer focused to more cash rewards focused, we're seeing actually a little faster sales growth and a little slower immediate loan growth out of the blocks. But what we are expecting is that the balance transfers expired in the past. And we usually saw some paydown at that point and we have a fewer of those to expire. So the loan build, we think will continue, and continue to build. And so we tend to get to pretty high \u2013 to a fairly typical maturity around year one at the 12-month mark. And generally, our loan average balances continue to grow from that point, but more modestly. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : The next question is from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. On the student loan business, any thoughts that you can give us, updated thoughts, on the opportunities that you have in that business? We're obviously going through a political season. Thoughts on risks to being able to grow that business? And how do you feel about that business today versus in the past and want to get that to contribute to your 4% to 6% growth? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I continue to feel good about it. One of the things that will be a bit helpful is that the organic business is becoming a higher and higher part of the mix. And so when we bought those two portfolios from Citi, they were large portfolios and they're continuing to pay down as you'd expect. But as they become a smaller and smaller part of the mix, the overall loan growth within the student loan business, I believe, can accelerate a little bit. I'd say overall there are certainly risks. As you say, it is a bit of a hot button politically. There tends to be confusion between the large federal student loan program, which is most of the lending and it's not underwritten and it has no publicized credit issues, versus the private loans, which are continuing to perform well. But sometimes people in the press will mix up those two things. And so I still believe that there's opportunity, that private student loans only make up about 6% of new student loan originations. And if the government ever pulls back at all, that could be an opportunity for accelerated growth. I don't think we're at that point right now. But some day that may happen, I believe. But there's also plenty of scrutiny around that business because it's very important. But as long as tuition continues to grow faster, I think there's a need for it. Our loans perform well. So I am still quite bullish on the business. Bob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And a follow-up question. Just another credit question, if you would. The credit cycle. Every time somebody in the industry announces slightly higher credit losses, the market gets really nervous. And if you look back over the last 30 years of credit cycles, we're going to have another credit cycle. You guys are clearly saying that you see benign credit. If we stay in this low growth economic environment without any economic shocks, I mean, under this type of a scenario, what do you feel \u2013 it sounds like the industry is loosening its credit box a little bit. Your FICOs are down a little bit. JPMorgan talked about expanding the credit box. Where do you think the credit cycle \u2013 is there a credit cycle? Or do you think credit losses will stay around the current range? Just any thoughts? What is normalized credit for Discover? Is it lower than it used to be? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, yes, there's still a credit cycle. It's a cyclical business. The new normal, I don't think we're going to know for quite some time. It's lower than it used to be. But we're going to have to actually go through a cycle or two to fully understand it. And that's why \u2013 and I would just say that our management team has been through a bunch of cycles, and it's one of the reasons that we still are keeping very disciplined. We'll make some changes at the margin, but I think you're not hearing us say that there's some big opportunity we're going to loosen up because we think credit cycles are over. So I generally \u2013 people that grow really fast in loans for a short period of time, it comes back and bites them. And that's one reason we have a top-end to our loan growth projections. We don't think growing more than about 6% at the high-end can be done today without taking too much credit risk. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I would just follow on to that just to make sure we're calibrating correctly. When David talks about a modest expansion of the credit box, I'd really utilize that modest word. I think historically what we've told folks is the line-weighted FICO in the card business is around 732, something like that for the portfolio. If you drew a bull's-eye that would say 7 basis points or 8 basis points around that number, that's where your line-weighted originations this year would be. So you're not talking about a significant expansion of the credit box by any stretch of the imagination. Operator : The next question is from Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Historically, Mark, I think you've indicated that about half your card growth comes from new accounts and half from existing accounts. And I'm wondering if that dynamic has changed at all given the nature of the accounts that you're currently originating. R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would say we're seeing a little bit more of it. It's skewing a little bit more to the new account side of the equation right now. I don't think it's all the way to 60/40, but it's trending in that general direction, really favoring the new accounts, driving the loan growth. And I think that's largely for the reason that David noted a moment ago, those new accounts aren't coming on with as much BT as historically they did. So they have more open to buy, and with the engaged behavior we're seeing out of those accounts as they're coming on the books, they are comprising a greater portion of the sales growth right now. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : And as it relates to the rewards costs, I think you indicated that some portion of it does relate to maintenance of your current book. Do you consider that to be a cyclical phenomenon or more of a secular one? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : What exactly do you mean by maintenance, Eric? Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : I think earlier in the commentary, David mentioned that the higher rewards cost in the period had to do both with acquisition as well as with traditional rewards, and I'm wondering if that increase in the traditional rewards is a cyclical or secular dynamic. In other words, is it just a function of the current competitive environment or is it the new cost of doing business over the long term? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I see. Well, I do think in part it's a new cost of doing business. But it's because it works. I think you can go to an unsustainably high level, which we're not prepared to do. But it has just fantastic appeal to prime card customers. And so people have been copying what we've been doing for a \u2013 since we started. And in some cases they may be taking it to an extreme. If you look at what's driving our rewards cost, there's a certain sort of more permanent shift as we move from what used to be up to 1% to flat 1%. And then, there are quarterly changes based on the 5% program, the double match on new accounts. And those can go up or down over time. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks for the explanation. Operator : The next question is from Jason Harbes from Wells Fargo. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So you paid out essentially all of your earnings during your last CCAR cycle, and yet the capital ratio remained essentially stable at about 14%. And I think you've said in the past that longer term you think 11% would be the right level to run the business. So I'm just curious what sort of timetable you think you might be able to get there? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I would say it's hard to say, Jason, is the honest answer to the question. I think we're comfortable with loan growth in the range we're seeing it right now. We'd like to see it be a little higher into the range, obviously, as David noted, but I think loan growth is consuming a chunk of that. I feel really good about going through the CCAR process and producing one of the highest yields among all the participants, buying back close to 8% of shares on an annualized basis, if you look at last quarter. I'm hard-pressed to see how to craft a path for you for how long it's going to take to get there. I think the one thing we've said over and over again and we'll commit to it is we're not going to do anything crazy with it just because we have it. We recognize it's our investors' capital and not ours and we will treat it appropriately. We continue to look for ways to return more of it. Every year we've gotten more aggressive in that CCAR ask. Over the year prior, I think a reasonable person could assume that that process wouldn't deviate in our current thoughts as we look forward either. But exactly how long it's going to take to get there, I just don't know how to answer that question. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Fair enough. And just as an administrative follow-up, it looks like the tax rate, if we strip out the benefits, has been running around 36% to 37% so far this year. Is that a reasonable run rate going forward? R. Mark Graf - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think that's a reasonable number to utilize going forward. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our last question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks. And I would add my congratulations on the CCAR performance. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): You're very welcome. Question has been batted around in a bunch of ways and you did mention that some of the volume decline or decline in the growth rate was a result of older customers taking their volume to more aggressive offers. Is that something that you see as accelerating or decelerating? Are you going to take steps to deal with that? How should we think about that over the course of the next few quarters? David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think that we are taking some steps, but frankly, we're not willing to match unprofitable offers. And so my best guess is that it would be relatively stable. And some of the actions we're taking would probably prevent it from accelerating more. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thank you very much. David W. Nelms - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Franklin for final remarks. Bill Franklin - Vice President- Investor Relations : We'd like to thank everyone for joining us. If you have any other follow-up questions, feel free to call the Investor Relations department. Have a good night. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great evening.",

Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch John Hecht - Jefferies LLC Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Brian D. Hogan - William Blair & Co. LLC Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Discover Financial Services Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Bill Franklin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Bill Franklin - Discover Financial Services : Thank you, Chantal. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin with slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC today in an 8-K Report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs, which are on our website and on file with the SEC. In the third quarter 2016 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A period, it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated. So, now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter, we reported net income of $639 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.56, including $0.07 of one-time tax benefits. Overall, we delivered another strong quarter, with EPS up 13% year-over-year and a return on equity of 23%. Our Direct Banking business continues to perform well, accelerating the pace of total loan growth to 5% over the prior year. In the card business, we grew receivables by 4%, once again much faster than card sales which grew by 1% over the prior year. As I mentioned last quarter, we remain more disciplined than certain competitors in rewards spend, and as a result we have sacrificed some transactor sales volume. We are, however, taking some actions on rewards to accelerate card sales. But we are not chasing unprofitable volume. I remind you that loan growth, which drives most of our profits, is driven by revolver spend. Our product continues to resonate well with prime revolvers, and that has allowed us to achieve loan growth in our target range. We are focused on delivering the best products to our customers, and we are continuously innovating, testing and implementing new features and benefits, ways to serve our customers better or more efficiently, and we offer rewards that provide real value to our card members. Our cards continue to be well regarded in the marketplace as evidenced by MONEY Magazine naming three of our cards, Discover it, Discover it Miles, and Discover it Secured to their annual Best Credit Cards list last month. I'll now move to our other Direct Banking products, which also delivered strong performance in the quarter. The organic student loan portfolio increased 14%, with strong performance during this year's peak back-to-school period. Personal loans grew 16% over the prior year, driven by product enhancements and opportunistic marketing which took advantage of pullbacks in advertising by some marketplace lenders. Both student and personal loans are on track for record originations again in 2016. On the funding side of our Direct Banking products, we increased direct-to-consumer deposits 19% over the prior year. This was driven by some of the highest retention rates we've achieved, and we accelerated growth in new customer balances. Though market rates have increased in the last year, our funding cost for direct-to-consumer deposits has remained relatively flat. Moving to our payments business, PULSE volumes declined 6% year-over-year, but were flat quarter-over-quarter, showing some volume stabilization. At the same time, Network Partners and Diners Club volume increased over the prior year, with Diners Club volume increasing 12%, driven by continued strong growth in the Asia Pacific region. Finally, I'd like to talk about something we're very proud of here at Discover. In August, J.D. Power announced that Discover ranked highest in credit card customer satisfaction for the third straight year. I'd like to thank each of our 15,000 employees who continue to work hard to deliver the best possible value and experience to our card members. Overall, it was a good quarter. We achieved record EPS, even excluding the one-time tax benefits. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark and he'll walk through the details of our third quarter financial results. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start by going through the revenue detail on slide 5 of the presentation. Net interest income increased $140 million or 8% over the prior year, driven by a combination of loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total non-interest income decreased $27 million to $476 million. Net discount and interchange revenue was down 9%, driven by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. Our rewards rate was consistent with the second quarter, and up about 13 basis points from the prior year. The increase over last year is primarily driven by higher promotional rewards, principally our Cashback Match program, which helped to drive strong new account growth this quarter. We expect to continue with focused innovations around our rewards program to drive engagement in our target segments, and as a result, we expect the rewards rate to come in around 119 basis points for the full-year 2016. Moving to Payment Services, revenue was flat year-over-year as lower volumes at PULSE were offset primarily by lower incentives. Overall, we grew total company net revenue by 5% for the quarter. Turning to slide 6, total loan yield of 11.82% was 45 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 50 basis point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in yield was primarily due to a higher percentage of revolving card receivables in the portfolio, as well as the impact of last December's prime rate increase. On the funding side, we grew average direct-to-consumer deposits by $5 billion, to make up 46% of our total funding. Our funding cost increased 10 basis points, driven by higher market rates, higher FDIC assessments due to large bank surcharge, and changes in funding mix as we extended the maturity profile of our brokered deposits. Overall, net interest margin expanded 37 basis points from the prior year to 9.99%. For the fourth quarter, we currently expect net interest margin to be relatively flat. We may, however, utilize some of the healthy NIM toward promotional balance growth initiatives. Turning to slide 7, operating expenses were up $13 million over the prior year. I would remind you that last year's results had $23 million in expense associated with the wind-down of the direct mortgage origination business. The largest driver behind the $5 million year-over-year increase in employee compensation you see in the table was higher head count to support compliance activities. Marketing expenses were up $27 million, as we made opportunistic investments primarily in card, but also in student and personal loans. Professional fees fell $17 million, primarily due to the completion of look back related anti-money laundering remediation activities in the second quarter of 2016. Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on slide 8, provision for loan losses was higher by $113 million compared to the prior year, due to higher reserves and charge-offs, primarily driven by loan growth. This quarter we increased reserves $75 million, while last year we had a much smaller build of only $8 million. The credit card net charge-off rate of 2.17% increased by 13 basis points year-over-year, and fell 22 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate of 1.87% increased 22 basis points year-over-year and was up 24 basis points sequentially. On balance, the credit backdrop continues to remain benign. Reserving was primarily driven by the compounding effects of several years of consistent loan growth. Looking at private student loans, the net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, increased 8 basis points from the prior year due to seasoning of the organic book. Sequentially, the rate decreased 8 basis points due primarily to seasonality. Student loan delinquencies, once again, excluding acquired loans, were relatively flat. Overall, the student loan portfolio continues to season generally in line with our expectations. Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was up 64 basis points from the prior year and 25 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate was up 18 basis points from the prior year and down 4 basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were primarily driven by the seasoning of recent loan growth, and are consistent with our expectations. Next, I'll touch on our capital position on slide 9. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio declined sequentially. The ratio decreased 40 basis points in the prior year, due to capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks and dividends. In the quarter, we repurchased 2.5% of our common stock, including the incremental $100 million we announced in August following the Federal Reserve's non-objection to our de minimis request. In summary, we delivered strong net interest income by growing loans and NIM, saw increased rewards expense, primarily due to our Match promotion, which drove more new and engaged accounts, and while provisions were a headwind, the consumer credit backdrop remains relatively stable. That concludes our formal remarks. Now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Chantal to open the line for Q&A. Operator : Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Just had a question on the personal loan growth. I appreciate the color on the acceleration in the growth. Should we expect that growth rate to sustain itself over the course of the next 6 months to 12 months? And then maybe you could just speak to some of the credit quality degradation and how comfortable you are with originating in that growth. Thanks. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Sure. We feel really good about the accelerated growth we've achieved in that business and we believe that we'll be able to continue to maintain roughly that level of personal loans growth, and that's helped us to bring us now right into the middle of our quarter for 6% overall loan growth target. And we feel good about the credit quality. The FICO scores are relatively flat for new customers and some of the initiatives we put in place, like the higher loan limits of $35,000 versus the $25,000 we had before, are helping us to sustain higher average balances and approve some loans that we were not able to approve in past years. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Sanjay, it's Mark. I would kind of tack on to that, just to really support the credit quality point. I know that 64 basis point increase is a little eye-popping maybe, but it is very strong loan growth. The reserve build really reflects the seasoning of loan growth. I'll give you a little preview, when you see our Q here in a couple of weeks, 96% of our personal loans continue to have a FICO north of 660. So the credit quality on that book continues to be extremely strong. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from David Scharf with JMP Securities. Your line is open. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Well, good afternoon. Maybe I'll stay focused on the credit side. Just curious, you commented for the different asset classes that credit was coming in generally in line with expectation. Should we view the magnitude of the ending allowance rate is a little bit of catch-up for conservatism, given how strong some of our other areas of the business were? Just trying to get a feel for how much of the increase in losses in provisioning is, we should view as credit normalization versus seasoning. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, I wouldn't say there's any fluff in there, for lack of a better term. I think it's a very model-driven process on the front-end to which we apply some judgment on the back-end, but that judgment is pretty rigid. In terms of how to think of that and parse it up, what I would say is, the biggest thing that's really driving some of the increase over the course of the last couple of quarters is the fact that, over the last several years, you had the back book of legacy loans which is three years or more seasoned, it's over 80% of the book, we were getting really big improvements in that legacy back book. And it was masking the impact of the growth-driven provisioning that you're seeing from those new accounts that's are three years or less on book. And as the legacy portfolio has really stabilized and isn't seeing further improvements in credit losses, that's what's really driving the impacts of provisioning. You no longer have that muting effect. So, I would echo our earlier comments, I would say the credit environment continues to feel very benign. We feel good about the environment and the originations we're doing in the environment today. And I would expect provisions into the foreseeable future really to continue to be driven more by the seasoning of loan growth and not by any sense a deterioration in the books. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Okay, very helpful. Thanks. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is open. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Mark, and looking back at your long-term guidance from, I think it was your fourth quarter 2015 earnings call, I believe you guys were looking for a normalized NCO rate of about 3% to 4%. And kind of thinking about your comments on continued credit normalization and credit remaining benign and seasoning effects and kind of like everything kind of still being okay, are we kind of to expect that the continued normalization of credit would likely lead your reserve rate to continue to grind its way higher towards that 3% to 4% normalized level? I think it ended the quarter at 2.75%, up 26 basis points year-over year. Does that trajectory continue to trend towards that 3% to 4%? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, I would say we would expect a continued very slow normalization in credit. I don't see any significant jumps of any kind. Clearly, I think we would all acknowledge we're operating below the long-term averages for card loss rates, for loss rates really across all of our products, quite honestly. So, we would expect some normalization over time. That being said, I'd go back to those earlier comments, Bill, and just underscore again the environment just feels very benign out there right now. We're not seeing real significant signs of deterioration. So I think it's really more a slow grind than a steep hill, at this juncture anyway. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay, that's great. And as a follow-up, if I may, one of the things that you've expressed a little bit of concern over in the past is kind of like, I guess, the tripwire effect, if you will, from the CCAR process, particularly relating to the risk of qualitative failure, and with the Fed's decision to eliminate that now and some of the other changes that have been proposed for financials that aren't considered G-SIBs, I was hoping that you could comment on that and share broadly how we should be thinking about or how you're thinking about that from Discover's perspective. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Sure. I mean, I think looking at Governor Tarullo's most recent comments, reading the NPR, I think we are what I would say, I'd describe us as cautiously optimistic. I think it's still too early to really know what is actually going to fall out of the NPR precisely, and the stress capital buffer that the governor spoke of, I don't think that's even referenced in the NPR itself. I think that was just really even in the speech. So I think there's a lot still to come out in the details, shall we say, as we get it. But we took it as a positive signal. We have been very focused on increasing our payouts over time and we clearly see nothing in the guidance that we've had thus far that would cause us to think we couldn't continue to look to increase those payouts. And hopefully, as we see more details behind this, it will give us even a little bit more runway than we would otherwise hope to have had. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I think I'll ask a question away from credit for the moment. Looking at PULSE, it's been a kind of a tough sector for quite a while for some obvious reasons. I guess, some have kind of suggested that there may be some needs for consolidation in PIN debit. I guess my question is how do you look at that as a strategic asset? Are there alternatives for it? Do you see it potentially being involved in industry consolidation? Thank you. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Sure, Ken. I think that it has indeed been difficult not only for PULSE but the other PIN networks, given in particular some of the actions that Visa took following the Durbin Amendment. And I guess the good news is, as I indicated in my points upfront, a lot of our volume lost in the last year or so was from one big customer, and we saw some stabilization of our PULSE volumes this quarter sequentially. And so I think \u2013 I feel like we're hopefully through the worst of some of that challenge. But the constraints continue to be really difficult in terms of rules and how the migration to EMV cards is, what the rules are on the various issuers that the dominant players have. I think that consolidation is certainly possible, and at some point would it \u2013 I mean, we and First Data have by far and away the largest of the independent PIN networks, so one could argue that one or both of us might end up being in a good position to be the consolidators. And I think we have some things to offer because we do have signature debit, not just PIN debit, which is unique among all the independent PIN networks. But with that being said, if at any point we decided we were not the best owner, we are focused on shareholders and doing the right thing to build shareholder value. So we'll continue to pursue lots of different options in the industry. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is open. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Thanks very much, guys. Mark, you mentioned that your NIM benefited a little over the quarter because of higher amount of revolving receivables. Would this imply that, I guess, maybe are utilization rates on the up in terms of customer behavior, and if so, do you guys have a perspective on what's driving that? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So I would say utilization rates are \u2013 they're relatively flat. I think the big driver in revolve mix, quite honestly, is we're continuing to grow our target segment, which is prime revolver customers. And as David noted earlier, we continue to see some degree of transactor attrition in the book with some of the very lucrative, I'll call them, rewards rates that are being put out there by some of our competitors. So, in terms of consumer leverage, we don't see significant leveraging on the part of the consumer, and that's part of what feeds the overall thought process about it being \u2013 continuing to remain a benign credit environment at this point in our minds. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And second, just in terms of near-term thoughts for the allowance levels, I know I look at the last couple years, there was a modest increase in allowance in the fourth quarter but it looked like maybe because of seasonality, a little lower than allowance billed (21:07) in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. Any thoughts on that and how we should think about that for the near term? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, I mean, we don't give forward guidance, but the one thing I would say is you are correct that there is a seasonal impact to the reserves that does come about in the fourth quarter. We reserve for what's on the balance sheet and card loans tend to balloon, for lack of a better term, in the fourth quarter and then pay down again as we go on into the first quarter. So that can have an impact. Now, that can also be muted and mitigated by trends we see in the portfolio itself, right? But just the absolute book on which you're reserving will grow. So if everything else stays constant, theoretically your provision would grow along with that as well. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : [Operator Instruction] Our next question comes from Jason Harbes with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I have a question on fees. We saw a nice rebound in loan fee income this quarter. Could you maybe comment on the drivers of that and perhaps the sustainability as we look forward within the context of the competitive threat from some new entrants that are waiving fees, particularly in the personal lending side of your business? Bill Franklin - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. Hey, Jason, it's Bill. Most of our loan fee income is driven by late fees, and they typically have a seasonal increase in the third quarter. So that's not anything in terms of new annual fee products or anything like that, but more just the trends, seasonality and late fees. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for the clarification. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Hogan with William Blair. Your line is open. Brian D. Hogan - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. The question is regarding the rewards cost. I think you increased \u2013 at a competitor conference in September, you kind of alluded to a 1 basis point to 2 basis point increase over your kind of the 1.15%, and now you're saying 1.19%. I assume it's just relative to the competition out there and how it's intensified, but just kind of comment on that. And then as a follow-up, can you comment on spending on rewards versus marketing and how you're thinking about the two? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Sure, Brian. The biggest factor behind our higher rewards rate is our double promotion for new accounts. And we're pleased with the economics and the lower cost per account and the greater number of new accounts that's driving. And so we've continued to aggressively offer that. And it's driving that rewards rate a little bit faster than we had even anticipated a few quarters ago. And your second part of your question was around how we think about it as marketing, and we really think about promotional rates in conjunction with what it does to cost per account. And that's true with promotional APRs as well. And we are constantly testing and evaluating what gives us the lowest all-in cost and the best long-term profitability from the combination of marketing spin, promotional rewards, and promotional APRs. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : And I'd just underscore, the overall objective of that program is to drive engagement in the target marketplace, right? So I think it's really important to point out we don't have any desire to be a me-too in the very high-end rewards space. Brian D. Hogan - William Blair & Co. LLC: And just a follow-up to that. Could you comment on the competitive environment from rewards? I mean, I know it's incredibly intensive, but have you seen any increased incremental? I mean, obviously, the Sapphire card is out there and stuff like that, but... David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, I would say there are certain offers out there that we scratch our heads about how they could possibly make anyone's potential hurdle rates, and I think one of the indicators is that you go online and look at the gaming sites and there are certain card offers right now that before saying go get this card, they've gone viral, and I'm not sure it's necessarily even the target market that may be responding to some of these offers. And you know, we've seen some of this in the past and we're somewhat late cycle. People are seeing credit cards as a much more profitable product than most anything else in banking. So they're diverting resources. But frankly, some of these offers I think will, in the long run, have to be significantly devalued, because how they're used and what the attrition rate is and how many people leave after the promotional time period will all drive the economics. And I would suspect that some are not sustainable. Brian D. Hogan - William Blair & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Your line is open. Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask about the margin a little bit. Can you discuss, to the extent that you're seeing a benefit from transactors potentially being poached away by some of the increased competition, is that accelerating or is it stable? Is it a steady tailwind to your NIM that should continue in the next year? How should we think about that? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So, it definitely does have an impact on the NIM. It's not the largest of the component pieces that's impacting NIM. I would say in terms of transactor attrition, it's a modest amount of it. It has been relatively consistent in terms of that contribution. Don't really want to forecast, looking forward, what's going to happen with transactor volume and transactor accounts, because candidly, we don't want to attrite those transactors forever. So, I think there'll be some element of that. But really the big drivers on the NIM expansion continues to be the card yield itself, as well as that higher revolve rate, which is a component piece that you noted is that \u2013 that really is affected by that transactor mix. But I would also say, it's been very effective management on the part of the treasury team and the deposits business on our funding costs, which has been really a huge contributor to that 37 basis point year-over-year increase in NIM that you see reported. Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Excellent. Thank you. And if I could ask a quick follow-up. There's been some discussion, and I apologize if you actually addressed this earlier, I joined the call late. But there's been some discussion of the 2015 vintage in the credit card space not being nearly as strong as its prior vintages for whatever reasons. Are you seeing that in your portfolio as well? And is it just sort of the natural as we get further and further away from the recession or is it increasing risk appetite, any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : I would say if you think about it, we just contributed some new accounts to our securitization trust here a couple of months back. So you now have vintage data for some of those newer originations that are there. And I would say the 2015 year for us thus far looks pretty solid. The one thing I would caution you on in looking at those vintage curves though that I pointed out there is in adding new accounts to the trust, you don't add any charged-off accounts. So the numbers you're going to see there for those new accounts are going to be somewhat elevated, because until we actually start taking charge-offs on those or getting recoveries on those rather, you're really looking at gross charge-off numbers. Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Mark. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : The recoveries that weren't added, right? Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Harbes with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Jason, did you have a follow-up question? Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Sorry, I was on mute. Thanks for taking my follow-up. So, I had another question, one of your peers recently commented about some potential impact that they're seeing from recent regulatory guidelines around debt collection. Is that something that you've seen any impact from or would you expect to? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So, we have not seen any impact from that yet. I think the folks who've really commented on it have traditionally sold a chunk of their portfolios. We have not in the last 10 years sold any of our portfolios. So I'd say we continue to evaluate the proposal. It's really kind of too early for us to fully understand its implications, but it's not factored into our reserve estimates, nor do we currently think it's a big issue for us. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : You bet. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Franklin for final remarks. Bill Franklin - Discover Financial Services : Thank you, Chantal. The investor relations team will be around this evening if anyone has any follow-up questions, and I hope everyone has a good night. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great evening.",

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Discover Financial Services Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer session, [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Bill Franklin, Head of Investor Relations you may begin your conference. Bill Franklin : Thank you, Chantal. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate all of you for joining us. Let me begin as always with Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which is in the Investor Relations section of discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8-K Report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs, which are on our Web site and on file with the SEC. In the annual and fourth quarter 2016 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A period, it would be very helpful if you limit yourself to one question so we can make sure that everyone is accommodated. So, now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to David. Who will begin his comments on Page 3 of the presentation. David Nelms : Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to review the full year 2016 accomplishments and 2017 key focus areas and then turn it over to Mark to cover fourth quarter results. 2016 was another strong year, as we delivered 21% return on equity and we accelerated loan growth. This loan growth acceleration as well as net interest margin expansion drove strong revenue growth.  Operating expenses benefited from the completion of the AML look back project, earlier this year and the exit of the home loan business last year. Higher provisions from the seasoning of the last several years of loan growth, partially offset some of this positive operating leverage, but were in line with our expectations for credit costs. All-in our full year earnings per share rose 12% bolstered by almost $2 billion of share repurchases. We accomplished a great deal in 2016 against our key focused areas, including as you can see on Slide 4, accelerating the pace of loan growth to nearly 7%. Above the 4% to 6% expectation we set a year ago. In total, we increased loans by nearly $5 billion, our largest organic increase in loan balances in 15 years. Our card business was the largest driver of that growth. Reflecting on some cards specific accomplishments, we launched credit score card, which provide both current and prospective customers free easy access to their FICO score. And we introduced the Discover it Secured Credit Card, targeted customers who are looking to establish or rebuild their credit history. Our credit cards continue to resonate well with prime revolvers, as we have [ph] a post-recession high number of new accounts for the year, which was the biggest driver of the loan growth. We achieved this growth while maintaining our disciplined approach to underwriting and as the result the credit quality remains strong. Our total company net charge-off rate excluding acquired loans was 2.24% in 2016, 12 basis points above 2015, still very low relative to historical experience and among the lowest in the industry. Moving to our other direct banking products on Page 5, personal loans set a record with originations of $4 billion, an increase of 31% over the prior year. Growth in originations was largely fueled by product enhancements and strong execution. Product enhancements in 2016 included a higher maximum loan amount and improved mobile responsive Web site and application and security [ph] functionality. Which allows customers to review [ph] their interest rate and estimate monthly payments without impacting their credit score. Student loans also set a record with 1.4 billion in originations, an increase of 9%. We expanded our student loan awareness efforts via marketing and our field sales force, as well as redesign of the application experience, resulting and a higher conversion rate and more satisfied customers. In payments, the discover network continues to provide significant benefits to our card issuing business and network partners. I am pleased that all PULSE Network Volume is stabilizing as shown on Page 6, after trending down for the last couple of years, due primarily to the competitive response related to the implementation of the Durbin Amendment in 2012. I believe PULSE is now poised for modest growth in 2017. Internationally, we established a new partner shift with Elo, the largest resilient card network to allow Elo card holders to use their cards across our global network. Diners Club returned to growth are in FX adjusted or real basis a couple of years ago, but I\u2019m happy to see volumes grew as well on a nominal basis in 2016. As several of the new partners we\u2019ve signed over the last few years are now growing nicely. Moving to Page 7, we\u2019ve returned more than 2.3 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases last year, which represents 99% of our net income. As a result, we reduce out saving shares of common stock by 8%. This combined with net income growth of 4% drove our EPS to be 12% higher. You can also see in the chart on the right how our return on equity has remained above 20% for the last four years, much higher than other large banks. As we look back on 2016, we feel good about all we\u2019ve been able to accomplish. Now I\u2019ll spend a couple of minutes discussing our key focus areas for 2017 before I turn it over to Mark to walk through the fourth quarter results. First, we will be focused on sustaining profitable growth. In card we will continue to enhance our products by introducing innovative features and benefits and prudently adjusting reward offerings to drive greater customer engagement. Underlying all of our initiatives is our commitment to disciplined credit management and great customer service, which has historically served us well. I think it\u2019s fair to say that a number of competitors are pursuing growth for the sake of growth, which is generating some transactor sales share shift, but resulting in lower revenues for them. By contrast, you saw our loans and revenue grow at similar rates in the fourth quarter. Our approach and execution have shown discipline and that is our continued commitment to shareholders. Building on our momentum in both lending and deposit products, we bore [ph] increased marketing to improve consumer awareness and consideration across products, as well as continue our efforts to increased product differentiation. To do this, we will also invest in technology to enhance our products and processes. So that we can offer consumers what they want most and make it simple for existing customers to add additional products. In payments, we have a unique set of assets, which we believe presents many long-term opportunities. Near term we are focused on getting the most from our proprietary network for our card issuing business, including increased acceptance and brand differentiation. Third party volumes stabilized at the end of the year and we continue to seek opportunities to defend and grow our PIN debit business and penetrate the signature debit market. Additionally, we will continue to pursue new ways to partner, to better leverage our network and drive volume growth. In 2017, we will remain focused on enhancing our AML/BSA compliance functions. Continuing to invest in compliance and risk management strengthens our operations and supports our leadership position in customer service. In closing, I want to thank our employees for serving our customers so well and producing strong financial results in 2016. I\u2019m excited about the momentum we have going into 2017. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark to cover fourth quarter results and provide some guidance for the year. Mark Graf : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll begin my remarks on Slide 8 of our presentation. For the fourth quarter we reported net income of $563 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.40. Overall, we delivered another strong quarter with EPS up 23% year-over-year and return on equity of 20%. Turning to Slide 9, card and personal loans finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, accelerating total loan growth to almost 7% over the prior year. Card balances were driven by increased sales, which were up 3%, a higher revolve rate on merchandise sales and higher promotional balances. Personal loans grew 18% over the prior year due to successful marketing initiatives and the product enhancements that David mentioned earlier. Student loans grew 2% as run-off in the acquired portfolios partially offset growth in the organic book. Looking solely at the organic student loan portfolio, it increased 13%, with strong performance during this year\u2019s peak season. Moving to our payment service segment, PULSE volume and network partners were relatively flat year-over-year while Diners Club volume increased 8%, driven by continued strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region. Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income increased $160 million or 9% over the prior year driven by a combination of loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Total non-interest income decreased $7 million to $466 million. Net discount in interchange revenue was down 3% driven by a higher rewards rate year-over-year. The rewards rate was up six basis points from the prior quarter and about eight basis points from the prior year. The increase over last year is driven by higher promotional rewards as well as a continuing [technical difficulty] Discover it, from our prior flagship cash back products. The increase in promotional rewards is primarily due to better customer engagement with the rotating 5% category which was broader than last year as it included department stores, Amazon and warehouse clubs. The Cashback Match program, which helped drive strong new account growth this quarter, also contributed to the increase in promotional rewards. In payment services, revenue was flat year-over-year. Overall, we grew total company net revenue by 7% for the quarter. Turning to Slide 11. Total loan yield of 11.88% was 39 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a 42 basis point increase in card yield. The year-over-year increase in card yield was due to a greater percentage of card receivables being revolving in nature, higher rates in the portfolio, the impact of the December 2015 prime rate increase and a few basis points from last month's rate increased, the benefits of which will be more fully reflected in the first quarter. On the funding side we grew average direct consumer deposits by $5 billion to make up 47% of our total funding. Our funding costs increased 10 basis points, driven by changes in funding mix as well as higher market rates. Overall net interest margin expanded 32 basis points from the prior call to 10.07%.  Turning to Slide 12, operating expenses were down $36 million over the prior year. But I would remind you that last year's results had $37 million in expense related to the AML look back project. Marketing expenses were down $20 million, due to lower deposit marketing, as well as a shift in the timing of credit card campaigns related to last year. Professional fees fell $18 million, primarily due to the completion of look back related anti-money laundering remediation activities earlier this year. Partially offsetting these expense reductions is a 90 million year-over-year increase in employee compensation, resulting from higher headcount to support compliance activities as well as the impact of higher average salaries. Turning to provision for loan losses and credit on Slide 13, provision for loan losses was higher by $94 million compared to the prior year, due to higher charge-offs and a larger reserve build, both primarily driven by the seasoning of loan growth. This quarter we increased reserves to $143 million, while last year we had a slightly smaller build of a $126 million. I would reiterate that loan growth is the driver here, on balance the credit back drop continues to remain benign with a modest level of normalization continuing. Looking at card, the net charge-off rate of 2.47% increased by 29 basis points year-over-year, and 30 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate of 2.04% increased 32 basis points year-over-year and was up 17 basis points sequentially. Turning to private student loans, the net charge-off rate, excluding acquired loans, increased 12 basis points from the prior year due to seasoning of the organic book. Sequentially, the rate increased 40 basis points due primarily to seasonality. Student loan delinquencies, once again, excluding our acquired loans, are up 31 basis points compared to the prior year and 35 basis points sequentially. The increase in delinquencies is primarily driven by a greater portion of the student loan portfolio entering repayment and the seasoning of loan growth. Switching to personal loans, the net charge-off rate was up 42 basis points from the prior year and 7 basis points sequentially. The 30-day delinquency rate was up 23 basis points from the prior year and 14 basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increases in the personal loan charge-off and delinquency rates were driven by the seasoning of loan growth, and a higher mix of customers who drive strong risk adjusted returns that has slightly higher losses. Across all three major asset classes card, student and personal loans credit performance continues to be generally in line with our expectations. Next, I'll touch on our capital position on Slide 14. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio fully phased in for Basel III declined 60 basis point sequentially. The ratio decreased from the prior year due to the capital deployment in the form of loan growth, buybacks and dividends. In the quarter we repurchased 2% of our common stock. Moving to 2017 guidance on Slide 15, first we've increased our loan growth target range for the next year to 5.5% to 7.5% above our long term target range of 4% to 6%, based on opportunities that we see to continue to drive disciplined profitable loan growth. In order to support that higher growth target we expect operating expenses to rise to approximately $3.8 billion next year. We've been saying for several quarters now that we would invest some of our NIM upside back into the business to the extent we could find profitable opportunities to do so, and we believe we have opportunities to do just that in 2017. Another driver of the loan growth is higher sales, there we expect to continue with focused innovations around our rewards program to drive engagement and growth in our target segments. As a result, we expect the rewards rate to come in between 126 and 128 basis points for full year 2017. Moving to our outlook for net interest margin, we expect it to increase slightly versus full year 2016's net interest margin. The prime rate increase from last month is not fully reflected in fourth quarter results due to timing. And that alone will result in NIM expansion in 2017. Further rate increases would also result in NIM expansion due to the asset sensitive position that we built into the balance sheet. And we are currently expecting a couple of more rate increases this year based on the market implied forecast. Somewhat offsetting the benefit provided by the rate environment will be the level of card promotional activity and modestly higher charge offs of accrued interest. Finally, we expect the total net charge off rate this year to be modestly higher than the 2.16% net charge off rate we delivered in 2016 due largely to the seasoning of a growing portfolio. Let me reiterate the overall consumer credit environment continues to feel benign. So to summarize we'll remain disciplined in our approach to loan growth, focusing on our core prime customers, while also identifying and targeting new customer populations when we believe there are opportunities for incremental growth with good risk adjusted returns. It is the pursuit of these opportunities that is driving the higher operating expenses I discussed on the prior slide. Payments volume is stabilizing and we expect it to return to single digit growth. We have a strong capital position that enables us to both continue to invest in the business to drive growth as well as deliver a strong payout ratio in total yield. And finally our business model continues to generate very strong returns on equity. Before I pass the call back to the operator there's one more piece of information I'd like to share with you. For the past four years Bill Franklin has done a great job at the helm of our Investor Relations function, but now it's time for him to take on new responsibilities. Effective February 1st, Bill will be assuming the role as our Assistant Treasurer, responsible for funding and rating agency relationships. Stepping into Bill's shoes will be Tim Schmidt who's done a great job serving in that Assistant Treasurer role that Bill will be assuming. Tim is well known among debt investors and I'm looking forward to introducing him to the equity community as the conference and road show season kicks off. That concludes our formal remarks, so now I'll turn the call back to the operator, Chantal, to open the line for the Q&A session. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs, your line is open. Ryan Nash : I was wondering if you could give us a little more clarity on the expense guidance, Mark you made some reference to a potential for higher marketing. In your remarks, I know David had made some comments about investing in some technology. Could you just kind of contextualize how much of the spending you\u2019re doing is to drive new growth versus core infrastructure build? And how should we think about the ongoing core growth rate. Is this an elevated year, just because of the fact where you said you\u2019re going to be reinvesting in the NIM and we should see expense growth essentially comeback down? David Nelms : Ryan, I would say that absolutely the driver of the expense growth this year is the investments in continuing to drive stronger growth rates across the portfolio. If you think about it on a core basis, we really pull out the look back on a prior year and compare it norm-to-norm. I would say core expense growth is somewhere in the order of 2.5% plus or minus. So it feels very well control from my perspective. The remainder of that expense growth is discretionary investment that is directly related to driving stronger production where we found opportunities to do just that. A big chunk of it is very aggressive marketing, we can always adjust that, if our returns don\u2019t come in as we expected them to on those investment dollars or if the environment were to turn on us. But we see great opportunities right now, building off of the strength in the fourth quarter and we feel really good about making that investment. Ryan Nash : Got it. And then just on your comment regarding the 5.5% to 7.5% leverage. You talked about new opportunities for customers with good risk adjustment. Could you maybe expand on that front, are you guys dipping down below the historical levels of which -- of where you played in the card business and how should we think about the longer term impact on charge offs related to that? David Nelms : No, I would say Ryan, I think about these things as really incremental where we\u2019re seeing great opportunities. So for example, if you think about a secured card for example. That's somewhere where you're going to have a lot of these customers no FICO or very low FICO, but because you\u2019re holding collateral, the risk adjustments return on that doesn\u2019t look radically different than our traditional portfolio. So that\u2019s just one example. We always look for opportunities where we can expand the box a little bit, but I would say this really reflects more a deepening of the existing strategy that it does expanding the box and really going significantly down market in any way. Ryan Nash : Got it. And congrats to Bill on the new role. Operator : Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you, congrats Bill. I guess my question is around the NIM outlook assumptions. Mark could you just talk about how much of this last rate benefit you\u2019re actually incorporating into this guidance of slightly higher and then the subsequent rating [ph] prices that may occur in the future? Mark Graf : Sure. So last year, if you think about and we had a very similar situation, where we had it December rate increase. And in Q1 that resulted in about 10 basis points of an improvement in NIM. We actually saw 20 basis points of Q1 improvement last year about 50% of that was due to portfolio mix, the other 50% of it was due to the actual rate move. I think it will be rational to assume that that same 10 basis points plus or minus flowing through from the rate move we saw in December is not out of the realm of rational -- wouldn\u2019t be out of the realm for a rational person to assume, is kind of the way I think about it. As we move on through the year, I think that kind of a cadence would hold, based on the current curve and the current expectations for promotional activity in the portfolio and the current expectations for interest charge offs. Right, so if you think about it the factors that are really going to influence it going forward are going to be, what happens market reach? What happens to the mix in the portfolio, both with transactors as well as with promotional balances? And then obviously charge offs have accrued interest flow through NIM, so that\u2019s a piece of that. And then the other piece that probably kicks in at some point Sanjay and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m smart enough to tell you exactly what it happens, but at some point in time deposit data [ph] will come back into existence. You know these first few rate moves, we haven\u2019t seen, we've seen essentially deposit data [ph] of essentially zero. At some point in time that will creep in a little bit, but I feel really good about the NIM positioning through the year ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : And maybe just one follow-up to a question I was asked previously. I mean cap ones talked about how the competitive intensity, domestic card lending is probably the highest it\u2019s been, yet you guys are accelerating your growth expectation. Can you just talk about why are being, why you're are so successful? David Nelms : Well, I think if you look at our fourth quarter results, we fairly matched the increase in loan growth with increase in revenue growth. And I think that that is as I mentioned in my comments pretty different than what we're seeing in some other places, it\u2019s really easy to give away your product in terms of rewards to transactors that doesn\u2019t produce revenue or the dipping down credit [ph] that just gets eaten up in charge-offs. But that\u2019s not our focus, our focus is on getting more our products into the hands of our prime revolvers and getting more usage in our portfolio. And so I mentioned that the greater number of new accounts last year was a big part of the increase in growth rate and that\u2019s everything from the new features, the advertising, the digital marketing. The new products like the secured card or expansion in student cards. And so as I think about this coming year, I think it will be more of the same. We are putting in more money, for more marketing, for more new accounts as an example. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open. John Pancari : On the expense front, I know just you had indicated that the higher expense expectation is driven by the higher revenue growth opportunities. So on that, can you just give us your thoughts around where you think the efficiency ratio could go over time and how you may be looking at it for 2017. I know we're coming off a level of about 40% for '16. I mean do you think it remains around there, do you think you could actually see some improvement? Thanks. Mark Graf : Yeah, I think you\u2019ll see some improvement as you head into 2017, my current though process is we wouldn\u2019t get all the way to the 38% target given the level of investment we're talking about driving this year, but I do think you get to a 39% handle next year, based on where I see the crystal ball right now. Don\u2019t take that as guidance, throughout the year that will change and our expectations there and everything else. But I think it\u2019s a reasonable expectation to have as we sit here at this point in time and we\u2019ll obviously keep you posted as we go through the year. The other think I\u2019d really reinforce to support that is that, a big chunk of this increase in expenses is directly related to aggressive marketing dollars and if we don\u2019t see the returns on that investment that we expect, or if the environment turns on us, we won\u2019t hesitate to pull that back and that would obviously have a positive effect on the near term efficiency ratio. John Pancari : Okay great and related to that, the increase in the rewards cost that you see through '17, I mean does that imply any abatement in the level of marketing spend, is that -- are you\u2019re going to lean on the accelerator there as well? Thanks. David Nelms : Well I would say that, if you look at this past year, we had a similar order of magnitude increase in rewards cost and that is part of what produced the higher growth rate that we achieved this past year. So I think what we're kind of anticipating is some continuation of that trend. Some of it is just going to tend to happened as we get more of our customers converting in to Discover it, which has a higher average earn rate then our previous flagship product. And part of it is the continuation of our very successful promotional double match program and the 5% program that we're continuing to aggressively market and it's still a very good headline rate in a very good value to consumers who take full advantage for that. Mark Graf : And even the rewards isn\u2019t an expense, it shows up as a counter revenue. We kind view that and the expense side as flip side to the same coin. They're both really about driving customer awareness, customer engagement, so we kind view marketing and rewards investments as inner changeable to integrate [ph]. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. David Ho : Just want to talk about were the growth may be coming from a vintage stand point. I know you've done a lot of new customer acquisition with Discover it, it's been very successful for you. Just want to understand the mix of growth as it relates to that and kind of implications on some of the seasoning of that growth in your guidance for credit for 2017? Thanks. Mark Graf : Yes, David if you think back a few years ago, when we were talking at conferences and on conference calls, we were talking about roughly 50% of loan growth coming from new accounts and roughly 50% coming of the legacy back book. Defining new accounts is on the books three years or less for this purpose. I would say today that mix looks more like, let's call it 75 :25, 70:30, something in that range, skewing for the new accounts. So new accounts are a greater portion of the loan growth at this point in time and that does have some effect on the provisioning guidance. That said, I view it as thinking with an intermediate and a longer term mindset, a very positive thing, because in a lend-centric business model the way you compound the value of the business is to actually grow loans. And I think the seasoning of loan growth that comes from new accounts is just a natural function of the business, the attraction of new customers into the franchise and natural funds for the business so. And I think I tried a really emphasize -- I think I really tried to emphasize at the end of it in my comments, that what we see is growth driven provisioning. As we look ahead growth driven credit drivers as we look ahead in the coming year. And not something that reflects any type of [indiscernible] in that credit environment. David Ho : That\u2019s helpful, and then switching gears a little bit, back to the 5% rewards categories. It's been very successful, you guys started that category really and others have copied, but do you think the value prop could get diluted a bit by some of those categories like Amazon and department stores essentially having some of the private label players and co-brand players provide kind of ongoing rich rewards in those categories and some of those customers are rotating out of your 5% into those ongoing categories that they provide. David Nelms : Well certainly we continue to evolve how exactly, what's in the various categories, how we market it and we're going to continue to keep this program fresh, it's changed a lot from when we originally launched it a number of years ago with the 5% program. And I guess I would say that it feels to me like notwithstanding a few examples like you mentioned more of the competitors seem to be moving to just the flat 1.5% than anything else. So you know there's a few outliers, a few 5% there's you know, in one or two cases there is the 2%, but mostly it seems like it\u2019s the 1.5% and our 5% program works well there, and I think the proof is in the results. If you -- certainly the competition got a lot tougher last quarter and yet we accelerated growth and so we're going to continue to have that kind of focus to you know thrive in this competitive environment which I think is here to stay. Mark Graf : And we very focused on an overall value proposition as opposed to competing on the basis of headline and rate, right. So it's also about ease of redemption, dollar threshold to redeem, we removed all those things. So it's not just about the what's the headliner and it's a thing, you actually use it, right. Then we also have merchant funded rewards as a result to having our own network, that kind of sit in there where we drive some incremental value that's funded by the merchants, [indiscernible] our P&L. So we feel the bias is fully going to be upwards, hence our guidance that we gave. But we feel really good about our ability to compete in that space without chasing headline or rates. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities, your line is open. Eric Wasserstrom : Two quick questions please Mark, and I know historically you guys have pointed to about half your growth coming from new accounts and half your growth coming from incremental lending from existing accounts. So I'm wondering with the investment and growth in new accounts that you've seen over the past recent periods, if that ratio has changed at all? Mark Graf : Yes, it's running right now somewhere 75-25, 70-30 somewhere in that range. I don\u2019t have the exact number at my fingertips, but it's in that general range and as we continue to invest in and drive growth we would expect it to continue to remix slightly toward the new account side of the equation as well. Eric Wasserstrom : Great, and then just one question to follow up on NIM, how should we think about the sustainable NIM with respect to the current forecasted Fed funds, et cetera. I know that in the past you've pointed to a 9-ish, on a 9% handle, has that moved sustainably higher in your view? David Nelms : I would say the nature of the business model we did not move our long term targets on any of our longer term stuff in our call today, including that margin guidance. The real reason there is because I don\u2019t think, we can lose sight of the fact, we are at cyclical business and as we go through cycles, we will see NIM look different than it does today. That notwithstanding I would say absent a cycle, triggering it would be a long path from here to that 9% longer term guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel. Your line is open. Chris Brendler : A question on the NIM guidance again. I noticed what looks a bit, but the cash advance volume was up significantly quarter-to-quarter. Just want to know how much of the reinvestment and marketing is going to be on seasonally rate market in the card business. And then also, I guess, I would think that personal loan portfolio doesn\u2019t really get the benefit of higher risks [ph]. And with the buildup [ph] there is that also a drag on the NIM going forward? Thanks. Mark Graf : I would say, you are correct in the assumption that you had some higher promo rates in the -- prime promo in the mix in the fourth quarter, but it\u2019s really more balanced transferred than cash advance, is what you saw coming in there. Than I would say we pulled back significantly on our balance transfer programs early in last year, it\u2019s part of what pullback our growth rates, because we weren\u2019t finding the right time engagement out of these programs. I think we\u2019ve cracked the code or at least we believe we\u2019ve cracked the code at this point in time to be able to come back into market with a more robust balance transfer offering, but I would say balance transfers are far from the lynch pin associated with the growth strategy we\u2019ve laid out, they're a component of it. But really focusing on merchandise sales, building balances the old fashion way of customers engaging with the card and using products remains the core piece of the puzzle. As a results to NIM, I would say the current level of promotional activity, that is contained in our plan and then we are moving forward with I would say is more robust than what we\u2019ve had years past, but that\u2019s fully contemplated in the NIM guidance that we gave in the earlier thoughts on this call that I provided in response to an earlier question about the trajectory. So I continue to feel very good about the way are our NIM is positioned, to be able to support both our growth initiatives, as well as create further value to our shareholder. Chris Brendler : And the personal loan book? Any impact there was meaningful enough? Mark Graf : I think you faded again Chris. Chris Brendler : I just wanted to -- cards are mostly -- I would assume that personal loans are not variable rates. So you don\u2019t get [indiscernible] as a NIM. You\u2019re also growing that portfolio; it looks like pretty aggressively. Is that a rate based strategy or is there an easy in competitive environment, that caused the spike in growth, it sounds like there were some strategic changes and some breakthrough maybe that help as well. But it sounds like [Multiple Speakers] relative to guidance, so that\u2019s going to continue in \u201917? Mark Graf : Yes. We do intend to continue growing the personal loan book as well, I think that\u2019s fair. It is a fixed rate book, but it is a very short duration book. It's somewhere two-three year kind of horizon if you will and we intend to -- well we don\u2019t match fund, loan-by-loan, we do think about our businesses holistically as we fund the balance sheet and I would encourage you to think of us as really kind of match funding. That personal loan book is the way we think about it. So and given the short duration and the correct turn in that book it really doesn\u2019t have a deleterious effect on NIM to any significant degree. So I would say that again is contemplated in the guidance that we\u2019ve got out there. In terms of where the growth is coming from, no it\u2019s not rate driven gain. I would say it's coming from some product enhancements that David alluded to in his earlier comments and I would say, it\u2019s also coming from the fact that we have increased the maximum loan size we're willing to do there modestly, the maximum loan size we are willing to do there modestly at the $35,000 that\u2019s a modest driver as well. But it\u2019s really more the features and benefits and some of the product enhancement that\u2019s been the driver there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is open. Bill Carcache : The 10% year-over-year decline that we saw this year in your marketing and business development expenses that certainly support that you guys have indeed been more judicious with your investment spending relative to some other who've been stepping on the gas on marketing spend and perhaps not been getting as much return on that spend. But now as we look ahead at 2017 and think about now this increase that you guys are talking about in marketing investments that you have planned. How do you ensure that you\u2019re getting an acceptable level of bang-for-your-buck on your spending? Maybe are there any principles underlying your investment spending that you could parse out for us. And I\u2019ll ask my second question because it\u2019s related, maybe if you could share any data points on how the cost per account acquired at Discover is trending versus the rest of the industry that would be great. David Nelms : Well, on the first part of the question, Mark I'll let you do the second part. We are very judicious in terms of looking at what the expected marginal return is for every effort we do and whether it\u2019s segments that we're targeting in direct marketing or decisions that we're making in promotional rate duration or rewards investments, where we evaluate those and we do a lot of test and control, we back test to see how things are working and we decide whether to modify or extend things or curtail them. So I think that the -- the thing that I\u2019m noticing, and I\u2019m sure other people do, somewhat the same. I think what someone of the mistake that I think sometimes people make is more transactors than expected, the interest income doesn\u2019t come through as expected and you've still got the expenses in terms of marketing or rewards cost. And I -- what I -- speaking from a lot of experience I think that\u2019s somewhat what I\u2019m observing elsewhere, where they\u2019re driving volume but not revenue. Mark Graf : And with respect to CPAs, what I would say is we\u2019ve seen very, very modest increases in CPAs maybe 1.5%, 2% over the course of the last 12 months let's call it. We are very focused on CPA, we've deemphasized some of the aggregator channels, because we saw some real run there shall we say. So I think in that basis, if you think about a card account when you\u2019re booking it and the long term value that card account, think of it like a NPV [ph] stream and that CPA that you\u2019re booking upfront, the value that -- the net present value of that card account is highly dependent upon what you paid to acquire it. So we are laser focused on CPAs and actively finding ways to drive growth in fashions that doesn\u2019t cause us to make crazy terminal value assumptions to make the NPV [ph] on these card account acquisitions work. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s excellent. Can you give the color on how that\u2019s trending versus the rest of the industry, because in particular given the comments that you guys made maybe there are some cases where the customer account could be elevated, but that retention of the customers isn\u2019t there and so any color relative to the industry, that you can give? Mark Graf : So I would say, we don\u2019t disclose our CPAs, so I have to be really careful in terms of how I answer it. What I would say is looking at Argus [ph] and certain other data providers, who try and triangulate on us and estimate, I would say, if you exclude sub-prime, where the CPAs are very low, because these are very active credit secrets, right? So exclude sub-prime for second, focus on prime borrowers. The data that I've seen out there anecdotally would say other CPA's are considerably higher than our, but that is anecdotal and I would not encourage you to relay on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is open. Mark DeVries : I was just hoping you could provide a little more color on what you mean by modestly higher in terms of total net charge-offs, should we expect something along the lines with the 30 bips year-over-year increases on the first quarter? Mark Graf : So I gave a lot of thought to how to answer this question, because we figured it was coming. I guess what I would say Mark is, your bunny seems to have a pretty good nose. The way I was going to describe it was to say, well last year we describe we expected a slightly higher increase and it ended up being 15 basis points year-over-year. And the way I was proposing to answer this question was to say well modestly higher, probably means slightly higher than slightly higher. So I would say, you're probably in the right relevant range. Somewhere in that neck of the woods is, based on everything we see right now, the right way to be thinking about it. And may be just the tad higher than that. But on balance again, its driven by the seasoning of the growth and not by a deterioration in the fundamental environment for credit that we see out there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Moshe Orenbuch : I guess David, in most of the industry is actually growing spending volume several percentage points; 2, 3 percentage points faster than balances and you've actually got the opposite. So could you talk a little bit about actually how you're achieving that? Is that likely to continue over the next couple of years, how do you sort of think about that? And then I got a follow up. David Nelms : We look at -- you would understand a lot more in the industry if you could really see what's going on with transactors versus revolvers by issuers, because if you could look our sales growth in our revolving base, the sales growth is actually very similar to the loan growth in our revolving base. So what's happening is, there is some people out there with very rich rewards that are attracting transactors and that\u2019s why, you're seeing it not cost us revenue and not build revenue, where that generally were proportional to the sales growth that they're achieving. So it's a remixing and it's a purposeful strategy on our part to focus on profitable business. Moshe Orenbuch : Just a follow up, and when you look at those 5% categories. I think there are some people particularly, our side of the world here, who think of that as an area in which card holders tend to gains that or would focus their spending in those categories. So you're saying that you don\u2019t actually see that? That isn\u2019t like a source of, kind of excessive transactor activity? David Nelms : I would say that, we have had a 5% program for a number of years and have good experiences with it. I think we would find it problematic to give 5% on everything without restrictions because the economics just would not work. And so we have been -- we have used it to help engage our customers to give rewards in rotating categories that has helped to encourage our customers to use their Discover card across many categories versus just being concentrated in one or versus just gaining it as you're saying. But I think that -- look I mean we started -- we were the first rewards card there was back 30 years ago and so I'd say we have the most experience of anyone in the industry, we've seen people introduce things then have to pull them. You know the original 5% program was actually, if you go back to the General Motors program which isn't around anymore and so you've seen some things that worked for a while in terms of volume, but didn't work from a profitability perspective and then they were curtailed. You haven't seen that from us, you've seen us be able to maintain a viable program even with the higher rewards cost that we've been talking about last year, we grew earnings a lot and so we\u2019re not -- we're balancing a great value for consumers and profitability. The final thing I would say is you need to be careful, as Mark mentioned earlier, not to get hung up with just rewards. It is more than just the rewards, it's great service, it's other features, it's how you work with credit and make sure you're going to people that don't get over extended, there is a bunch of pieces here and rewards is an important, but just one piece of the puzzle. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks very much and congrats Bill. Operator : Your next question comes from Don Vendetti with Citigroup, your line is open. Don Vendetti : Yes, Mark, I was wondering if you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about capital return this year going into CCAR. I think you had made some comments about the debt rating agencies or debt markets being a binding constraint or the new binding constraint. It seems like investors are a little cautiously optimistic that if you get higher payout ratios, can you just talk a little bit about that? Mark Graf : Yes, I think you know, last year again we had one of the highest total payouts and I think the highest effective yield amongst the CCAR participants, so we feel very good about the fact that we've been prudent stewards and are driving responsible loan growth and also trying to return excess capital that we don't need as effectively as we can, we have taken up our payout request to the CCAR process every year we've participated in it so far. I think it would be reasonable for one to expect we would not want to break that trend. So I think you should look for us to get more aggressive again this year. We take with great happiness some comments that Governor Tarullo has made over the course of the last several quarters, where he's really talked about differentiating between the GSFVs [ph] and the -- what I'd call the mid-tier CCAR participant in terms of the expectations there and some thoughts around the qualitative process. So I feel really good about what we've done in the past and I think you know we would look to get progressively more aggressive this year as well consistent with prior years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Hesh with Jefferies, your line is open. John Hesh : Evening, thanks very much guys and congratulations Bill. Question, is the ending payout of rewards 127 is pretty consistent with the overall guide for this year. So I\u2019m wondering number one, do you think at least in terms of incremental changes, the worse is behind you with respect to rewards expansion [ph] or is there some season and I'll admit, we need to think about with respect to the guide? Mark Graf : There is definitely a seasonal element associated with it. I would say, a big piece of it is what is going on with our 5% rotating categories and what we choose to include in this category. So we choose to include warehouse clubs for example in our fourth quarter program that haven\u2019t historically been in there in the fourth quarter, in the past. So we will make decisions around engaging, the customer to drive the kind of behaviors that build the loan volume that kind of drives the profitability in the long run. So that piece of the puzzle definitely flows through, so you will see variability based on that. The other big drivers really are going to be, obviously, the cash back mash program that we\u2019ve got running on new accounts is a piece that I would say that would be really more consistent -- be more consistent with the growth in new accounts, really just as we have every month another vintage that laps one year in the process and another vintage that's larger than the one that's leaving coming on, because thus far every year the vintage of new accounts has been larger than the ones that preceded it. And then the last driver is really going to be our legacy more card product, when we launched Discover it, all the new account acquisition since that point in time have come on it. So you also have a natural migration in the portfolio. A greater portion being it cards as opposed to more cards and they have a slightly more lucrative reward proposition associated with them. So those were really the drivers. I'd echo David\u2019s comment, the increase in a full year basis this year is about right in line with the increase on a full year basis last year, significantly below the headline earn rates that you're seeing out of others and we like that, we\u2019re choosing to compete on our terms. John Hesh : Okay. And then second question. Mark, I think you\u2019ve referred to kind of long-term loss rates in the 3% to 4% range in the credit card portfolio. And we\u2019re talking about moving -- it seems like you're moving towards 2.3% to 2.5% or some modest increase from last, this year. Do you think long-term rates, loss rates have changed because of certain factors in the business or it's just going to take a long time to get to the long-term range based on a benign credit environment? Mark Graf : Well, I think that we specifically didn\u2019t update our long-term guidance and I think this has been a struggle for a while, because there were definitely some factors the changed after the card act, after the consolidation, after a number of structural changes in the industry. And we kind of gradually took down that long-term expectation. Frankly, until we see a couple of cycles, we\u2019re not going to really know, and so we\u2019re hesitant to say what well the next cycle brings. But we are seeing this normalization that we\u2019ve been talking about for a while. It is slow and we continue to characterize it as a benign credit environment. And I think as long as unemployment rates stay very low and housing prices improve and the economy does well, you\u2019re going to continue to see below whatever that new peak is. There will be another turn and when it turns, then we\u2019ll see what loss is go to in the industry, I don\u2019t think it will be the previous weeks at all, but you almost have to see it to -- for anyone to really know how it\u2019s going to behave. John Hesh : Okay. I appreciate your perspective. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Grasek with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Grasek : Hey, couple of follow-ups. One is on you touch about the payout ratios, capital distribution. Could you remind us of what the capital ratios that you think that you could operate at if you didn\u2019t have the CCAR telling you what you needed to do. I thought it was in the 10% range, but maybe remind us of that and is that something as a goal you think over hit over the medium term. And the second question was just around mix between dividend and buyback and does your SKU change at all given how the stocks performed recently? David Nelms : Sure, so I will say with respected to target capital ratios, historically you are correct in that the binding constraint has been CCAR and that was on the order of a 11% Tier 1 comment [ph]. I would say an economic capital analysis would show you, we need something more on the order of nine -- let's call it 9.5% Tier 1 comment. I think the ultimate binding constraint probably lies somewhere between those two experience, Betsy. And I don\u2019t have a sniper rifle estimate for you today. But I do think it is really rating agency and debt investor driven. In terms of where that settles out. I think somewhere ultimately with some kind of a 10-ish doesn\u2019t feel altogether, maybe somewhere around 10, doesn\u2019t feel altogether wrong. But it\u2019s premature for us to really kind of revise guidance or kind of put that out there, but I kind of say that\u2019s the way they generally think about it. And obviously, we\u2019ll be working with rating agencies as our crack investor relations executive moves over to tackle that challenge, try and move their perspective on us as well over time. The other piece of the puzzle I would say with respect to the mix between buybacks and dividends I would say we run a pretty rigid analysis of our buyback program on monthly and on a quarterly basis really building on an efficient frontier and making sure the returns in those buybacks look solid. I think given where we are right now we continue to feel good about a healthy buyback program. That said, we have said we do want to be a dividend achiever over time. So I think you would expect to see us to the extent the economics allow for it, we would look to consistently increase that dividend on an annual cadence, again to the extent the economics allow for it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open. Bob Napoli : Thank you, good evening and congratulations Bill. On the regulatory cost, I was wondering if you could give us some feel for what -- how much of regulatory cost have been decreased from pre-recession levels and how much they could decline if you were to remove from regulatory costs, those costs that you view as probably not being beneficial -- incrementally beneficial to the regulatory side or to Discover? David Nelms : I would -- I think we're not prepared to give any kind of specific guidance on this. I would just say, I would characterize it as I feel like a lot of the build has occurred whether it's [indiscernible] specifically or regulatory CCAR, whatever. It feels like this year is going to be a little more analyzation of some of those expenses as we continue to ramp up very quickly this past year. But I would caution on thinking that it is going to go back to anything close to what it was pre-down turn, at least for us and I think for anyone. And frankly, I believe that some of it is going to be a big payoff for us. Because if we can have better quality controls to put in projects right the first time, to have things work more perfectly for customers every single time, to have better, more scientific understanding of our capital and what's important and what are the different scenarios. It's a lot -- we've become much more sophisticated then that we used to be and I think there are -- we focus on the cost and yes, you have to do it because you have to do it. But I think that, what we need to do is pursue efficiencies, but also pursue the -- even more importantly pursue the benefits that come from better controlled process. In much the same way, it's almost like, think about six sigmas [ph] in manufacturing. There is benefit that can come from this and we need to focus on that. Bob Napoli : Okay thank you, and just on your student lending business. Obviously, any thoughts on your discussions with your contacts in Washington DC on the potential dramatic expansion of the TAM available to you in that market or the potential for that to happen. I mean you've seen obviously the student loans stocks go through the roof and continue to do so, and some of your competitors and you guys would obviously be a beneficiary if those stock moves are indicative of the opportunity to come? Mark Graf : So to be clear you're talking about the student loan business, the addressable market? Bob Napoli : That\u2019s right. Mark Graf : Well I would say that, if there is more room, I mean the private student loan market has become pretty small and I think that\u2019s one reason that number of people exited from it and why there is only a couple of people left in it. And I think to the extent that, that there was a greater role for private lending. I think we would be very well positioned and I think the fact that, I think it\u2019s the round 6% or something of the total market and new loans are private and the other 94% or so are federal. And so it wouldn't take much in the way of federal backing of, to have a dramatically percent increase on the private origination side. And it is a very specialized business, from a credit prospective it's unique, from an operational prospective it's unique, because its distributed through schools with tight controls for it being used for educational expenses. There is a lot of regulations specific to it. And so I think it would be hard -- I think that we would feel really well positioned to take advantage of any possible increase in that market. Which I wouldn\u2019t expect this year but may be in subsequent years. I guess the final thing I would say is we've been investing a lot in the infrastructure, we\u2019re converting to a new system a little later this year in that business, which I think would be very scalable and flexible to be able to take advantage of whatever opportunities may come in future years. Bob Napoli : Thanks. Just a quick follow-up, this wasn\u2019t clear to me. Do you think rewards competition; do you see signs of it peaking or do you think it\u2019s another -- there is another step-up from there? I mean obviously Sapphire cut their rewards pretty dramatically on the origination, on the new account side? David Nelms : I am seeing, for every sign of someone cutting back, I\u2019m seeing something else that goes the other direction. I would just say some of these programs, whether you\u2019re paying out a flat 2%, which uses all the interchange or you\u2019re paying out a flat 5%, which uses over double what your income coming in is. Some of these programs just don\u2019t seem to make a lot of sense in the long-term to me. So I think the economics are going to causes this to be a peak maybe we're around peak now. I just, I feel like it\u2019s already gone kind of further than I would think that the economics really support, for some of these programs. But I think it\u2019s going to be a while before people cut back and part of it, as rates go up and cost of float for transactors become non-zero and as people see that what the actual mix coming in, in transactors versus revolvers and what\u2019s canalization of their own portfolios versus really new, people will than start to adjust and probably cut back some other programs to more reasonable levels. Bob Napoli : Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities. Your line is open. David Scharf : Yes. Good afternoon and thanks for squeezing me in. If I heard correctly, it sounded like your NIM guidance is factoring in the expectation of more rate hikes later in the year. I\u2019m just wondering switching to the regulatory side and as we think about your loss rate forecast. Are you building in any expectations of using regulatory -- using in the collections front and how should we think about some of the developments there? Mark Graf : The simply answer to that question is, no. We\u2019re not building in any expectations there at all. And I think we tend to be a pretty conservative straight shooting bunch. And at the end of the day, I wouldn\u2019t know how to create those expectations that I would feel comfortable laying into a loss forecast. And I think as we get more clarity on some of the proposals that are out there in terms of regulatory reform and everything else, we\u2019ll obviously be reviewing them and looking at them and trying to process where they all outcome together. But I think we need decisively more clarity on where all those things end up before we can rely on them, let's put it that way. David Scharf : Got it. And along those lines from a strict operational standpoint, one of the likely areas of change we seem to be hearing more or more about is with the new SEC nominee, is that the PCPA [ph] may reverse its ban on auto-dialing, predictive dialers, any automated technology for reaching cell phones. I know some of the debt buyers and collection agencies tell us that that represents a much greater C-change the collection productivity than anything the CFPB [ph] has been weighing on them. Since all of -- you don\u2019t sell any charge-offs, so since you\u2019re operating, I assume all of your collection activities in-house. If you were to -- if the SEC were to allow the use of auto-dialers and other automated technology for reaching cell phones, is that something that can be implemented rather quickly or is that more along the lines of, let\u2019s say a year loan project? David Nelms : No. I think that could be implemented fairly quickly and easily. It would -- in fact we\u2019ve had to spend a lot of money and go to a lot of trouble to restrict the normal operation of these things. And so it\u2019s a lot easier to tale that out. And I would say that one of the things we\u2019ve been doing is moving very heavily to digital collections and so that\u2019s less impacted by some of this. But it is definitely hard as so many people are using their cell phones as their primary phone. They don\u2019t have landlines anymore and the fact that we are required to have consent and then the fact that we've had to turn off our auto-dialers has introduced inefficiencies, which is driving up our expenses and it\u2019s also frankly caused some of our customers to not be able to get into payment programs that we may offer or the assistance we can provide to them, help them get back on their feet. So I think it would be a great thing for consumers, if we were able to reach them to help them stay current or get current, and it would be a great think for our operating cost and our collection results. So that would be a positive. David Scharf : Got it. Thanks very much. Bill Franklin : All right. That concludes our call. We\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us. And I\u2019ve enjoyed working with all of you. If you have any follow-up questions, feel free to call the Investor Relations Department. Have a good night. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Bill Carcache - Nomura Instinet Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Chantelle and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Discover Financial Services First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Tim Schmidt, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Tim Schmidt - Discover Financial Services : Thank you, Chantelle, and a sincere thanks to everyone on the call for joining us today. I'll begin on slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release which was provided to the SEC today in an 8-K Report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs which are on our website and on file with the SEC. In the first quarter 2017 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial information, and we explain why these measures are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question, so we can accommodate as many participants as possible. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to David, who will begin his comments on page 3 of the presentation. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, Tim, and thanks to our listeners for participating on today's call. For the first quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.43, up 6% from the prior year, and we delivered a 20% return on equity. Before I ask Mark to review the financial results in more detail, I'll begin with some comments on our vision and key focus areas and strategic objectives. In 2017, we're celebrating Discover's first decade as a public company. Throughout those 10 years, we've made great progress towards realizing our vision to be the leading direct bank and payments partner. This vision guides the choices we make and the strategies we employ to achieve our ultimate goal of creating long-term shareholder value. I mentioned some of our key focus areas and strategies for 2017 on our Q4 earnings call, and you can see them outlined on page 3 of our earnings presentation. We've organized our strategies around two key focus areas, achieving a strong rate of profitable, disciplined asset growth in the near-term, while investing in capabilities that will create a firm foundation for future growth. Growth is an underlying theme in both of these focus areas because profitable, sustainable asset growth is essential to create long-term shareholder value in our lend-centric business model. We have recently returned to faster growth because we deliberately slowed loan growth for much of 2015 and part of 2016, when for instance we curtailed our use of aggregator sites as the cost to acquire new card accounts in that channel grow significantly. In response, we developed and implemented several initiatives to return to the higher and more profitable asset growth you see today. These initiatives have spurred new account originations that are responsible for most of our recent credit card receivables growth. I would also note that we have established a long-term track record of managing our credit risk in a disciplined fashion. With our focus on consumer lending, asset quality has a large and direct impact on our bottom line. That's one reason why prudent risk management underlies all we do. In managing credit risk, we stay keenly attuned to changes in the credit cycle. While credit fundamentals remain favorable and the lending market has been expanding, we have been making more loans. We continue to focus on attracting prime borrowers and achieving strong risk-adjusted returns. With that context, let's examine our recent progress in achieving the strategic objectives in these two key focus areas. As cited in the highlights on page 4, we made substantial progress in the first quarter. In the focus area of profitable, disciplined growth, we produced strong loan growth momentum across all of our primary lending products. We achieved this asset growth without sacrificing revenue growth. As I noted earlier, we reported a 20% ROE, while growing revenue 5% from a year ago. We demonstrated growth in our payments business as well. Of note, PULSE volume returned to year-over-year growth in the first quarter and is well-positioned for further gains during the rest of 2017. We also delivered on our second focus area by investing wisely for the future. For instance, we continued to invest in our Cashback Match program, which is approaching its second anniversary. This program has proven a worthy investment by generating sustained customer engagement beyond the promotion period. Customers acquired through this program recognize the benefits enjoyed by all Discover it cardholders including an award-winning, all domestic customer service, innovative security features, pre-FICO scores, no annual fee and a competitive rewards structure. We also remained productively engaged with our deposit customers, many of whom have another Discover relationship as well. We achieved strong annual balance growth while holding deposit rates steady. Finally, to see future growth, we continue to enhance our operating capabilities and manage our risks prudently. Enhanced operating capabilities support features and benefits that serve our customers better, which in turn fosters growth through customer loyalty. I'm particularly pleased that the Brand Keys Customer Loyalty Engagement Index ranks Discover card first in our industry for the 21st consecutive year, a feat unmatched by any of the 740 brands measured in their respective categories. With respect to risk management, we remain good stewards of our shareholder capital and submitted our most recent CCAR capital plan to our regulators on April 5. Given our strong earnings and capital position, we expect to remain among the industry leaders in total payout ratio and shareholder yield. In summary, I'm pleased with the achievements to date in our 2017 focus areas and our profitable and disciplined approach to generate long-term value for our shareholders. I'll now ask Mark to discuss our first quarter results in more detail. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide 5. For the first three months of 2017, we reported net income of $564 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.43, up 6% from the prior year. David noted that we remain focused on profitable, disciplined growth and you can see evidence of that in the 20% return on equity we generated for the quarter. Turning to slide 6, total loans increased 8% over the prior year, driven by 7% growth in credit card receivables which represented nearly 80% of total loans. The increase in card receivables was primarily driven by growth in standard merchandise revolving balances. Loan growth remained favorable across our other primary lending products as well. Personal loans increased 20% from the prior year as we attracted strong customer engagement with our simplified application experience and check-your-rate feature. Student loan balances rose 3% in total, but our organic book increased 12% year-over-year. We continue to make investments in early-stage product awareness and marketing to promote student loan growth. Moving to the results from our payments network, Proprietary volume rose 4% year-over-year, driven by 6% higher credit card sales volume. Increased card usage and higher gas prices both contributed to this growth. In our Payment Services segment, as David already noted, PULSE volume returned to year-over-year growth during the first quarter with an increase of 4%. Diners Club volume rose 10% from the prior year on growth across all regions. And finally, Network Partners volume increased 2% from net-to-net and B2B payments activities. Turning to slide 7, net interest income increased $142 million or 8% from a year ago, driven by a combination of strong loan growth and a higher net interest margin. On a sequential basis, our net interest margin was flat. I'll explain this more thoroughly in a subsequent slide. Total noninterest income decreased $27 million or 6% year-over-year. The primary driver was a 15% decline in net discount and interchange revenue as rewards cost increased 24% from a year ago. Our rewards rate rose 19 basis points from the prior year, but declined 1 basis point sequentially. Promotional rewards accounted for nearly all of the higher rewards rate, with higher spending in our 5% categories driving most of the increase. At 1.25%, our rewards rate remains roughly in line with our 2017 guidance of 1.26% to 1.28%. Loan fee income grew $9 million or 11% year-over-year. Late fees accounted for most of the gain. Moving now to slide 8, our net interest margin rose 13 basis points from the prior year, but held stable from the prior quarter at 10.07%. Relative to the first quarter of 2016, a higher prime rate and higher shares of standard merchandise balance and revolving loans contributed favorably to margin, although the pace of growth in the revolve rate slowed from the prior year. These gains were offset in part by higher charge-offs and a more costly funding mix. Shifting gears and looking at a comparison to the fourth quarter of 2016, a higher prime rate added to margin, but was offset primarily by a combination of receivables mix, higher charge-offs of accrued interest, and modestly higher liquidity balances. Total loan yield increased 25 basis points from a year ago to 11.94%, driven by a 23-basis point increase in card yield. The increase in card yield was primarily the result of prime rate increases and a shift in portfolio mix. On the liability side of the balance sheet, growth in our direct-to-consumer or DTC deposits remains one of our primary objectives. Average balances of these deposits increased $4.8 billion or 15% year-over-year. At $36 billion, DTC deposits now fund nearly half our total loans. We intend to continue to increase this share over time as DTC deposits provide relatively low cost and stable funding, and are also viewed favorably by debt investors and rating agencies. With deposit betas below historic norms, DTC deposit growth will also help mitigate the impact of rising interest rates on our funding costs, which increased 12 basis points from the prior year, driven by higher market rates and funding mix. Turning to slide 9, operating expenses were flat relative to the prior year. Bear in mind, last year's results incorporated $30 million of expenses related to our BSA/AML Look-Back Project. We spent less on professional fees which declined $13 million in aggregate from a year ago. Employee compensation and benefits rose 5% from last year, mostly because of higher staffing levels, driven in part by regulatory and compliance activities as well as higher average salaries. Total marketing expenses rose a modest $6 million or 4% from a year ago. Increased acquisition and brand spending in card was largely offset by lower expenses in other areas. Marketing investments to support our card business as well as ongoing investments in rewards have been drivers of our strong loan growth. In summary, our expenses remain well managed. After declining 190 basis points from the prior year, our operating efficiency ratio for the quarter was just below 38% and remains one of the lowest in the industry. I'll now discuss credit results on slide 10. Excluding acquired loans, total net charge-offs rose 48 basis points from the prior year and 30 basis points sequentially, in line with commentary we provided on our fourth quarter earnings call and in public forums during the quarter. Credit cards drove most of the increase as net charge-offs rose 50 basis points year-over-year and 37 basis points from the prior quarter. Student loan net charge-offs, excluding acquired loans, declined 2 basis points year-over-year and 59 basis points quarter-over-quarter, reflecting seasonal trends. Personal loan net charge-offs increased 71 basis points from the prior year and 46 basis points sequentially as credit performance continues to normalize from historically low levels. Relative to the prior quarter, 30-day delinquency rates were relatively stable or declined across all of our primary lending products. We increased provision for loan losses by $162 million compared to the prior year, including a $97 million reserve build. While we continue to see some normalization in the credit environment, the increase in our provision is primarily the result of the seasoning of loan growth, which has been driven both by new accounts and to a lesser extent, growth initiatives directed at legacy accounts. On balance, the macroeconomic fundamentals underlying consumer credit performance remain favorable relative to historic norms. The labor market remains strong, home prices continue to rise, bankruptcy filings remain relatively low, and while rising, consumer financial obligations remain low relative to disposable income. While charge-off rates have risen, they remain quite low by historical standards and within the context of our 2017 guidance. Loan growth, both in recent vintages and to some degree in the well-seasoned portion of the portfolio, continues to be the primary driver of reserve additions with the remainder being driven by ongoing normalization. Once again, these trends are in line with our expectations. As David noted, we will remain disciplined and vigilant in managing our credit risk as we take advantage of current loan growth opportunities. On slide 11, you'll note that we continue to deploy excess capital. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 20 basis points sequentially, driven by the seasonal decline in risk-weighted assets. However, over the past year, it declined by 90 basis points, reflecting the impact of our strong loan growth and more than $2.4 billion of capital returned to our shareholders. As depicted in the chart, our trailing 12-month payout ratio exceeded 100% in the quarter. David previously mentioned that we submitted our CCAR capital plan on April 5, and I would note that we will continue to deploy shareholders' capital in a prudent manner that is consistent with our priorities : organic growth, dividends and share repurchases, asset acquisitions and M&A, in that order. To sum it all up on slide 12, we're very pleased with our operating results, anchored by revenue growth of 5%, a double-digit margin and healthy 20% ROE. In addition, expenses remain well managed as evidenced by a 38% efficiency ratio. Our balance sheet remains strong as total loans expanded 8% with significant contributions from all three of our primary lending products. We continue to fund these loans with an increasing share of consumer deposits while realizing the benefits of relatively low betas. Credit fundamentals remain favorable relative to historic standards with provisions primarily driven by the seasoning of loan growth. And finally, we continue to benefit from a strong capital position that enables us to simultaneously invest in profitable asset growth while delivering a high payout ratio and total yield to our shareholders. That concludes today's formal remarks. So, now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Chantelle, to open the line for Q&A. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Good evening. Appreciate the comments on the NIM, but I was just trying to get a little more clarity. Mark, you've talked about historically at least seeing some benefit from rate rises. As we look towards future rate rises and one that happened later in the quarter, should we assume that that will benefit the aggregate NIM? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yes. So, I think there were a couple of things that saw the aggregate NIM not get a benefit this most recent quarter, Sanjay, and maybe that's a good starting place that'll let me talk to the quarter ahead as well a little bit. So, if you talk about just the benefit of the moving rate, we saw about 15 basis points of goodness to NIM. The takeaways from that really were about a 5-basis point negative based on asset mix, promotional balances, transactors reengaging in the portfolio, and we also had a higher percentage of student loans that drive great risk-adjusted returns, but they don't have the highest yields associated with them. So, in combination, that took about 5 basis points away. Another 5 basis points came off due to the increased charge-offs of accrued interest. Then you saw about 3 basis points come off based purely on funding volume. We did overfund a little bit for the quarter. We were pre-funding for a potential portfolio acquisition we were looking at, that didn't come to fruition. So, we're lugging around a little bit of extra 10-year money that we'll grow into here. That was a piece of it. And then there was about 2 basis points as well that was really just netting of a whole bunch of positives and negatives. So on balance, that's kind of how you ended up flat on a fourth quarter to first quarter basis. We'll still have some of the impact of that overfunding as we head into the second quarter a little bit, but on balance I feel really good about our margin guidance of slightly higher on a full year basis. And we do indeed remain positioned to be asset sensitive. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Your line is open. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. Mark, can you clarify what your card charge-off guidance is for 2017? I think you've been thinking 30 basis points to 35 basis points, and I could be wrong, but it looked like Q1 might have trended a little higher than what you were thinking and just can you talk a little bit about that? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yes. I think what we've said is \u2013 we didn't clarify card. We gave total charge-off guidance, said it was on the order of 35 basis points year-over-year, something like that. And I think it's really being driven by two different things, Don. It's being driven both by a growth component and I'll call it a normalization component. The growth piece of the puzzle I would say every year since the crisis, we've had advantage of new accounts that's been larger than the one that preceded it and as you know well, new accounts season at loss rates they're above portfolio loss rates and that's part of the phenomena. We also have engaged in some growth stimulating activities over the last couple of years in the legacy back book. We have some seasoning of some new line availability there as well. And then the normalization piece of the puzzle that I would say is really more just eight years or nine years post the crisis. Folks have had the ability to encounter life events or get over leverage or whatever the case might be. So, as we've been saying, card books don't operate with low 2% charge-off handles on a normalized basis. I think we're just seeing some degree of that normal normalization creep into the book, but it doesn't feel like a cyclical turn. All the macro factors continue to feel really strong and that normalization relatively modest. In terms of the first quarter move there, I would say \u2013 I think it was pretty well in line with the guidance that we gave on our fourth quarter call. We said that it was going to look more and the first quarter would be lumpy and that we expected the increase in charge-offs to look a little bit more like the increase from third quarter into fourth quarter than what we were guiding for, for the full year. So as I sit here right now, I don't see any reason to revise the thoughts we provided around the charge-offs on a full year basis. That 35 or so basis points directionally is correct. It could be a smidge higher or a whisker lower, but in that general ballpark is the way to think about it. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. And just to clarify, the potential portfolio acquisition, can you talk about which product that was in? Was it personal loans, cards and is that a source of potential loan growth going forward? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : No. I'd prefer to stay silent on that one, Don. I guess the one thing I would say is given we funded it with 10-year money, it probably wasn't cards, but I'll leave it at that. Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask one thing related to the net charge-offs. As we look at the data and look at your roll rates in card from 90-day delinquencies into net charge-offs, seems like that roll rate is increasing. And then when we look at the data from your securitization which I know is a well-seasoned piece of business, but it looks like recoveries are coming down a bit. We've talked in the past before about this, Mark, but we finally worked through some of the recoveries related to the financial crisis, but are we not yet picking up recoveries from some of your recent loan growth? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yes. So I would say on the latter point, most of the charge-offs that were generated during the crisis have now passed the statute of limitations. So while we don't stop trying to collect at that point in time, the collection percentage does indeed decline. So I think, Chris, yes, you definitely are seeing and candidly that was the gift that kept on giving for an awful lot longer than it normally does, and to normally post a peak in charge-offs, you really have strong recoveries for 24 months to 36 months. This time we got them for bloody well close seven years. So, it was definitely the gift that kept on giving. As far as the rolls are concerned, what I'd really point you to is if you look at the trends and delinquencies in the earlier stage buckets, all continue to be really favorable. And that's really more I think the indicator of what's coming at you to be looking at and thinking about in terms of how we came up with our thoughts on our guidance on a full year basis. But in terms of just general loss development, it feels again, as I said earlier, like our earlier guidance from the last quarter's call. For the full year, it still feels like it's in the relevant range. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. And then just kind of curious \u2013 just a question on marketing, when I look back a year ago, you had a pretty low number and there was some talk about the timing of it. I don't think $168 million should be a run rate for marketing but, I mean, we should expect typical seasonal increases in that number, right? It's not that you're not taking the foot off the accelerator on marketing, are you? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : No. I would say that we were growing a bit faster as you can see. We're very pleased with the results of the marketing dollars and I would guide you to look at the rewards line and we do kind of think about, especially when we're thinking about promotional amounts, about where we get the best investments in marketing dollars directly, or in Cashback Bonus which attracts more customers more cost-effectively. And you can see there, we have increased our investment, and we do expect to spend more in marketing this year than we did last year. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. Got it. Thanks very much, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good evening, guys. Mark, maybe I can start off with expenses, so obviously they came in a lot lower than I think the Street had been looking for. David just referred to marketing expenses will obviously be up from this quarter and year-over-year. But do you still feel the $3.8 billion of expenses is the right number in terms of what you'll spend for 2017? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yes, I mean, I guess, Ryan, as I sit here right now, still feel good about the $3.8 billion. We definitely have leverage over that number, and if we see other things working against us that we feel a need to pull at, we can pull at those. And we've said all along, you've heard my three-engine aircraft analogy or the market's heard my three-engine aircraft analogy many times, and we can pull back on those throttles accordingly. There is a lag between spend and results, right? So, a lot of the growth you're seeing this quarter, yes, a lot of it's rewards, but a lot of it is also marketing dollars that were invested last year, that really kind of produced the loan growth you see on, on to this quarter. So I think there will be some seasonally adjusted marketing spend as we go through the year, but we will be very mindful on that expense line. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And maybe if I could ask one for David, many of us just got off another call where the outlook for loan growth is lower amid increasing consumer indebtedness, higher competition. So maybe just in both card and personal, can you just talk about the decision to accelerate growth where you're actually seeing good opportunities for growth, and do you think that you could actually sustain these type of growth rates in both card and personal? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Yes, well, if I start with card, we were growing two years ago, three years ago, four years ago, when the market was actually shrinking. And to some degree, it's a whole lot easier to grow when the market's growing than when it's purely share gain because the market is shrinking. So in some ways, the environment is better. Now it is clearly more competitive and you're seeing us, particularly in the rewards space, invest more in rewards in order to remain competitive, and that's paying off in these results. I did mention to you that in my prepared remarks, that a year ago we were pulling back from some areas where we weren't as comfortable with the returns, specifically some of the aggregator sites that had become very popular with some of our competitors, and that cost us a bit of growth last year, it gives us a little bit better comp for this year's growth, so that's also a piece of it. But, generally, we see great opportunities in the prime credit card market, and I'm not sure, the fact that we're not a subprime player, in my observation, is that market has gone through a lot more gyrations, and so people that are exposed to that may have bigger swings than we have. But in the prime space, we're pleased with the opportunities. More broadly, in the other products, you can see personal loans continues to grow very nicely, and when there's more loans outstanding, there's more loans to consolidate, and that is heavily a consolidation product, and so we're seeing strong opportunities there. I would expect that as variable interest, variable priced interest rate credit cards reprice upwards, that opportunity may continue as we consolidate in. And of course, tuition continues to increase in schools, and so we continue to find good opportunities to grow in our private student loan program. So I would say, all in all, while it's more competitive than it was, there's more opportunities than there were. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : And I would just pile on to that quickly with just one little comment, and David noted that we did pull back on growth last year or the year before, when we saw that we weren't meeting our return thresholds. We wouldn't hesitate to do that again, just to be clear. I mean, right now we are getting good solid growth. If anything, we've tightened credit recently, and we're still getting this really good solid growth. I think that's a key point, and I would also point out that as long as that's the case and we can make rational assumptions and drive good credit, loan growth is the key to compounding shareholder value in that lend-centric business model. So we really feel good about the growth we're putting up right now. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, both, for the in-depth answer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yes, thanks very much. Mark, just on the rewards cost, typically there's a decent amount of seasonality in that, and yet this first quarter comes in more or less in line with the full year guidance. So is this a change in the marketplace? Or is there something else occurring relative to the historical pattern? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : No. I think a big piece of it, Eric, really is the cadence on the rewards stuff, unlike a lot of the seasonality in the industry, is really under our control, right? So we can choose what programs we want to run for the 5% program in any given quarter. It's really the management set rate for lack of a better term as opposed to cyclical or seasonal factors that affect it. So really it was a conscious decision more than anything else. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : So does that suggest that at this moment your outlook is for more or less a sustained level of rewards expense? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yes. I would speak specifically because there will be peaks and valleys. So I'd speak specifically to the full year guidance of 1.26% to 1.28%. Still feel good about that guidance as we sit here right now. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is open. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Afternoon. Thanks very much. Mark, you talked about how the rewards expense payout was consistent with guidance, but looking at historical patterns, it looks like your rewards in Q1 is seasonally a little lower than the other quarters, so I'm wondering is the seasonality changing? Or are we just keeping our eyes open to what might come of the rewards expense ratio? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : No. Again, I would say it's really a management set rate. It's not really a seasonal rate, historically. Like last year, sometimes gas is in there, sometimes gas isn't. So I feel good about the full year guidance of 1.26% to 1.28%, and the first quarter was really again just conscious decisioning. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then all else equal on credit, with an even economic backdrop, unemployment and wage expansion and borrowing the rates where we are, would you think that 2017 represents kind of the normalization year? Or would you expect loss rates to accumulate into 2018 before they flatten out? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : It's David. I think that we're likely to see them continue to rise a bit, at least into 2018. I don't see anything dramatic as long as \u2013 as you point out, the economic environment is actually quite good. So with 4.5% unemployment and rising house prices, I think the normalization you're talking about is the driver as opposed to the beginning of a new cycle, but at some point, unemployment will start to rise and then that will start to impact as well. So we're really going to have to see another cycle before we know what the new normal is, and I would say for us below 3% charge-off rates continues to be well under our long-term business model. But I would also say that we think the long-term new normal is way below what it historically was before all the structural changes that happened with CARD Act and the consolidation and so on in the industry. So maybe a little bit of a long answer, but we're not providing guidance yet. But I would expect 2018 to be somewhat higher than 2017 as I sit here today. John Hecht - Jefferies LLC : Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Couple of follow-ups. Just one on the, what keeps you up at night kind of question. It sounds like things are going really well and you are still investing in growth and just want to understand, is there anything out there that keeps you up at night and slows down the growth at all? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : No. I sleep very well. Thank you. But I would say over my career, I mean credit is probably the single most important thing that I think we have to be diligent on. And that has served us well and will continue to be the thing that we probably focus on the most. And I'd say secondly, being diligent on pricing, rewards, sustainable rewards structures. One thing about credit cards is that \u2013 I mean our average credit card customer's been with us for 12 years, and so you really lock in a long-term relationship when you approve someone. And so it's important to take the long-term and not to get carried away by short-term fluctuations in the market. And we took a little criticism a year ago when we slowed down and others were starting to speed up, and I think it's paying off with us as we continue to grow our EPS and others are struggling to do so and as we continue to have a 20% ROE. So I would say focusing on the basics. I mean some people might point to technology changing or the competitive set changing. But I think people, when I observe what's gotten people into trouble over time, it's when they lose track of the basics of credit extension and pricing. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up on balance transfers, did I hear you correctly in saying that, that impacted NIM in part this quarter? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Promotional activity broadly did impact NIM a little bit this quarter, Betsy. So it was about 5 basis points was due to mix, was a detractor from NIM, and that was really three main components. It was partially \u2013 we saw transactors reemerge in the book to a larger degree than we expected. We did see some higher promotional activity with our double Cashback Match as well as some BTs. And then student loans picked up a little bit as a percentage of the overall book, and they're simply lower yielding. You make up for it on a loss rate, but it does have a modest negative effect on them. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And the improvement that you saw in spend year-on-year, that's a function \u2013 I mean that's also an output. Is that correct? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yes. The spend is really a function, I mean it was standard merch balances that drove the increase in spend. So it was regular way utilization of the card that we feel really good about. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. The efficiency ratio continues to be very good. As we look out over the next few years, is there still operating leverage left in this business? Can you drive that efficiency ratio lower over time? And if so, what's a reasonable way to think about that over the next few years? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Bob, I think our business model's kind of established at that 38% efficiency ratio target that we came in just below this quarter. And when you combine that with that other thought process that I shared earlier about the key to compounding shareholder value in a lend-centric business model is continuing to drive the right kind of quality loan growth over time. I'd be concerned about peeling back on muscle. And it's one thing to cut fat, start thinking about cutting muscle, you have other effects on the business. So we will always look for opportunities to be more efficient. We will always look for opportunities to find ways to protect the customer experience while doing more with less. But ultimately, I wouldn't propose to revise that 38% longer-term guidance that's there. That being said, that's kind of a separate question in one respect from the expense leverage because obviously, if credit does turn meaningfully against you, you have some giant geopolitical event, whatever the case might be. You clearly do have expense leverage in the model that you could act and react accordingly and appropriately. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. That's helpful. And then on the payments businesses, you did have some acceleration this quarter, and I think you lapped, got easier comps as well. Any thoughts on the ability to try to accelerate that business further? I still think it's well below where you'd like to see it on a longer-term basis. I mean the Diners Club had some pretty impressive acceleration. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Well, we do think there's opportunity to accelerate it past this. I'm really pleased that we returned to growth after a couple of difficult years mainly from the loss of one business from one very large customer. We don't have that kind of concentration anymore. And PULSE had a long-term \u2013 for many years after we bought PULSE, it outgrew the industry and the last couple of years have been very difficult as we lost some share and so we're taking all the steps we can to try to regain share. It's very tough when we got to deal with some of the things that a few competitors are doing, which are really hard to compete against without that level playing field, but I'm pleased that we're at least \u2013 that we're growing and looking to accelerate from here. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. The tax rate for this year, is it \u2013 the 35% tax rate in the first quarter, is that what you'd expect for the full year or... R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : No. We had a couple of settlements, some open tax matters in a few states in the quarter, Bob. I think sort of that 36% to 37% range is the right way to think about the full year. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Scharf with JMP Securities. Your line is open. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Yes. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Mark, I want to revisit \u2013 it's been asked a few different ways, but as you recounted the litany of puts and takes in NIM this quarter, you among other things mentioned transactors were reemerging in the book and a bigger part of the asset mix. And I'm trying to get a sense for whether or not \u2013 in your mind, as you plan your rewards rates, I mean, is that a leading indicator or any kind of red flag that perhaps the rewards spend may be getting a little too high? I mean is the transactor mix, was it very modest on the margin or is it a sign that tells us from an ROE basis there's actually room to potentially trim back rewards at the end of the year? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : It's David. I'll take that one. If you look at the \u2013 our sales grew 6% and our loans grew 7% this time. And so I think if you have that concern, you'd see sales growing a whole lot faster than loans because you're getting transactors that aren't turning into loans which some of our competitors have been chasing. So, I feel very pleased that our sales have gotten up very close to loans and that's been our target for a couple of years and we're hoping to maintain it and it doesn't \u2013 it more gives me a signal that our programs are working and we're moving to a nice balance as opposed to needing to change something from here. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And switching to the credit side, notwithstanding the commentary on normalization, I'm wondering within the personal loan category, was that sequential rise in losses from Q4 to Q1? Was that in line with your expectations? I mean, it was steeper obviously than all the other categories and it's steeper than anything that took place seasonally a year ago. Is there anything behind that? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : No. It actually was in line with our expectations. I think there's two pieces of the puzzle there. Piece number one is just simply the level of overall loan growth we generated over the period of time proceeding and leading up to that that really kind of goes through the peak seasoning and drives that, that's a piece of it, number one. The second piece of it is we did run a small test of some potential to set up a marketplace business for lack of a better way of putting it. So, we did originate some stuff that was a little bit lower than we normally would've played. It was a very small portfolio test and control. And that had an impact of adding a few basis points to what that reported rate was as well. It wasn't directionally the driver by any stretch of the imagination, but it was a small piece of it also. So, all consistent with our expectations and in line with our guidance for the full year as well. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Got it. And just real quickly as a cleanup, on the reserve rate, is the level we saw at the end of the Q1 a good way to think about for most of the \u2013 balance of the year? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yes. We always set reserves on a forward-looking basis, so I'm going to have to \u2013 I bluntly couldn't even tell you what my reserve rate was. But I can tell you roughly where it was, but I couldn't tell you exactly because we can't manage to it. So we're setting on a forward-looking basis. What I would say is, I \u2013 there's going to be that element of normalization that's taking place out there. It remains modest, but really it's going to be growth that are going to be the primary drivers of the growth in reserve and the provision expense as I look forward. And we're not losing any sleep that we can't manage the credit situation we're confronted with right now. David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks so much, guys. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is open. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thanks. Mark, I know you've been pretty clear on the big drivers for the upswing in charge-offs around both growth and normalization. Is there an element to which it's also being driven by a bit of a loosening in the credit box and maybe moving down FICO a little bit in your new growth, relative to what you've done, or have you really held the line on FICO scores and loss content? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : I think we've pretty well held the line. I mean, if anything, of the last quarter or two quarters, we've tightened credit, in terms of directionally where we've gone, as opposed to liberalizing it. So, feel pretty good about that. If you go back a few years, we've talked to market in the past about, we will look to expand the credit box a little bit from time to time. And if you go back a few years, we did a little bit of it. I think that's all performing in line with our expectations and we're getting paid for it in the NIM as well. So feel very good about that and if you think about it as the sundae, it wasn't the ice cream or the hot fudge, maybe it was the whipped cream or the cherry, is the way to think about it on the growth levels. So it was just marginal. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And then \u2013 sorry. One of your competitors in the student lending space reported slower growth, loan growth, for the quarter than they expect for the year, and they attributed that to kind of the disproportionate share of for-profit schools and the disbursement season for the spring. Are you seeing any kind of uptick in your share of for-profit schools and if so, any kind of thoughts on implications for losses going forward? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Well, it wouldn't be us because we don't underwrite for not-for-profit schools... Unknown Speaker : For-profit. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : For-profit schools, I'm sorry. And the first quarter is not a big quarter for disbursement, so it's hard to get a read, but we're seeing that we had expected somewhat higher growth this year in that business, more originations this year than last year, and so far we're seeing that. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. It's been asked and answered, but I wanted to come back quickly just to the rewards side of things. And maybe if you could just, David or Mark, talk a little bit about how you might use that, whether it's the rotating category or some other aspect, to kind of drive, and, David, you said you're generally happy with the characteristics. But are there any other ways that you can think about, kind of optimizing your performance in the coming year? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Well, because we have quarterly categories, we're able to be somewhat strategic and see what else is going on in the industry, what performance we've had in the past. And so, as has been talked about several times this time, we purposely went out with somewhat richer categories, the 5% programs, in this first quarter of the year, based on some of the things that we saw going on in the market, and you see the sales results in particular, show that those have been well received. And so, I think the 5% program is the one that we can change the most. I think then, the second thing is, the Double is continuing to work very well. We had originally put that in as a test, it worked, we've continued, and right now we have no plans to back off on that, and it's allowing us to get strong costs per account, strong engagement, and not be as wedded to some of the aggregator sites as some of our competitors are. And then the third piece is we continue to work very hard on the redemption side and growing the number of partners who help fund and provide additional value to cardholders, leveraging our network in a way that's hard for our competitors to follow. Now, it's not quite Cashback Bonus, but I'll just mention that we're really pleased that we're doing a program right now with Walmart that you've seen launch last week, I think. And we think programs like that is still rewards essentially, and it's cause marketing. And we don't have results yet, but we're optimistic that, that kind of engagement with our customers, with our retailer partners will pay dividends. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So, please, use your card at Walmart and provide a free meal. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Just a quick follow-up. You mentioned, David, the 12-year kind of average tenure, but part of the Discover, it was to attract a somewhat younger demographic. And can you talk a little bit about how that's going and what your success there has been because that's been kind of a hot (51:23)? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Yes. I'd say it's working well, and all of our marketing results and brand tests show that we do particularly well with Millennials compared to almost any other card brand. And so I would say we have a double-edged strategy. One is to grow, especially with the Millennials, but grow through new accounts. But the second is to retain our existing customers through better service, through lower charge-offs and through a strong rewards program. And it's that combination of not having a leaky bucket and then filling the bucket with new customers with a differentiated product with Discover it, specifically, that is working for us. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Henry Coffey with Wedbush. Your line is open. Henry J. Coffey - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my call. This is probably overly simplistic, but when we look at the quarterly trends and quarterly charge-offs, do you think that there was a sort of \"a jump\" in the second half of last year which will make the quarter-over-quarter comparisons easier as we go into the second half of the year? And I know you talked about it in the past, but is it fair to think of the March quarter as a bigger reserve build relative to the rest of the year? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : I'll let Mark answer the reserve question. But on the seasonality, I guess the way I would look at it is first quarter of last year was a pretty low quarter of charge-offs. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : It's the low point for delinquencies, early stage delinquency. Yes. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : And so that essentially is what you're describing and is what you would expect in order to reach the roughly 35 basis points increase for the full year. We obviously would not reach that if we have kept up the same year-over-year, so we would expect the year-over-year to moderate from here. Mark, on the reserve. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yes. On the reserve, we don't give provision guidance, so I'll steer clear of that one, Henry. But what I would say is we did give the charge-off guidance, and I think I can use that to answer your question. And really we did see a bigger bump in first quarter charge-off growth than we're guiding for in basis point terms for the full year. So clearly, that low point of delinquencies in the first quarter of last year is entering into our thought process. Henry J. Coffey - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: And then just kind of an unrelated question, but right now you have three core products that are driving the equation plus the direct bank. Have you thought about adding a fifth or sixth product to the quiver? Or is it really, you're going to focus right where you are? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Well, first I would certainly include the deposit products. I mean that's $37 billion of deposits from our customers, so I would look at it more like four. And even within deposit products, there's CDs, very different than money markets, checking, et cetera. But I would say home equity is the product that we are in. It's very small. It's a very big market relative to many other markets. I think we're coming into a particularly good part of the cycle in which home equity will be in higher demand as people look to use home equity as opposed to refinancing their very low-rate first mortgage. We're in the early days of that. We're still fine-tuning our infrastructure, our modeling and so on. So, it's not particularly significant today, but it is an area that we would like to grow further to create a, what I would call, a fifth product. Henry J. Coffey - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Insight into where the student loan market is likely to go relative to the federal programs, or... David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : We're not counting on any change today. I would hope that any changes that come in future years might be positive. To me, it is an unusual market and that 95% is provided by the federal government and only about 5% or 6% by private. And so, if the government backs off any piece of that market, such as graduate loans as an example, it's a market that we would hope could accelerate, and we would take the position to take advantage of it. And we are in the final stages of converting our system. We've talked about that in previous calls, and I think having a state-of-the-art proprietary system that's very scalable, I think could position us well for possible acceleration in future years. I don't know if that would be 2018 or 2019, but it's a great market, it's by far the lowest charge-off market for any kind of installment loan that I'm familiar with, and you saw that was the one product that actually improved this quarter and was the lowest charge-offs of any quarter that we've had in the last two years. Henry J. Coffey - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Harbes with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my question, guys. Maybe just a quick one on the longer-term credit outlook. I think at the last Investor Day, you provided a longer-term charge-off ratios target of 3.5% to 4.5%. Is that still a reasonable range to think about as we look ahead over the next couple of years? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yes, I think the most recent guidance we gave was back in January of last year and we said 3% to 4% is what we kind of expected normalize to be, so a little bit inside of that. I'd pick up on David's earlier comment, there's a bit of Kentucky windage in that estimate. None of us have been here in a post-CARD Act world before, with our books kind of having gone through the crisis. And all the cleansing that took place from that, coupled with the discipline that's kind of brought in by CARD Act. So we think that's a pretty good guesstimate of what new normal looks like through the cycle, but as David noted earlier, we're kind of going to need to ride through a cycle to validate that definitively. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for that, Mark. And then just a quick follow-up on the direct bank, looks like you guys have had some good success with your deposit-gathering efforts, while the deposit betas remain surprisingly low, at least thus far into the tightening cycle. Can you maybe share your expectations for what you're expecting for the remainder of the year? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yes, I think we'll probably start to step into normalized betas over the next several rate increases, I think it's kind of really a stair-step function. The money supply that's in the market has just got a tremendous amount of deposits in the system more broadly, and I think as the Fed begins to shrink its balance sheet, that'll have a bearing and an impact on that. I think to the extent loan growth continues across the industry, I think there will be demand for those deposits. So I think you'll start to see some betas kick in, but I do think it plays out over time. So as opposed to going from a beta of essentially zero to normalized assumed betas, I think over the next two, three, four, I'm not smart enough to tell you exactly how many moves you kind of stair-step your way there. Jason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, Mark. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Bill Carcache - Nomura Instinet : My questions have been asked and answered. Thank you. Tim Schmidt - Discover Financial Services : Okay. I believe that concludes the question-and-answer session on the call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today, and if you have any follow-up questions, please call the Investor Relations department. Have a good night. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Davidson & Co. Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets LLC Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Julie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Discover Financial Services Second Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Head of Investor Relations, Tim Schmidt. You may begin your conference. Timothy Schmidt - Discover Financial Services : Thank you, Julie, and a sincere thanks to everyone on the call for joining us today. I'll begin on slide two of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs which are on our website and on file with the SEC. In the second quarter 2017 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial information, and we explain why these measures are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Our call today will include formal remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up, so we can accommodate as many participants as possible. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to David, who will begin his remarks on page three of the presentation. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, Tim, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. For the second quarter, we delivered net income of $546 million, earnings per share of $1.40, and a return on equity of 19%. Mark will review the financial results in more detail in a moment, but first I'd like to update you on our progress in achieving our vision, strategic objectives and shareholder value goal which are outlined on slide three. We achieved our goal of creating long-term shareholder value by generating profitable, disciplined growth. In our lend-centric business model, profitable growth requires diligent management of several key metrics, such as net interest margin, operating expenses, credit costs and loan growth. We prudently managed our net interest income and operating expenses as our net interest margin and efficiency ratio ranked among the best of the industry, and are meeting or outperforming our long-term guidance. Loan growth over the last few years has contributed to rising charge-offs as those loans seasoned, but it has also generated strong revenue growth to mitigate higher credit cost. Loan and revenue growth represent our primary near-term opportunity to generate long-term shareholder value. With that in mind, I'd like to take a moment to examine the current operating environment. For the first time since 2009 industry-wide card charge-off rates have registered a sustained rise, we believe, driven largely by an increasing supply of consumer credit. Although our charge-off rate remains below the industry average and historical norms, we've responded by tightening certain underwriting standards over recent quarters. Major downturns in the credit cycle usually require an economic recession as a catalyst. However, microeconomic and macroeconomic conditions remain favorable for U.S. consumers, but with a robust labor market, rising housing prices, and manageable debt to disposable income levels. Therefore, we are taking advantage of these favorable conditions to grow loans to prime customers. Turning now to the quarter's financial highlights on slide four, we achieved profitable loan growth and faster payments volume growth, while making prudent investments for the future. All of our primary lending products contributed meaningfully to our 8% total loan growth, while we increased revenue by 9%. Notably, we delivered this strong and profitable growth, while holding the line on operating expenses and managing our rewards rate slightly lower. In our view, the level of rewards competition for prime revolvers, our focused customer segment, seems to have reached a plateau. In our Payment Services segment, volume increased 12% from a year ago, up from the 5% annual increase last quarter. I'm really pleased that PULSE volume returned to double-digit growth as our network team has secured more favorable routing and expanded our debit relationships. In keeping with our strategic objectives, we've also deepened and expanded our card member relationships by providing excellent products and services that meet our customers' needs with simple and secure interactions. I'm proud to note that in the recent inaugural studies by J.D. Power, our mobile app ranked highest in customer satisfaction amongst all U.S. credit card companies, and our banking services ranked second highest in customer satisfaction among U.S. direct banks. With features like freeze it and instant messaging, our mobile app provides the security and simplicity that our customers seek. We continually work to find innovative ways to serve and satisfy our customers. And just last week, we announced a new free feature that helps protect Discover card members from identity theft and fraud. High customer satisfaction contributes to growth through deep customer loyalty, so these awards validate our focus on the customer as a means to profitable growth and demonstrate our progress towards being the leading direct bank and payments partner. Looking ahead, we have a strong capital base to support our investments for future growth. Our strong ROE means we generate more capital than necessary to meet our near-term organic growth needs. So we continue to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In our recently announced capital plan, we raised both our quarterly common stock dividend and planned share repurchases, positioning Discover to remain a leader in total payout ratio and shareholder yield. In summary, we continue to make excellent progress in achieving our strategic objectives with a profitable and sustained disciplined approach to generating long-term value for our shareholders. Before I pass the call to Mark, there's one more piece of information I'd like to share with you. One of the architects of our disciplined approach to credit management has been Jim Panzarino, our Chief Credit Officer, who is retiring from Discover after 14 years of dedicated service. I'd like to thank Jim for his many lasting contributions to Discover, one of which was to build a deep and talented credit management team, this team which will be led by 10-year Discover veteran, Dan Capozzi, will serve us well by carrying on our strong credit management tradition. I wish Jim all the best in his retirement. I'll now ask Mark to discuss our financial results in more detail. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide five. For the second quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.40. For comparative purposes, I would remind you that last year's second quarter results included a benefit of $0.11 per share related to the resolution of a tax matter with the IRS. Returning to the current quarter, our 9% revenue growth was driven by a combination of strong loan growth and net interest margin expansion. The reported increase in provisioning reserves is consistent with ongoing supply driven normalization in the consumer credit industry, as well as seasoning of our last several years of loan growth. Operating expense remained relatively flat year-over-year, which in concert with revenue growth created strong operating leverage. David noted that we remained focused on profitable disciplined growth, and you can see evidence of that in our 19% return on equity for the quarter. Turning to slide six. Total loans increased 8% over the prior year, driven by 8% growth in credit card receivables, which represent nearly 80% of total loans. Growth in standard merchandise revolving balances drove much of the increase in card receivables spurred by strong sales growth, particularly among revolvers. We also achieved strong loan growth in our other primary lending products. Personal loans increased 22% from the prior year, thanks to active customer engagement with our simplified application experience and expanded digital presence. Given our recent tightening of certain underwriting standards in this category we do expect slower personal loan growth in the coming quarters. Private student loan balances arose 2% in aggregate, but our organic portfolio increased 12% year-over-year. As with personal loans, we leveraged expanded digital content to drive this organic growth. Moving to the results from our payments network, on the right hand side of slide six, you can see that proprietary volume rose 5% year-over-year. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in active accounts. In our Payment Services segment, PULSE volume grew at a faster rate during the second quarter with an increase of 15%. Diners Club volume rose 8% from the prior year on strength from newer franchises. Finally, Network Partners volume declined modestly on lower business-to-business volume. Moving to revenue on slide seven, net interest income increased $187 million or 11% from a year ago, driven by a combination of strong loan growth and higher market rates. Total non-interest income increased $60 million or 3% year-over-year, as higher card sales increased net discount and interchange revenue. We continue to manage our rewards diligently, lowering the rate 1 basis point year-over-year and 5 basis points sequentially on a decline in promotional rewards. At 1.2%, our rewards rate remains below our 2017 guidance of 1.26% to 1.28%, although we expect a modest uptick during the remainder of the year as we invest to drive holiday sales. As shown on slide eight, our net interest margin rose 17 basis points from the prior year, and 4 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at 10.11%. Relative to the second quarter of 2016, a higher prime rate and a lower proportion of lower yielding student loans bolstered the margin, offset in part by higher charge-offs and a more costly funding mix. Total loan yield increased 26 basis points from a year ago to 11.98%, driven by a 24-basis point increase in card yield, and a 32-basis point increase in private student loan yield. Prime rate increases partially offset by higher charge-offs drove card yields higher. Higher short-term interest rates were the driver of the increase in student loan yields. On the liability side of the balance sheet, we once again generated good growth in our consumer deposits. Average balances increased $3.7 billion or 11% year-over-year. Consumer deposit rates began to move slightly higher during the second quarter, rising 4 basis points sequentially. We do expect deposit betas will continue to rise gradually, and at a pace which is consistent with our margin guidance. Turning to slide nine, operating expenses rose just $6 million or 1% year-over-year. Higher employee compensation and benefits driven primarily by compliance related head count and higher average salaries was largely offset by lower information processing and other expenses. Marketing expenses declined $6 million or 3% from a year ago. Card marketing accounted for most of the decline, as deferred acquisition fees and lower brand advertising more than offset higher Internet mail expenses. In summary, we remain prudent expense managers with an efficiency ratio of just 38%, an improvement of more than 300 basis points from the prior year, impart due to the absence of $12 million of look back expenses in this year's quarter. This expense discipline coupled with strong revenue growth produced very healthy operating leverage in the current period. I'll now discuss credit results on slide 10. Total net charge-offs rose 53 basis points from the prior year and 11 basis points sequentially. Similarly, credit card net charge-offs rose 55 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points from the prior quarter. Private student loan net charge-offs rose 11 basis points year-over-year and 25 basis points sequentially, with the sequential increase in this portfolio being reflective of seasonal trends. Personal loan net charge-offs increased 80 basis points from the prior year, and 2 basis points sequentially. 30-day delinquency rates held relatively stable or declined sequentially across all of our primary lending products. In looking at total loan receivables, our 30-day delinquency rate declined 4 basis points sequentially, consistent with the seasonal improvement in the second quarter of last year. As we previously noted, supply driven credit normalization along with the seasoning of loan growth from the past few years have been the primary factors behind rising charge-offs. Incidence rates on our season card portfolio have remained relatively flat, reflecting the current benign macroeconomic environment. However, an increasing supply of consumer credit, and an attendant increase in consumer leverage have driven higher loss severities. Consequently, our net charge-off rate has increased somewhat faster than our original expectations, and as a result, we're revising our full year 2017 guidance on the total loan net charge-off rate to a range of 2.7% to 2.8%. In light of this revised guidance, I think it's important to remember that we have consistently noted that we have multiple levers available to offset some of the impact of increasing provisions when we deem it appropriate. For example, as you saw in this quarter, strong revenue growth and expense discipline can temper the impact of rising charge-offs on our earnings. So to assist in properly assessing the impact of this revised charge-off guidance, I would break from our custom of not commenting on EPS expectations. And note that we believe that the Street's full year 2017 consensus estimate of $5.98 per share is in the correct ZIP code. Looking at capital on slide 11, our Tier 1 common equity ratio declined 40 basis points sequentially, as risk weighted assets increased, and we returned more capital to shareholders in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases. Year-over-year, our CET1 ratio declined 130 basis points as we recorded strong loan growth and returned more than $2.4 billion of capital to our shareholders. On June 28, in conjunction with receipt of our CCAR non-objection, we announced our capital plan for the four quarters ending June 30, 2018. Specifically we disclosed planned share repurchases of $2.23 billion over the next four quarters as well as a $0.05 per share increase in our quarterly common stock dividend. One additional item to note is that beginning this quarter the payment date for the common stock dividend will be moved from late in the second month to early in the third month of each quarter. In short, we continue to actively deploy our shareholders' capital through profitable and disciplined asset growth, while at the same time returning a healthy portion in the form of dividends and share repurchases. To sum up the quarter on slide 12, we're very pleased with our operating performance. With half of the year behind us, we're delivering solid financial results, with 9% revenue growth, a double-digit NIM, and a healthy 19% return on equity. In addition, expenses remain well managed as evidenced by one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry. With regard to the balance sheet, we generated strong 8% total loan growth with significant contributions from all three of our primary lending products. We continue to expand our consumer deposit base to fund these loans while realizing the benefits of relatively low deposit betas. With respect to credit, while our charge-off rates have risen as credit conditions normalize in loan season, they remain below both historical norms and the industry averages. Finally, our robust capital position enables both profitable asset growth and a leading payout ratio and total yield for our shareholders. That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Julie, to open the line for Q&A. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess, the first question is on credit quality, obviously, it's been a bit more of a moving target this year for the worse. Could you just talk about sort of what specifically is driving this trend? And maybe just what drives your comfort level on the revised expectations, and what it might mean for next year? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Sure, Sanjay. I guess, I'd say a couple of different things. First of all, I'll just reinforce that by historical standards and compared to industry norms, credit remains exceptionally well below what we'd expect in either of those categories normally. I would say, what we're seeing is a combination of both seasoning of new account growth, as well as an increase in severity when losses occur in the back book. Up to this quarter it's been principally driven by the seasoning effect. In this past quarter we also saw an uptick in the severity elements associated with the back book. In terms of confidence, in terms of where we stand right now, I would say, delinquency rates have largely stabilized, and as you know, there are a very reliable predictor of what we think is coming at us over the course of the next six months, the remainder of the year. The macro fundamentals remain strong too, you got a very strong labor market, HPI is in good shape, bankruptcy filings in good shape, debt to disposable income in good shape. So on balance, we continue to believe it's two factors driving this, the first of which is the seasoning of new accounts, and the second of which really is the increase in the leverage that we've seen out there across consumers, so while incidence rates on the back book aren't moving, we are seeing movement in severities. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And as far as asset sensitivity is concerned, obviously we haven't seen a whole lot of it year-to-date. Could you just talk about how we should think about further rate rises and its impact on the NIM? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. I think in terms of what we're seeing flow through, the market rate element in this last quarter remained pretty consistent with what we've guided to before, Sanjay. So if you did the walk on a sequential basis from the first to the second quarter, market rates got you about a 13-basis point increase in NIM. The receivables rate was about a 10-basis point bad guy on margin, that was due to higher promotional balances in the card book. The funding rate was about a 1-basis point detractor, and then receivables mix due to a higher revolver rate in the card book got you about a 2-basis point good guy. So that's where your 4 basis points walk on a sequential basis comes from. So really, as you think about it going forward, I'd say that rough 15-basis point market rate movement for every 25 basis point movement, rates remains intact. The other things that affect it though obviously, that you got to keep an eye on our portfolio mix, promotional activity, charge-offs of accrued interest and deposit betas. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: All right. Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good evening, guys. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Hey, Ryan. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Mark, thank you for reiterating the back half of the year guidance. I guess, when we think forward, thinking about credit, I guess, on the back of Sanjay's question, loan growth accelerated the past 10 months to 12 months, which I'm assuming we haven't really started to see the seasoning component of that. If we were to assume no change in the operating environment, how should we think about the pace of credit losses as we start to look beyond the next two quarters, given that we have accelerated and we all understand the fact that there is a seasoning component, especially when you bring on a much bigger vintage? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Understood. Ryan, what I would say is, reluctant to guidance for next year until our January call, which is when we typically give guidance beyond this year. But I guess what I would say is, if I think about the type of credit we're originating, we continue to remain very disciplined in terms of what we're putting on the books. And all the vintages continue to season essentially in line with or better than our expectation. So we continue to be very disciplined in terms of how we're approaching the credit space. I would say, to the point of pulling back a few years ago, when we saw some of the channels we were originating and weren't generating the kind of returns we were before returning to the kind of growth we're seeing today, over the course really of that last 10 months to 12 months as you noted. The other thing I'd point out is, as we noted in our prepared remarks, we are pulling back on personal loan growth now, particularly in the unsolicited portfolio where candidly we're seeing some development that's not consistent with what we would like to see. So I think, we feel very good that we're booking prudent, profitable loans, that as we've said before in the lend-centric business model, are really key to compounding value over time. So I know that's not a direct response to what's the pace for 2018, we'll make you wait for that until January. What I would say that we feel very good about the growth we're booking. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And maybe a two-part question for David; one, the rewards costs came in better than we expected, I think, you talked about plateauing, you talked about it inter quarter that competition is turning to level off. Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing competitively? And then second, you guys did note that you tightened. Can you maybe talk about where you tightened, and what that could mean for expectations for a loan growth moving ahead from here? Thanks. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Sure, Ryan. Well, I certainly think that, if you saw the modest reduction in our reward rate this quarter, even with accelerating growth, that would suggest that we're not having to pay up more on rewards to generate that growth. And so that, I think is one indicator that I feel like over the last 12 months that that rewards competition after a big ramp-up has sort of plateaued, still at a high level. But I think that, we see that in those companies that report their number of new accounts and in marketing expenses, that the first half of this year, a number of people have pulled back a bit. And I believe that our discipline from a year ago, when we saw some cost per accounts, they got too high and the economics didn't make sense to us. Other people read some of those results, and have maybe made adjustments, which have allowed us to return to growth, while growing revenue even faster and keeping our expenses remarkably flat. In terms of where we've tightened, Mark mentioned personal loans. I'd say in the credit cards side, generally, because most of what we're now seeing, we think is more environmentally, it's not that we had credit issues. I would characterize as a pretty modest adjustments that we've made and it's really been on specific segments where we've seen some stress. And Mark talked about the higher credit expansion out there, we've seen certain segments where there was, maybe competitors have gone a bit far in the net effect to our credit as well, and the one place I'd point to is in personal loans. We've seen a lot of new players that don't have 10 years of data, haven't been through a cycle, lot of expansion in credit. And so we have a relatively small number of credit card customers who have personal loans with someone else, but those people have tended to underperform and underperformed what our expectations are, and underperformed what their FICO scores would otherwise suggest. And so we adjusted our models to help compensate for what we think is a bubble of outside credit that is affecting us. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for taking my questions. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Your line is open. Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP : Hi, good evening. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Hey, Brian. Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP : I wonder on the credit comments, so two things; one, just clarification, Mark, I think you mentioned you were seeing the delinquency stabilized. Were you referring to the year-over-year comps, or delinquency by vintage or what delinquency metric are you referring to? And then two, when you do look at the vintages, are there any early signs that second half 2016 or even first, like you said, were early first half 2017, but are there any early signs that the most recent vintages have started doing a little bit better than maybe the vintages from 2014 and 2015? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. So a bunch in there, I'll try and hit it all, if I miss something let me know. I will say, the stabilization in delinquencies comment that I made was specific to sequentially, as we've seen the delinquency formation really begin to stabilize, which gives us a high degree of comfort in the guidance that we offered at this point in time. We are seeing some stabilization in some of the newer vintages as well. So I would say, on balance, it feels like we're hitting somewhat of a new plateau at this point in time. That being said, the wild card is, as David noted, we got really good insight into our own growth driven provisioning, or our own growth driven credit delinquency statistics. It's some of the environmental stuff where we're seeing the severities that has been the unexpected piece, quite honestly, over the course of the year this year. If you think back to the end of the first quarter, the old guidance we had out there for charge-offs we were currently forecasting to be right at the upper end of that range. Over the course of this quarter we've seen the severity in the back book pick up, and really attributable to the overall leverage levels consumers are carrying. It seems to be managed, it seems to be controlled, debt-to-income ratios are great, the incidence rates are very stable. So it's just a matter of when folks do go bad and they have more credit outstanding, and so what's available to each creditor is a little bit lower. So it feels like normalization type activity, like we saw back in the mid 1990s. The last time we saw credit really normalize without a cyclical turn, and it feels like that's what we see Brian. And we continue to feel confident it's a good environment in which to be originating new loans. Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP : One follow up, if I could. I think over time you've been clear about some of the challenges with the aggregator channel that developed, I guess, sometime a year ago or maybe a little bit more. And I think you've mostly cited the cost to acquire accounts, as you kind of continue to read the data, has the aggregator channel produced any adverse credit results as well? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : So, I would say, at the margin, the aggregator channels have gotten a little bit more cost effective. But also we've moved away from us having a mix of aggregators. So some of our digital channels in particular have been very cost effective. So I'd say, in terms of the credit performance, I haven't seen any particular trend. It's been more of a cost per account issue as far as I know. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Although, the one thing I would call out Brian is clearly on a prequalified basis, credit continues to perform better than on an unsolicited basis. Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP : Perfect. Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Hey, Betsy. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: A couple of questions. One, Mark, earlier you mentioned that there is some offsets that you have to keep EPS in the $5.90 range. Can you just go through some of what those are? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. So we've talked about levers over the last couple of years that we have available when these things happen, I mean, two of them I think you saw some evidence of in the last quarter, that being our ability to drive revenue growth, but really also our ability to be extremely disciplined around the expense line. I would say, beyond that, Betsy we debated giving a truckload of guidance or a little bit of guidance, and we really went to kind of highlighting with that $5.98 a share number the Street out up there felt like it was in the right ZIP code. What I would say is all the levers that we referred to are operating in nature, nothing cute intended in their like one-time tax items up our sleeve or anything like that, really are operating levers we have available on both, I guess, the volume side, the margin side, the expense side, any number of different drivers. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : And I would just add Betsy, that overall if you look this quarter at a 9% revenue growth, and only a 1% expense growth, that's the operating margin that Mark is referring to, and that higher profit covered a lot of the provision increase. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. I know, definitely saw that, and yeah, that's part of the reason I was asking the question because not sure how much more operating leverage like the kind we saw this quarter is in the back pocket so to speak. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. I guess, what I'd say in that regard is, we will see a little bit of drift up in expenses in the back half of the year from where we are right now just because of the seasonal spend if you have in the back half of the year to drive holiday spending in sales. That being said, I think a wise person would assume that expenses are one of those levers that relative to our plan for this year, for expenses, we will probably be pulling on. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, just one other on the credit, you mentioned the bubble of credit that's impacting right now. Are we one quarter in, two quarters in, how far in do you think you are? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Well, I talked about one specific piece, but if you look at credit cards, if you were to look across the credit bureaus, the total credit card lines outstanding, there was a contraction up until about 2013. And then there has been a pretty sizable increase since then, it's disproportionately gone to transactors, so it hasn't fully shown up in \u2013 a lot of it hasn't shown up in balances. But one estimate I saw was, there is about 30% higher credit lines available today than in 2013 in the card business, and some of that will show up in additional risk. It's on average to less risky people, but there is more available out there. And at the margin, you'll get some people that could get into too much debt. And so higher credit availability affects all creditors, and that's one of the things that we talk about, supply driven normalization, to some degree, we've had a couple years of returning to normal credit availability post crisis, that's going to drive a move towards more normal credit charge-offs for everyone. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : And Betsy, the one thing I would say is, just to give you some comfort, I'd reiterate my earlier comment that we saw, we've seen delinquency rates on a sequential basis really kind of level out, and the delinquency formation seems to have stabilized. In addition to that, the macro factors all remain very positive, and incidence rates which is a critical piece of the puzzle, incidence rates in the back book are relatively flat. So it doesn't need to appear to be anything cyclical, anything embedded. It's really on a percentage basis, just the people who are going bad are carrying more balances. The other thing I think that's relative to this is, I think we've been pretty transparent over the course of the last couple of years, that we chose not to participate in the rewards war for the high spend transactor. And as a result, I think we've been pretty transparent, we've lost some transactor volume. That clearly will show up in the credit related rates that we discussed, delinquency charge-off, all those things, just because you don't have those balances in the denominator any longer. But the one thing I would point out is transactors also don't tend to drive a lot of losses. So one thing I encourage everybody to think about is, there is a difference between the rate and the dollars of loss, a bit of a disconnect there that having made a decision to let some of those high spend transactors to trade, I don't think the dollars of loss we face in our P&L will be radically different. The rates will look different, again, just because of that denominator effect. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : But they also don't drive net revenue. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Correct. Absolutely, correct. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, just lastly, can you just give us a sense as to the kind of things that you've done to tighten up as you saw this happening? What measures did you take on either underwriting or line size, or did you freeze lines? I'm just trying to understand what your strategy had been. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : We didn't, because we kept the discipline two years ago, three years ago, and because we're a prime competitor, we saw the industry \u2013 what my observation is the people that are in sub-prime business maybe had more loosening than more tightening. And so I think ours is relatively less. And it's just on the margin. Customers that had certain characteristics, we might tweak our models for who qualifies for a line increase, at the margin. We would adjust, who we're marketing to, where our cutoffs are for new accounts. And so there's been no major change. there's been tweaking of models for both the portfolio and for new accounts. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you and good evening. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Hi, Ken. Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. My first question relates to credit, and I'm sorry, I know this is kind of getting in deep, but you've mentioned that historically, you need an economic catalyst source to kind of lead to worsening credit. Our work would suggest that growth itself can actually kind of lead to worsening credit, just with the asset growth, and you're kind of seen that now. I would like to kind of get a sense as to how comfortable you are, that you're not going to wake up in two years from now, and you're not going to see materially worst credit than what you've got currently, and if you could kind of give us some thoughts around that, that would be very helpful. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Well, I'm not going to give two-year forward guidance, but I will react to some thoughts a little bit here. I guess, Ken, I like in the period we're in right now from what we're seeing most to a period we last saw in the mid-1990s. So you have a supply side credit driven phenomena as oppose to a macroeconomic or cyclical driven phenomena that's causing a normalization of losses. So the macro fundamentals all remain very strong, the labor market, HPI, BKs, all the rest of those factors continue to be very well behaved. But what you've seen is the cycle has persisted for longer, and as we have come off of loss rates that were just lower than we've ever seen, for longer than we've ever seen, I think you saw an increase of consumer credit come into the marketplace. And I think, as folks are going bad, what you're seeing is, with that increased leverage, particularly in personal loans and auto loans and few other categories, you're seeing fewer dollars available to cover that increased debt burden. So it really is, what I would call, a supply driven as opposed to a macroeconomic cyclical, say phenomenon. So that's why we're comfortable continuing to underwrite credit to the extent we are. Obviously, we have not suspended the fact that we compete in a cyclical industry, and at some point in time those macroeconomic factors will kick-in and affect everybody. I'm not going to speculate as to when that would be. We're not seeing evidence of that at this point in time though is what I'd say. Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No, I understand and I agree with your points. I guess, the fact is that, there is continuing to be an expansion of credit into the sector. I think, without putting too precise of a time on it, by the time that the industry figures it out, it's probably going to be too late, we're going to be whistling past the graveyard, so to speak, and we're going to wake up with much higher losses, and some of these books are not going to perform, the way that everybody had expected to. So I mean, the follow-up question is, what do you need to see to start to pull back more aggressively? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Let me try my hand at it too, Ken. I think so far the losses, the new vintages are performing per our expectations. And so as they started going beyond that, then we would start taking action. But to some degree, I have been in the industry when there was times when people, consumers and creditors overdo it, I don't think we're in that kind of time. I think that consumers and creditors were overly conservative a few years back, which is natural post crisis. And frankly, if you're in the prime credit card business, we never shopped for nor assumed that we were in a 2% charge off industry. In fact we would be leaving a lot of money on the table by shooting for that low, and the industry was at normally low. So what I'm seeing so far is a sort of return to what you would normally expect would sort of maximize the profitability, where you're not taking too much risk, but not way under doing it with risk as well. And to some degree this is the first normalization post CARD Act, post cycle. So there is some uncertainty as to that new normal. But I think, whether it's us or anyone else in the industry, people have been talking about 3% or 4% is being more normal, and it seems like we're just moving towards that. We're not even to that level yet. So what I'm seeing so far is normal. I'm just surprised it took this long frankly. Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Well, I think we were all kind of wondering where we're going to show up, and I've realized in being a little critical here, it's not meant to necessarily spec and guess your actions, it just feels like there's just been a big move, and every time we get essentially surprised by worsening in credit that the market reaction is a negative one. So we're just trying to kind of better understand it. Thank you very much for your comment. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Sure. Timothy Schmidt - Discover Financial Services : Thanks. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of (sic) Henry Coffey with Wedbush. Your line is open. Henry J. Coffey - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: That's an interesting one. It's Henry Coffey, and my good colleague hopefully will follow. So in very simple terms when we look at the reserve build that occurred in the quarter, and you look at the revised charge-off guidance, how much of a jump was there because of the revised charge-off guidance, or is that kind of higher reserve component going to work its way into earnings over the next several quarters? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So I guess, what I would say Henry is that, when we set those reserves, that basically it's an actuarial model that established the reserves. So it takes into account the development we expect to see over the coming 12 months period of time, and then it takes into account number of macroeconomic factors that come in from Moody's macro advisors, and any one of a number of different providers. I guess, the way I'd answer the question fundamentally is to underscore the fact that I take you back to my earlier comment that we've seen delinquency formation moderate, the point where it's on a sequential basis pretty much flat, slightly down across most of the product. So I think, what that should probably imply is that based on what we see right now, we wouldn't expect a reserve build of the same magnitude in the next quarter. But I would just point out that's going to obviously be impacted by any changes that we would see over the course of this coming quarter in terms of development. It would also be impacted by anything we would see in terms of changes to the macroeconomic forecast that we take in as part of that process as well. But, I think the development we've seen is reflected in the reserves we've established for the 12-month forward-looking period, and we feel that we are adequately reserved and reserved well in accordance with GAAP. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Henry, if I understood you, that you were asking, if it could get reversed, and I wouldn't be coming... Henry J. Coffey - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: No, no, no, I just wanted, are we going to see another up jump like that in the next couple of quarters as well. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Okay. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Again, it's impossible to fully predict, because it's dependent upon macroeconomic indicators that are forecast by other firms that we don't control. But the delinquency formation piece of it, all the parts and pieces we see right now would tell us there is a stabilization taking place. Henry J. Coffey - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: On an unrelated subject, student lending, you're number three. We're looking for signs of this, certainly, the wins seem to point to this. Somebody is gaining a lot of share on Wells Fargo. Where do you think you'll end up in the league tables by the end of the year? We're going into the growth reason, it seems like you're very much committed to this as a growth business. But what is the outlook, what are your thoughts going into the growth season, et cetera? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : We feel good about the season so far. We, looking at the numbers, I mean, Sallie Mae has by far the larger market share, we grew a bit faster than they did in the first half of this year. And so I would think that, I'm hopeful that we will pick up some market share from both of our key competitors, which is Sallie Mae and Wells Fargo. Henry J. Coffey - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Arren Cyganovich - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. Maybe on the deposit side, we have seen some of the high yield savings rates rise to 1.3%, 1.4% type levels, you're still well below that from what I can tell. What are you seeing in terms of inflows and outflows, and how much risk do you see from that going forward? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yes. So I would say, Arren, we see on the deposit side is, we don't intend to lead a price war by any stretch of the imagination. We went through a lengthy process over the course of the last four years, five years to really move ourselves down in the league table standings, and really focus on cross-selling to our existing customer base. So we're now at a point, where greater than 60% of our depositors have a relationship with us on the asset side of the balance sheet. Over 80% of last year's new depositors have a relationship with us on the asset side of the balance sheet. So we think our betas can be sustainably lower than what I would call a typical online bank that doesn't have that synergy between the right and the left hand sides of its balance sheet. What I would say is, we have noted the betas have come back into the mix. We're actually kind of surprised, they really took us along as they did to begin to creep back into the mix, but they're still well below where we expect them to be normalized, and well below the levels we bake into our margin guidance for the year as well. Arren Cyganovich - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. That's helpful. And I guess, from the standpoint that you had a moderate miss this quarter from the Street, that you're kind of saying that the Street is in the right ballpark for the full year. Is it mostly on expense lever that you can make that up, or I don't know, if you want to get any more granular on where the difference is there. But you have very strong revenue growth. I'm just wondering where the Street might be missing things from the second half of the year. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : We decided to be a little bit more pithy in our response than to go line item by line item in terms of the specific guidance. Again, Arren, I think I did say earlier, and I'd reiterate clearly the expense lever is one we will be pulling. They still will trend up in the back half of the year a little bit because of the seasonal spend, but not necessarily to the levels we had planned for by any stretch of the imagination either. So I think that's definitely one of those levers. There is other, there is volume levers, there is margin levers, there is all kinds of different other ones we can be pulling, but we chose just to again be pretty pithy and stick to just the number we thought really mattered which was that EPS line. Arren Cyganovich - D.A. Davidson & Co.: That's fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Arnold with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Good evening, guys. We talked about, I guess, the low, the loan seasoning and kind of growth in card contributing to the higher charge-off rates. But are there any other drivers of the severity elements in card that we haven't discussed, that you could kind of get into in a little bit more detail? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : One thing I would just say is that we have also been doing line increases over the last five years, eight years. And so cumulatively, we see a growth in average balance and so that naturally contributes as well. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : The other thing I would say there, Jason, that it's not really \u2013 if you think about it holistically, it's not necessarily what happens in card that drives losses in card, right? So it's really what's the consumer's overall debt burden, because we're not seeing \u2013 again, we're not seeing real increase in incidence rates to any meaningful degree. It's really just that consumers are levering, and we're seeing that leverage occur, in the federal student loan program, we're seeing it in auto loans, we're seeing in personal loans. Those will be the three categories that if you index back to pre-crisis, which show they've kind of driven the re-levering of the consumer. So if that consumer encounters an event, which typically tends to be an event because those incidence rates haven't moved and debt-to-income remains manageable, they simply are carrying a lot more leverage than they were, it doesn't really matter what product it occurred in. If they get over-levered they have a problem, all the creditors tend to feel a little bit of that pain. So I wouldn't specifically link card-to-card or personal loans to personal loans per se. Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Helpful color there. And then, second one I want to ask is just on the appeal of the balance transfer market, kind of what are you seeing competitively there, and kind of what's the appeal of that market right now. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So it remains a very attractive channel for us right now. We are utilizing it particularly on the portfolio side of the equation as opposed to the new account side of the equation to reengage consumers. I think, I in my sequential NIM walk earlier pointed out there was about 10 basis points of detrimental effect in NIM as a result of increased promo balances, and a good chunk of that was the balance transfer activity. I'd say they remain very high FICOs that, 730-ish average FICO on the card book is what you should still be thinking about us, the scope in which we are generally playing, and even higher than that for personal loans and for student loans. But BTs are a healthy channel right now. Jason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks very much guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Hey, Moshe. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey. So most of my questions have been asked and answered, some more than once, so trying to get on a different attack. Just thinking about the earnings guidance that you gave, certainly means that the reserve build moderates in the back half. And I know you don't want to give a forecast for 2018, but I guess, the question is, assuming that the macroeconomic factors that you kind of outlined are relatively stable, and the growth rate is kind of plus or minus where we are, are there any other reasons to assume that there would be a variation going into 2018 from where we were in the back half of 2017, whether the amount that you'd be building reserves? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : I don't think that's all been necessarily asked and answered. There is some new stuff in there. I guess, what I would say Moshe is that, it's going to depend on a number of different factors. It's going to depend obviously on the level of competitive \u2013 what competitors are willing to do from a credit perspective. It would obviously depend on macroeconomics. It would depend on any number of different things. It would depend on what we chose to do with our own underwritings. But I would say that, when we think about credit, your perspective on credit is decidedly dependent upon the temporal lens through which you are viewing it. If you think about charge-offs, we'll readily stipulate that they have been going up. There's no question about it. And if you think about it on a three quarter graph, it looks like a 45 degree angle sloping upward. But if you think about it on a 10-year graph, they fell from crazy levels to the lowest levels we've ever seen in a long time, and they've kind of hung in there. And they've just now started picking up really over the course, say of the last year or so. So I mean, from our perspective, it remains an extremely attractive time to be putting new loans in the books, because charge-offs, loss rates are well below what we would expect in normalized terms they would be. So I guess, that's a long winded way of setting up. We would expect some degree of normalization in the book will continue, just coming off of unsustainably low levels, principally driven by this supply side phenomena that we kind of referenced a couple of times here. But at the end of the day, it doesn't feel based on what we're seeing right now, like this is anything like resembling any kind of a runaway train. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : And the one thing I would add is, we're happy with our growth and continued growth will tend to drive continued reserving as well. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Right. And I wanted to come back to one comment that you made actually a couple of times about unsolicited borrowers performing a lot worse. Could you just talk about the incidence of that both in your personal loans and if there is any in the credit card, and how that might, how you might be managing that going forward? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Well, I'd say, I think we brought it up specifically on personal loans. Over half of our new accounts and balances come from cross-selling our existing, largely credit card customer base, and we're seeing a lot more stability there. In recent years, we have expanded into the broad market, and we've seen a lot, it's the lowest barriers to entry. It's relatively quite easy to enter the personal loans business, relative to student loans or credit cards or even deposits. And so we've seen a huge number of new players come in, huge growth in availability, and lot of these creditors, they don't have 10 years of data through the cycle. They talk about the great models, but you need experience and data to be strong. So there is an over capacity there which is going to tend to be in the non-solicited, it's going to tend to be in the broad market. And so I would cite the really explosion of new entrants in the broad market that are impacting credit, actually both for our unsolicited personal loans, but it's also impacting credit cards and other asset types because it affects those subset of customers. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thanks so much. Timothy Schmidt - Discover Financial Services : Thanks. I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. I'm wondering you made comments about tightening of underwriting. You've also talked about expense as a lever into the second half of the year. I'm wondering how we should think about that in terms of loan growth. Second quarter was essentially a fourth sequential quarter where loan growth on a year-over-year basis accelerated. Should we start to see that moderate given the other two factors? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Not necessarily, because you saw us achieve accelerated loan growth this quarter even with very modest expense growth. So we're achieving efficiencies, our cost per account are very strong. And so I would say, in personal loans, you'll see some, I would expect some desellers slowdown in the growth rate for the reasons I mentioned, we'll be going back somewhat in the unsolicited channel. But in credit cards, it's not that we've been spending more money that we can now cut back, it's that we've been getting better results, and we're pleased. And frankly, the lever of getting more revenue from good accounts is a bigger lever than cutting marketing expense. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. And I would also point out, you didn't ask the question, but I will volunteer one more thing to give you some added comfort on that, Rick, and that is, that these new accounts were coming in with much lower average lines too. So I think we're being very disciplined. So yes, the growth is very solid right now. But we're being very disciplined about the nature of that growth. And again, I'd point to our experience with the aggregator channel a number of years ago where we pulled back when the economics just didn't make sense. I'd point to our statement today about pulling back in the unsolicited channel and personal loans where it doesn't make sense. And if we start to see development in the card book that would warrant doing something, we'd certainly do it. But to David's point heretofore, what we're booking continues to be the kind of stuff that compound shareholder value over the long haul. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, Mark, that actually saves me my follow-ups and gives me a chance to ask one more, which is, I think the most misunderstood factor in the card industry right now might be the actual seasoning curves of loan losses. And I'm curious if you were to look and sort of index to a \u2013 at five years out, what the loss rate is, and let's call that 100. What in year two and year three losses would look like so that we can get a real sense of what that peak development, or how that peak development occurs? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : I'd have to give some time to think about that, want to get to your indexed graph, Rick. I guess what I'd say is, I'd remind everybody that in a prime card book, you tend to take peak losses about 24 months after you originate. I would remind everyone that the way you reserve for those losses, is you reserve on a 12-month forward-looking basis. So about six months to 12 months out, you started really seeing the reserve build associated with what you expect to be losing at the peak of that seasoning curve. And then you kind of fall off that 24-month peak, and somewhere between 36 months and 48 months out you kind of stabilize at, what I would call the portfolio loss rate, is really the way to think about the way the curve plays out. What I would say is, since the crisis, all those vintages are peaking at lower levels than what we've seen prior to the crisis at those peak levels, so they are peaking lower. They are inching a little bit higher every year, but still peaking well below what we would have seen in the typical pre-crisis vintages. So hopefully that's helpful for folks to think through it. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I appreciate that. Thank you, Mark. Timothy Schmidt - Discover Financial Services : Great. Well, that concludes today's call. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us. If you have any follow up questions, please call the Investor Relations department. Have a good night. Operator : This concludes today's call.

My name is Julie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Discover Financial Services Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].  Craig Streem, you may begin your conference. Craig Streem : Thank you, and welcome everybody to today\u2019s call. Moving on slide two of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs which are on our website and on file with the SEC. In the third quarter 2017 earnings materials, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial information, and we explain why these measures are useful to management and investors. And of course we urge you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Our call today will include remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer covering third quarter highlights and developments and then Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. After Mark completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, I\u2019d ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so we can accommodate as many participants as possible. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to David, who will begin on page three of the presentation. David Nelms : Thanks, Craig, and thanks to our listeners for joining today\u2019s call. For the third quarter, we delivered net income of $602 million on revenue growth of 10%. Earnings per share were $1.59, and a return on equity of 22%. I\u2019m particularly pleased with the strong growth, we achieved across all product lines. We drove total loan growth of 9% as we continue to focus on delivering profitable prime loan growth. In payment services, total volume grew 16%, our fastest growth in more than six years.  Looking specifically at card, loan growth was split about evenly between new accounts and growth of existing customers. While the third quarter of last year was highly competitive characterized unusually aggressive offers on new products from a number of competitors, this year some of the issuers has appeared to fall back a bit. However, our strategy and discipline remain unchanged. We continue to innovate and enhance our flagship product the Discover card and offer unique features like cash back match with allows new card members to earn double the cash back bonus in their first year and creates meaningful benefit for us to sustain customer engagement.  Our consistent approach and a slightly less than tense competitive environment have created more opportunity to drive both sales and receivables growth without a significant increase in marketing and expenses. Overtime, strong customer engagement drives lower voluntary attrition and enhanced growth. For Discover attrition has remain consistently low among prime revolvers reflecting the loyalty of our customer base. The foundation for our strong performance is our commitment to outstanding customer service and a unique and expanding feature set in our Discover card.  In our advertising, we remind customers that we treat you like you treat you. Customers are loyal to us in part because we serve them well which includes providing the helping hand in response to unexpected events. The Equifax data breach and the increased potential for personal identity theft it has created have been on the forefront of consumers\u2019 minds. The breach resulted in an increase in call volume from customers but highlighted that we have been on the right path and focusing on features and innovations that help consumers to monitor their credit. In July even before we became aware of the Equifax breach, we introduced a free alert service available to all Discover card members. Enrolled card members will receive an alert if we find their social security numbers on any of thousands of risky websites. We will also monitor their credit reports and notify them of any new account openings. This feature is the latest example of our ongoing investment to provide our card members with the simplicity and innovative features they expect from us. The number of enrollments in this feature has already surpassed our goal for the full year. Our new alert features is one element of our continued investment in technology. As a direct bank differentiation and technology is critically important for us. Our innovative features like Freeze It and our new alert service further differentiate Discover in a competitive marketplace. The appeal of these features was recognized by JD Power last quarter when our mobile app was ranked highest in customer satisfaction among all U.S. credit card companies. We continue to invest in new digital and mobile capabilities that enhance customer experience as well as advanced analytics and machine learning technologies that will provide a sustainable credit and operating efficiency benefits.  Turning to credit for a moment, while credit costs have risen, our performance remains largely in line with our expectations and our card portfolio loss rate remains below the industry average. The prime consumer remains healthy, buoyed by a robust labor market, rising home prices and manageable debt service levels. The Federal Reserve recently released its survey of consumer finances which serve medium debt to income and payment to income ratios at their lowest levels since the early 2000s. Moreover, the share of heavily indebted consumers those whose payment to income ratios above 40% fell to its lowest level since 2001. I would add that in October, consumer sentiment reached its highest level in well over a decade. The U.S. consumer continues to feel positive about future prospects for their personal finances and employment.  Given our commitment to growing prime receivables it makes great sense for us to continue to drive quality loan growth because the economic and competitive environment remains conducive to creating long-term shareholder value. Of course, we remain attentive to emerging credit data and in fact over the last year have reduced exposure by cutting back open lines in some segments of the card portfolio. Mark will talk more about it later, but one area where we\u2019re taking similar significant action is in personal loans, where we\u2019re scaling back the volume of origination sourced through broad market channels.  While the environment remains favorable for most, a number of our customers were unfortunately affected by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. For our 1.8 million customers in areas most impacted by the hurricane, we offer a range of proactive benefits such as suspensions of late fees and collection activities. Additionally, we and our customers provided support to these communities by donating $3 million to the American Red Cross.  In summary our differentiated approach and relentless focus on serving customers will continue to drive strong revenue and loan growth along with a robust return on equity. I\u2019ll now ask Mark to discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark? Mark Graf : Thanks David and good evening everyone. I\u2019ll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide four. Our 10% revenue growth in the third quarter was driven primarily by a combination of strong loan growth and margin expansion. The increase in provision is largely consistent with ongoing supply driven normalization in the consumer credit industry, as well as the seasoning of our last several years of loan growth. The only exception to this is contained in a limited portion of the personal loan book, that we alluded to last quarter.  Operating expenses rose 6% year-over-year as we continue to invest for growth. EPS was up $0.03 to a $1.59, including coincidently $28 million of income tax benefits in both the current and the prior year. And in terms of returns, it was once again a very strong quarter as evidenced by our return on equity of 22%.  Turning to slide five. Total loans increased 9% over the prior year driven by 9% growth in credit card receivables. Growth in standard merchandise revolving balances drove much of this increase, spurred by strong sales growth particularly among revolvers. Promotional balances contributed to growth as well.  We also achieved strong loan growth in our other primary lending products. Personal loans increased 18% from the prior year, thanks to active consumer engagement with our simplified application experience and expanded digital presence, this growth rate is down 4 percentage points from last quarter, as a result of our tightening of certain underwriting standards in our unsolicited channel and we expect that these changes will lead to a further deceleration in personal loan growth in the coming quarters. Private student loan balances rose 2% in aggregate, but our organic portfolio increased 11% year-over-year. As a result of expanded marketing efforts with a focus on digital contest, we are on track for another year of record originations in our student loan business in 2017.  Moving to the results from our payments network, on the right-hand side of slide five, you can see that proprietary volume rose 6% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in active Discover card accounts. In our Payment Services segment, PULSE volume grew at a faster rate during the third quarter with an increase of 17%. Diners Club volume rose 9% from the prior year on strength from newer franchises. And finally, Network Partners volume rose 15% driven largely by AribaPay [ph] volume. Moving to revenue on slide six. Net interest income increased $225 million or 12% from a year ago, driven by a combination of higher loan balances, market rates and our balance sheet positioning. Total non-interest income was down $1 million as higher discount and interchange revenue was more than offset by increased rewards expense resulting from greater customer engagement in the rotating 5% category we opted to feature this quarter.  I would remind you that we have previously said that you should expect an uptick in our rewards rate in the second half of this year and this result is completely consistent with our full year guidance of a 126 to 128 basis points. As shown on slide seven, our net interest margin rose 29 basis points from the prior year and 17 basis points sequentially ending the quarter at 10.28%. relative to the third quarter of 2016, higher prime rate and a lower proportion of student loans bolstered the margin offset in part by higher charge-offs and an increase in promotional balances.  Total loan yield increased 33 basis points from a year ago to 12.15%, driven by a 30-basis point increase in card yield, and a 43-basis point increase in private student loan yield. Prime rate increases partially offset by higher charge-offs and a shift portfolio mix towards promotional balances drove card yields higher. Higher short-term interest rates were the driver of the increase in student loan yields. On the liability side of the balance sheet, we once again generated robust growth in our consumer deposits. Average balances increased $3.4 billion or 10% year-over-year. Consumer deposit rates moved slightly higher during the third quarter, rising 8 basis points sequentially and 11 basis points year-over-year. We expect deposit betas will continue to rise gradually toward more normalized levels with any future rate rise. Turning to slide eight, operating expenses rose $53 million or 6% year-over-year. Employee compensation and benefits was higher driven primarily by higher headcount to support business growth and compliance activities, as well as higher average salaries. Professional fees were also higher as we invested in the technology initiatives that David spoke of earlier. I would point out that even as we made these investments in growth, our expense discipline and strong revenue growth produce positive operating leverage of 4% in the current period.  I\u2019ll now discuss credit results on slide nine. David highlighted for you the assistance we provided to customers in areas affected by the hurricane. While we provided relief to these customers by not aging their accounts, we did from an accounting point of view accelerate the recognition of $17 million of likely charge-offs in hurricane affected areas. That said, the ultimate impact on the hurricane maybe somewhat greater than this amount, primarily driven by the more recent and severe impact of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico.  Total net charge-offs rose 61 basis points from the prior year and fell 8 basis points sequentially. As we spoken about in the last several quarters supply driven credit normalization along with the seasoning of loan growth in the past few years have been the primary drivers of the year-over-year increase charge-offs.  Credit card net charge-offs rose 63 basis points year-over-year and fell 14 basis points from the prior quarter. Private student loan net charge-offs rose 44 basis points year-over-year and 29 basis points sequentially. The increase in student loan net charge-off rate is principally due to seasoning of a large vintage.  Personal loan net charge-offs increased 56 basis points in the prior year, and 1 basis point sequentially. As we indicated last quarter, we\u2019ve identify a sub-segment of the broad market personal loan book that\u2019s not performing in line with expectations and taken actions to curtail those originations. This quarter, you can see the impact in our reserve build. In future quarters, the personal loan net charge-off rate will rise as these loans flow through the charge-offs. We expect the future exposure of this sub-segment will not exceed $30 million over the remaining lives of the assets.  Of course, for the total personal loan portfolio, the net charge-off rate will also be impacted by the denominator effect associate with the pulling back on originations in the effective segment. 30-day delinquency rates were up sequentially across all of our primary lending products. Looking at total loan receivables, our 30-day delinquency rate increased 12 basis points sequentially and 26 basis points year-over-year. Looking at capital on slide 10, our common equity Tier 1 ratio declined 50 basis points sequentially as loan balances grew and we returned $667 million of capital to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases.  Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we may have an opportunity to refinance our existing preferred shares. It currently appears though this would be a beneficial trade. However, if executed it would be diluted in the fourth quarter to the tune of $0.05 to $0.06 per share. This dilution would result from two factors. First, we would have a period of overlapping dividend payments. And second, we would need to take a charge to retain the earnings for the capitalized fees incurred when we issued the existing preferred shares.  To sum up the quarter on slide 11. We generated 9% total loan growth with significant contributions from all three of our primary lending products. Our consumer deposit business posted equally strong growth at 10%, while deposit betas remained low. With respect to credit, while our charge upgrades have risen static conditions normalized in loan season, it remain below both historical norms and the industry average and we\u2019re continuing to execute on our capital plan with strong loan growth and the leading payout ratio helping to bring our capital ratio closer to target levels. Our commitment to disciplined profitable growth fueled strong operating performance with 10% revenue growth, NIM expansion and a healthy 22% return on equity. In addition, expenses remain well managed as evidenced by one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry.  That concludes our formal remarks. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to our operator Ruth, to open the line for Q&A. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is open. Sanjay Sakhrani : I was hoping Mark, you could give us a framework for future allowance builds and provisions and the charge off rate as we\u2019re go into 2018, because I know there is a lot going on with the growth inflection that you have seen over the last year and half. Thanks. Mark Graf : Yeah, I would say I\u2019m going to stay away from 2018 guidance at this point, Sanjay. I\u2019m going to make you wait until the January call where we talk about the year ahead. I guess what I would say is the provision build that we\u2019re experiencing at this point in time, if we take that small sub-segment of the personal loan book and set it aside, the provision builds we\u2019re seeing is completely consistent with the normalization of credit we\u2019re seeing from the standpoint of that supply side phenomenon we spoken about a number of times as well as the seasoning of the growth that we\u2019re seeing.  And as we have continued to find ways to drive very strong profitable growth in that prime segment, the 9% loan growth this quarter, it will drive increases in provision. I mean there is just a mathematical equation that takes place there. What I would tell you is any place we have seen the returns on that growth not meet our expectations we\u2019ve demonstrated the willingness to fill back on that. We did it in the aggregator channel in the card space a few years ago when the cost of acquisition got too high. And you have heard us talk about it in this broad market segment at the personal loan business where credit costs are running a little bit high quite honestly. So, I think the discipline is there such that we feel comfortable. While provision expense has been growing it\u2019s been growing for the right reasons as we\u2019re investing and building shareholder value for the long-term. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And my follow up on NIM. I guess what drove the sequential move higher on a year-over-year basis, if you got what I mean. And I was wondering if there was any hurricane impact in the revenue yields. Mark Graf : Yeah there hasn\u2019t been a significant amount of hurricane impact that we can identify in the revenue line at this point in time Sanjay. In terms of the walk of the margin from Q2 to Q3, it depends already because it\u2019s a bunch of things this time around. The biggest piece is market rates contributed about 7 basis points give or take. Credit contributed about 2 basis points, the receivables rate contributed about 2, the funding rate contributed about 2, and then the mix of receivables was about another 2 and funding mix was about another 2. So, if you add those all up, you get that 17 basis-point quarter-over-quarter increase in the margin. So, it feels again very strong. We\u2019re benefiting from that positioning of the balance sheet to be asset-sensitive. And then, I think we\u2019re also seeing just good prudent management of the funding of the assets and the nature of the assets that are coming on as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ryan Nash : I guess, just a different question on the reserve build this quarter. Can you maybe talk about how much of the reserve build was due to growth versus how much was from credit normalization? And I guess related to charge-offs, if you look at the breakdown of the 60 that you are up year-over-year, can you maybe contextualize how much of that is from the supply side seasoning versus maybe losses that you are seeing in the back book? Thanks. David Nelms : A lot in there, Ryan, I\u2019ll try and touch on it all and I will give you credit for one quick follow-up, just in case I miss any of it. I would say a couple of different things. First of all, the primary driver of the provisioning is the growth. That has been and continues to be the primary driver of the provisioning but then normalization factor is material. I don\u2019t want to downplay that too much, just to be clear. I would say, if you think about the nature of build, if you take glimpse at the supplement which you can see is about a $111 million of that build was specifically related to the card business. There was an outsized build in personal loans to tune of $34 million, $35 million this time around, reflecting that small book that we talked about a second ago and getting ahead and getting a provisioning for that out of the way. And then, I would say the student loans piece of the equation, you saw uptick in the charge-off rate this quarter. That\u2019s really related to that seasoning we talked about earlier, that higher vintage as well as we had a conversion that we went through on the student loan system on to our new platform, bringing [ph] the course to quarter end, probably weren\u2019t as diligent about working delinquencies for a couple of days in there too, probably drove a little bit of that delta is my guess. But, if you look at the reserve rate there, you can see it\u2019s up only 3 basis points. So, at the end of the day, I would say, it really continues to be where we are seeing the strongest growth with the exception of the DTL [ph] portfolio is where we are seeing the greatest provisioning. Ryan Nash : Got it. And maybe if I could just ask a quick question on personal. You saw loan growth on a year-over-year basis come in at about 400 basis points, yet it does look like the quarter-over-quarter growth did increase, maybe there was some seasonality in there. So, could you maybe just expand on your comments about pulling back and how do you expect growth rates to progress in that business? Thanks. David Nelms : Yes. I would expect you would see growth rates continue to slow further in that business, as a result of the actions we have taken and continue to take in that affected segment. The good news is, it\u2019s a very defined and identifiable piece of the book and it\u2019s not gigantic. So, I think from that standpoint, I am not overly concerned about it in any way. I would expect though you would see growth rates continue to decelerate in that regard. I don\u2019t think we are permanently abandoning the sub segments in question. I think we just need to figure out a way to go back to looking at them in a constructive fashion. And that will take us a little bit of time to look at models and do some further work. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good evening. Mark, we saw the year-over-year change in your delinquency rate to decelerate last month. Was there a hurricane benefit underlying that improvement or would we have seen an improvement anyway? Mark Graf : You would have seen a bit of a seasonal improvement any way. I would say\u2026 Bill Carcache : I\u2019m sorry. I mean, year-over-year. Sorry, sorry, Mark. I mean, year-over-year change\u2026 Mark Graf : Okay, got it. On a year-over-year change, yes, you would have seen benefit there is the honest answer, absent to hurricanes. I do think the rate of delinquency formation has slowed again with the exception of that small sub segment in the personal loans. Just to be clear, we\u2019re carving that one out here. But delinquency rate formation has definitely slowed. And absent the hurricane impact, which was relatively modest for us, you would have seen improvement. Bill Carcache : Okay. And as a follow-up, your reserve rate in card increased to 3.29% this quarter that now exceeds net charge-off rate of 2.87% -- or sorry, 2.8% by the greatest amount that we\u2019ve seen and allow. So, should we start to see the rate of increase in that reserve rate start to slow here, particularly driven that deceleration in DQ formations that we just talked about? Mark Graf : What I would say, Bill, is that the way I think about it, when I parse it up, is charge-offs are kind of looking what\u2019s already happened, reserves are really looking what we expect to happen. And while the rate of delinquency formation has slowed, the rate of growth has increased. The rate of growth in the absolutely underlying level off assets. So, if we\u2019re going to have a higher level of assets going through that seasoning process with seasoning being the greatest piece of the driver, part of that is what you\u2019re seeing there. So, you\u2019re seeing that increase to reflect that increased growth that we\u2019re seeing roll-on quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter. So, it\u2019s not the 9% this quarter just a driver, it\u2019s the stronger growth from a couple of quarters ago, as that comes up into the seasoning curve, that\u2019s really driving that. Operator : Your next question comes from Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Rick Shane : Mark, look, I understand not wanting to provide guidance on provision into 2018. But I\u2019d love to think about it a little bit more conceptually, which is, can you help us think about the lag between when loans are added and the loss curve and when you would be reserving for that. Given the steady loan growth throughout the year, that might help us think about how to model provision into 2018? Mark Graf : Yes. From a pure seasoning impact as opposed to that normalization element of it, Rick, I absolutely can. So, the way I think about it is, you think about a normal seasoning curve for a normal vintage or card loans, you typically tend to take peaks losses about 24 months after you originate that vintage, give or take. So, think about a bell curve that starts at zero losses, it increases to peak about 24 months out and then it drop offs on the back end of that to stabilize at the portfolio loss rate somewhere three years or shortly thereafter. It\u2019s kind of really the way to think about the way the card loan, the seasoning impact of the card loan would work. Student loans interestingly enough follow a very similar pattern; it\u2019s just that vintage curve doesn\u2019t kick in until the loan comes out of deferral. So, student graduates or drops out. You have a six months deferral period; that deferral period ends, that\u2019s when that basically that same curve would kick in with peak losses occurring 24 months thereafter. And if you think about it, it\u2019s logical, because the biggest losses are taken when a student comes out and is unemployed or underemployed. So, it\u2019s pretty logical process. Personal loans follow a similar curve, they tend to peak just a tad bit earlier, maybe kind of like 18 to 20 months out is really the way to think about them, but again, a very similar process. So, as you think about loan growth, it\u2019s really that area under that peak of the curve you\u2019re providing for. And every year since the crisis, our vintage of new credit has been larger than the one from the year that preceded it. So, while it\u2019s not mathematically correct, [indiscernible] in the crowd like me, what I would say is [ph] visualize it as the area under the peak of that curve is growing. You have a larger and larger and large vintage coming into replace it at 12 months to replace the one that\u2019s falling off at 36. Rick Shane : You\u2019ve done a nice job painting that picture. And just to refine us a little bit, because you\u2019re reserving 12-month in front of that, the reserve build actually starts around month 12. Mark Graf : That is -- it actually begins before month 12, but it kicks in, in earnest somewhere around month 8, 9, 10, somewhere in that range as you climb the peak of that curve. That\u2019s correct. So, if you really think about it just mathematically, the absolute peak is going to be somewhere between month, call 18 and month 30, right, is when you\u2019re going to have the bulk of the losses under the peak of that curve be recognized. Operator : Your next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. DonFandetti: David, you talked a little bit about this early in the remarks, but it stuck, investors continue to just ask why is Discover growing so much in their card portfolio at this point in the cycle? You clearly have a lot of excess capital and you see good returns as competitors have pulled back. Can you just drill down a little bit because sometimes I have a hard time answering that question? David Nelms : I would say, for one thing, the market is growing faster now than it was certainly two years ago, three years ago. And one year ago, it\u2019s probably when we saw the really absolute peak of competitive intensity, particularly around cash reward programs. And so, that impacted some of our response rates a year ago and it also impacted where we invested because some things were getting just too expensive. And that\u2019s actually our cost per account has dropped even with -- at the margin tighter credit this year than last year. So, our growth rate basically, it\u2019s almost as same store sales kind of thing a little bit, because last year it was when we were -- had really slowed growth. And so, we\u2019re looking back at that period. Competitors have pulled back. We\u2019ve been consistent, maybe a little bit more aggressive with some of our new features and so on. But it\u2019s appealing to consumers. So, there is no dramatic new product launch, but we had a lot of new feature launches and the combination. And it\u2019s not just new accounts. We had a little bit more attrition a year ago, given some of those over the top and often promotional offers, specifically targeting cash back bonus. Don Fandetti : Got it. That makes sense. And then, one of the large banks actually this quarter were saying how they were shifting acquisitions a little bit away from transactors more to revolvers. And it\u2019s hard to -- you see some plus and minus data points on competition. Do you still feel like competition is kind of peaked in your business or? David Nelms : Well, it\u2019s still the best thing going in banking. So, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as anything but robust competition. But, it was over the top a year ago. So, I think some of the craziness probably has passed. And we frankly couldn\u2019t really understand why everyone else seems to be going after transactors and paying up higher rewards than interchange. And if you have no interest income, you can\u2019t make that up on volume. I mean, it\u2019s by definition a money-losing preposition and I think a few competitors properly have noticed that. It is focusing on prime revolvers has been our strategy over a decade. So, we\u2019re continuing to pursue that consistent strategy. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Brendler with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Chris Brendler : Hi, thanks. Good evening. The NIM walk through was really helpful. I had my pencil ready, but I was hoping if you could, Mark, just comment briefly on how those will trend going forward directionally. I can imagine that they\u2019re all positive as we continue on. Obviously, market rates are going higher but can you talk about the funding rate and the loan mix and the funding mix? How does that look going forward, if you could give us directional help that would be great. Mark Graf : Sure. So, I think at the beginning of the year we gave NIM guidance on the full year to be, I think this is slightly higher and I think I defined that as probably 15 or so basis points. Full year last year was 9.99. I would tell you, I would expect our fourth quarter this year to have an increase in NIM but not by very much. So, you\u2019d have some further expansion but really more modest in nature, so maybe you close out the year at 20, 21, 22 basis points higher than that 9.99 on a full year basis reported last year. So, it would be the real way to think about it. We continue to be positioned in an asset sensitive fashion and plus or minus 2% is kind of what we target in this environment asset-sensitivity, and feel really good about the work that the treasury group has done to get the balance sheet position that way but also that the deposits business is done continuing to put up pretty strong growth in that channel, which is our least market rate sensitive channel. So, feel good about the trajectory at NIM. Chris Brendler : Okay. And then, a follow-up on personal loans. I may have missed it. Did you size the portion of the portfolio that you have decided you don\u2019t look at this point? And also, related, do you expect personal loans to continue to grow or it was just negative potentially? Mark Graf : So, I would say, we would expect personal loans to continue to grow. I would guess, as a result of pullback, you might see a slightly smaller vintage overall next year than you will see this year. But on balance, the affected portfolio is really small. We didn\u2019t size it but if I did, it would be low single digit percentage points. It\u2019s a very small portion of the book. It is principally behind us at this point in time in terms of the provisioning impact. I think what we said earlier in the prepared remarks is there is probably $30 million at economic risk over the remaining lives of those assets associated with them. Operator : Your next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead. John Hecht : Yes. Thanks very much. I guess following a little bit on sort of Rick Shane\u2019s questions about the nuances of credit. I guess, you guys are about the fourth quarter, you are entering the fourth quarter where you are starting to see accelerated growth. I\u2019m wondering, at this point in time, can you tell us, how you look at the loss content of the latest vintage, this year\u2019s vintage versus last year\u2019s vintage, say? And how you look at that both on a gross and net basis, because it looks like recoveries have come down a little bit as well? David Nelms : A lot in there, I\u2019ll try and answer simply and just kind of say, if you think about that vintage curve we spoke about earlier, in the card book that curve still peaking lower than we have seen it in a pre-crisis environment. But what I would say is, it is every year successively getting closer and closer and closer to that normalized vintage seasoning process. So that\u2019s the way I would think about it, the vintages are performing better than pre-crisis historic norms, but the gap to that pre-crisis historic norm continues to shrink every year. Kind of consistent if you think about what we said. We said that loss rates have been unsustainably low. We continue to see opportunities to put things on the books that season below normalized expectations. And as David alluded to earlier in his response to earlier question, I think that\u2019s the key to compounding value in a lend-centric model. We don\u2019t really charge fees, it\u2019s kind of inconsistent with our business model; that will be leg one of the stool. Margin is already pushing 10/30. So, I mean, I don\u2019t think, it\u2019s a lot more produced [ph] in margin probably. Expenses, we\u2019ve got the lowest efficiency ratio of any of the general purpose issuer. So, I think the third leg of the stool, expenses is in pretty shape. So that fourth leg of the stool is how you compound value with quality loan growth. And I think our pullback in DTL [ph] this year, our pull back in card growth a few years ago demonstrates that when we don\u2019t see the quality we need to have, we will pull back on that loan growth. But to the extent we can put quality on the books that makes sense that\u2019s good for shareholders, we believe it\u2019s the right thing to do in this environment. John Hecht : And second question, you guys talked about and we\u2019ve heard this quarter commentary through others that everybody is expecting deposit betas to move up. So, I\u2019m wondering, can you just talk about, the tenure of the duration. Where have you been focused on issuing deposits and how might that impact the overall betas especially next year? Mark Graf : Yes. So, I think we are particularly focused on the indeterminate maturities. We find those to be the stickiest of all of our deposit base. So, I think that\u2019s an area that we tend to pay an awful lot of essentially to. As we think about the retail CD product, I would say, we tend to move around a bit there and we tend to emphasize those products that are the greatest need and the funding profile, given upcoming maturities and other things we look at as we look to stagger out and stack the funding profile. And then, if you think about the brokered CD product, some of the suite products that we access as well, those really get aspiration. Most of those things we tend to focus well out of the curve, because they are one of our most cost effective solutions as rate issuer to getting duration in the funding profile. John Hecht : So, taking all that, is the duration now consistent with what it was, say, six months ago? Mark Graf : It\u2019s a little longer actually. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead. Chris Donat : Mark, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that balance transfers are one source of growth. I was wondering if you could -- I know, in the past you\u2019ve done this, you\u2019ve quantified the amount of your portfolio that is balance transfers. It looks to me like the amount of balance transfers might have been up by 20% year-on-year. But anyway, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how big they are in your loan mix? Mark Graf : No. I mean, I think when you look at the card book in general that\u2019s a pretty good guesstimate. It\u2019s somewhere right in that range, actually a hair below. We would have a 19 handle on it, would be the way to think about it. And they continue to be, as we look at them a very good way, not only to attract new customers but also to reengage legacy customers who\u2019ve chosen to deprioritize us in their senior wallet, get them back active again with the product. So, we\u2019ve got pretty disciplined process around the returns on that and they have continued to produce great returns for us. So, your guesstimate is pretty good. Chris Donat : I hope I qualify then as a [indiscernible], Mark. And then, wanted to ask something maybe a little forward-looking. And David, I don\u2019t know if you -- how much you\u2019ll opine on it. But with the Supreme Court deciding that they\u2019re going to rehear or hear the MX case against the -- brought by the Ohio Attorney General. Just how you think about your discount rate, if in environment where merchants would be allowed this year? I\u2019m imagining that you would not -- I think it\u2019s a phrased used before actually, steering pilots, that you might do something like that. But you\u2019re not going to jump in whole hog and you\u2019d only do something if the cut in discount fee would be more than offset obviously by a pick-up in volume. However should we think about what steering might mean for you strategically from your discount pricing perspective? David Nelms : I think that -- I think it\u2019s really premature to comment on this. It would be speculative. We\u2019ll see what happens. And if there are is an actual change, then I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have more comments after that. Chris Donat : Okay. I\u2019ll be patient then. David Nelms : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Couple of follow-ups here. One is just as we\u2019re thinking about reward cost, I know you mentioned second half of the year is little bit higher. I think that\u2019s a seasonal pattern, but we\u2019ve also seen a little bit of pullback in some of the competitive dynamics around rewards. Could you give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about your rewards offering, where you feel you are in your lifecycle of the current rewards that you have out there and give us a sense as to what you\u2019re thinking going forward? Mark Graf : I\u2019ll let David speak to the lifecycle comment, but I will I\u2019ll speak directly to the kind of what we\u2019re thinking, what we\u2019re seeing. So, the third quarter was a particularly attractive quarter in terms of 5% rotating category. Betsy, we chose to run restaurants in that quarter. Whenever throughout the year we choose to feature restaurants, we tend to see a very high level of engagement with that because it\u2019s pretty easy to max out in that category, spending $1,500 over the course of three months. So, that would be the driver of what you saw in that quarter. This quarter, what you\u2019ve got is principally Amazon is the big driver. We typically tend to do that as a fourth quarter promotion around the holiday season. It tends to also be more costly than what you would have seen really in the first half of the year. So, I would say, based on the level of engagement we\u2019re seeing right now, we\u2019ve been running these programs for a while; we\u2019re generally pretty good at getting our arms around where we think we\u2019re going come in. I am not losing any sleep whatsoever about coming in certainly in line with that 126 to 128 guidance. David Nelms : And Betsy, I would say that while there still will be some upward bias going forward as we continue to have a higher mix of Discover it customers versus discover more customers in the portfolio. We really kept our discipline a year ago. And so, what you are seeing is, if the competitive intensity slowed just a bit in this category, we stayed the course and we are seeing the benefit with the better marketing results and less attrition as some of the crazy stuff comes away. Our absolute -- my guess is, we\u2019re probably 50 basis points or more below a number of cash back competitors and in terms of cost. And so, I feel it\u2019s a very sustainable place to be and we\u2019re just happy that we\u2019re able to drive revenue and stay the course. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then, just separately, Mark, you mentioned about the potential to refi the press in 4Q. Could you just give us a sense as to what\u2019s going to drive your go, no-go decision? And then, what the benefit is to EPS? I know you outlined the healthy EPS in the fourth quarter but the forward ongoing benefit, if you could speak to that as well? Mark Graf : Yes. So, what would drive the go, no-go decision would obviously market conditions Betsy and just having an open window, where we didn\u2019t have something that would cause us to not be able to issue; some type of a corporate event or corporate news or something can also end up closing windows. I would say, at this point in time, I don\u2019t have in front of me the full run rate EPS impacts. What I would say just on a pure coupon basis, the last numbers I saw would show we benefit at least 100 basis points in the coupon. So, it\u2019s a pretty significant pickup in benefit. The first call date that we have available to us is December 1, on the existing pref. And so, we\u2019re studying it intensely, and obviously keep your eyes on a Bloomberg and if we end up doing something, you will see it there first. Operator : Your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. Could you talk a little bit about the kind of the tax drove the loan growth in the card business. I mean, has it primarily been existing customer? As you mentioned a couple of questions ago about the promotional rate piece, I mean how much of it is coming from new customers and kind of any other details you would be willing to provide? Mark Graf : I\u2019ll give you some pretty concrete data on that one, Moshe. I would say from my perspective couple of different things. This quarter, it\u2019s about 50-50 from new customers and from the legacy back book. We view that -- we like to keep that bouncing somewhere between, call it 30-70, 70-30; 50-50 sounds just about perfect, if you could always end up there. It tells me that the customer is -- the new customers are coming on board and seeing value and the offering, it also tells us that the legacy back book customer is choosing to continue engaging with the Discover product on top of the wallet fashion. So both of those are critically important because in the long run, our existing customers will die. Not to sound morose, but they will. So, you have to attract the new customers. By the same token, if you just have a revolving door trying to get new customers, because your legacy customers disengage, you have a problem. So, feel really good about the health there. I would say by far the way the biggest driver of the volume growth this time around for both categories was standard merchandise spend, Moshe. So, yes, promos are piece of it. We\u2019ve actually used promos a little bit more aggressively to stimulate the back book, but even there standard merch spend is a big piece. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Follow-up, I guess particularly since Discover is responsible for couple of the large personal loan portfolios that are out there in the industry, maybe just a little more detail about the -- what distinguish these customers that you kind of decide -- I know, it\u2019s a small -- single-digit percentage. But, where they at one end or the other of credit spectrum where they acquire in a particular channel? What brought them to your attention\u2026 Mark Graf : Yes. You got to be a little bit quiet on that notion for competitive reasons. We really don\u2019t want to say specifically it was exactly this? I think what we have said is, it was the broad market channel where we see these folks. It wasn\u2019t a cross market, a cross sold channel, so we highlight that. The other thing, I think, we have said not on the call today, but we mentioned it earlier in the quarter, so I would highlight that again, is I think, we said, one specific factor, we\u2019ve seen, it there was a tag of underperformances where somebody already had taken out another personal loan. So that was one characteristic [multiple speakers] would be one piece. Beyond that, I would give you comfort in saying, the size of the book here that\u2019s affected is pretty darn small. Again, I think, I said earlier it didn\u2019t size, but if we did, it would be low single digit percentages, the overall book. And we think we have the issues largely behind us and certainly we have it ring fenced. But for competitive reasons, I don\u2019t think we want to say exactly it was this and this and this. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Ken Bruce : My question first question relates to growth. I guess, there has been a lot of discussion around folks pulling back and the market becoming a little less competitively intense. You look around and at least most of the large issuers are still growing well above what the industry is. I\u2019m always little perplexes to exactly kind of where this growth is coming from. If it\u2019s the cut back has been, maybe the lower end of the prime and this is just really kind of the reengagement of revolving credit by prime borrowers, if there is any kind of change in the composition of what the market looks like today? David Nelms : No. It\u2019s a fairly, I mean the top six issuers represent a high percentage of the total business. So, I would say -- you average them together, you\u2019re going to get pretty close to the industry average. So, I\u2019d say, few people have slowed down their growth. But, where we\u2019ve seen the bigger change is probably how much marketing and what the marketing was. And frankly, I think there were some crazy offers out there that was leading to a year ago, a lot more shifting of people from one issuer to another. So, it was maybe a little bit of zero sum game where people were just paying more rewards and moving balances between them. And so, I think that if we look at the level of what the bidding for terms on the internet marketing are, it\u2019s come down this year versus the year ago, direct mail volumes, particularly in the cash back segment. And the sub-prime segment, which we\u2019re not in have had probably the two greatest reductions in new account offers. And then, you\u2019ve also seen some well publicized headlines and some people that have pulled back from some offers that I think they\u2019ve actually admitted were too rich. One of the things that happened a year ago is there was a lot of -- lot going on in the warehouse club space. And you had both Costco, the people that were losing that relationship were fighting hard; and the people who were gaining that relationship were fighting hard. Visa was accepted at Sam\u2019s Club for the first time. And that particularly impacted us, because at one point it wasn\u2019t exclusive. So, some of those headwinds have abated for us. And that probably helps. It\u2019s not that the market has slowed, actually the market has kind of kept up and that makes it easier for us to grow, but there is less shifting and our market is more effective relative to the others. Mark Graf : Yes, we actually tightened our credit criteria for cards at the end of last year. So, we\u2019re actually upgrading a tighter box down than we were last year. Ken Bruce : Right. That\u2019s -- we hear that basic tenet from others as well. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s a little curious as why everybody is growing faster today than it would appear the average is, but I understand David\u2019s point, there is a couple of high profile slow growers out there. My follow-up question I guess relate to little bit to -- as I follow up to the comment around the personal loan risk layering where you saw. You referenced something similar a couple of quarters ago on the credit card with late stage delinquencies, you\u2019ve seen higher levels of indebtedness. Can you maybe kind of step back and give us any sense as to whether you think there is parts of the consumer business whether your own or just can more broadly that you see this increase in leverage that\u2019s occurring? Mark Graf : I think the increase in leverage is really across the consumer spectrum broadly. I think it\u2019s most prominent in the sub-prime space where we don\u2019t really play. But if you think about it in the prime revolver space, it was a Fed study out there. I don\u2019t know exactly where to point to say number exactly when it was. But it basically took a look at coming out of the crisis indexing levels of consumer indebtedness to one, and then kind of showing by product what those levels are at today. And I think card was like at 1.06. I think autos, personal loans and federal student loans were the principal drivers of that increase in leverage. But I think it\u2019s a driver when we look at our portfolio across the board, our incidence rates that is the number of account -- expresses the number of accounts close to number of balances. Our incidence rates to delinquencies are darn near flat across the book. We really don\u2019t see meaningful movements there. What we\u2019re seeing is increases in severities because when a customer does go bad, they\u2019re more indebted and therefore higher losses. So, maybe the arithmetic way to think about it would be the probabilities of default really haven\u2019t changed much. The loss given the default has changed just as consumers are carrying more leverage. But, it\u2019s still below the levels that you would have seen pre-crisis. And meaningfully, the debt to income ratios, the consumers are in far better shape now, they don\u2019t have exploding arms that are going to be ticking time bombs. The levers they have built up is more largely a fixed rate product. So, it feels, while the leverage is there, it feels healthier. David Nelms : The thing I would add from industry perspective is a year ago, we were seeing very high growth rates in auto loans and that\u2019s really flattened out from last year to this year. We have been seeing several years of rapid growth on federal student loans and that has flattened out. Credit cards hadn\u2019t grown that much on loans, single digit levels, but credit card lines outstanding have been really and quite rapidly for a couple of years as people were chasing some of those transactors in particular. But this year, we have seen very flat, total cumulative credit card loans for the industry. And so, I think all of those things show that there was kind of a recovery after some releveraging, some recovery on both supply and demand for a couple of years and then this year it\u2019s really flattened out. Ken Bruce : Thank you for your comments. Mark Graf : Bruce, are we ready to wrap Operator : There are no further questions at this time. David Nelms : Hey, thanks everybody for your interest, your questions and of course, we are available for any follow up that you have. Thanks. Good night. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Mike and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 2017 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call.  All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.  I will now turn the call over to Craig Streem. You may begin your conference. Craig Streem : Mike, thank you very much. Welcome everybody to this afternoons call. I will begin on slide two of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com.  Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8-K report and in our 10-K and 10-Qs which are on our website and also on file with the SEC. In the fourth quarter 2017 earnings materials, we\u2019ve provided information that compares and reconciles the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial information, and of course we explain why these measures are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.  Our call today will include remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer covering fourth quarter highlights and developments and then Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. After Mark completes his comments, we will of course have time for a Q&A session and we\u2019d ask that during that time you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up, so we can accommodate as many participants as possible. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to David, who will begin his remarks on page three of the presentation. David Nelms : Thanks Craig, and thanks to our listeners for joining today\u2019s call. Before I get into my review of our full year 2017 results and accomplishments, I\u2019d like to comment on the recently enacted tax legislation. While the new law did have a negative impact on our fourth quarter results, which Mark will discuss later on, I am truly excited about the clear benefit to Discover\u2019s future earnings and the ability to make incremental investments in our business, our people and the community in which we do business. I also believe that the legislation will stimulate economic growth in 2018, which will tend to benefit consumers and Discover.  Now let\u2019s turn to slide three and get into our review of full year 2017 results and key accomplishments. In 2017 we delivered earnings per share of $5.42 and a return on equity of 19%, which included a number of one-time items primarily related to the passage of new tax legislation. Adjusting for these charges, EPS was $5.98 which was in-line with our expectations. Benefiting from the ongoing strength in the economy and more specifically on our own ability to deliver attractive products to our customers, we accelerated revenue growth in 2017, resulting from faster loan growth and a disciplined approach to credit.  Our card portfolio loss rates have risen, but remain well within our risk adjusted return parameters and the economic outlook for consumers\u2019 remains favorable. I\u2019ll talk more about loan growth and credit trends a bit later.  In payment services our PULSE, Diners Club and Network Partners businesses all drove increases in volume and revenue, while reducing operating expenses. I\u2019m pleased that volume for the segment was up 12% year-over-year which contributed to a healthy increase in profit before tax.  In PULSE, growth continued to come primarily from our core point of sale business and was driven by merchant and acquired routing decisions, as well as the addition of new issuers and incremental volume from existing issuers. In Diners, some of our newer franchises made meaningful contributions to growth in 2017.  Shifting to expenses, in 2017 we continued to make important and impactful investments in our people, marketing and technology to drive growth and new capabilities, resulting in a 5% increase in operating expenses. Our direct banking strategy produces an efficient operating model, resulting in a best in class efficiency ratio. In 2017 we grew revenue 4% faster than expenses, and our efficiency ratio was 38%. Finally we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, resulting in the payout ratio of 123% and bringing us closer to our capital targets.  Moving to slide four, total loans increased 9% in 2017 to $84 billion, with the card business generating more than 80% of this growth. We achieved these results by continuing to focus on prime revolvers and maintaining discipline and pricing, rewards and credit. Card loan growth continues to come from a balanced mix of new accounts and existing customers. The student loan business originated $1.6 billion in new loans in 2017, another record year, up 12% from the prior year. With faster growth than the other large student lenders, we believe we are now the second largest originator of private student loans in the country.  We continue to expand our presence in the student loan market, focusing on early awareness with the website collegecovered.com designed to help students and their families prepare for making decisions about college and how to pay for it.  Personal loans remain an important part of our product offering, generating strong returns while providing a helpful tool for customers looking to consolidate debt and manage their finances. As we have discussed the last several quarters, we have taken actions to curtail growth in some segments and we expect that the growth rate in personal loans will continue to slow. Our strategy will remained focused on originating profitable quality loans. We will not pursue growth simply for the sake of growth.  After several years of historically low net charge off rates, charge off rates rose in 2017 reaching 2.7% for the full year. One factor contributing to the higher levels was higher loss severities. The increasing supply of credit from lenders and greater demand for credit from consumers have contributed to rising debt levels and larger losses when a customer defaults. Consumer debt service burdens while rising are still near historic lows, while consumers are re-leveraging both creditors and borrowers are still generally behaving responsibly.  The other factor playing a role in rising net charge offs is the seasoning of growth. In fact each vantage since the crises has been larger than the preceding vintage for us, which while driving revenue growth also puts upwards pressures on net charge offs as each new vintage reaches peak losses. Of course our commitment to disciplined profitable growth in the prime revolver segment remains unchanged and we are quite comfortable with how those vintages are performing.  As we think about tax reform, it not only enhances our current profitability, but also affords us the opportunity to build incremental shareholder value by investing further in growth, our people and the community. The first investment we made was in our people. All non-executive full time employees, over 15,000 people, received a one time, $1000 bonus to recognize the critical role they play in deliver exceptional service to customers.  Further later this year, we will be increasing our starting hourly wage to $15.25 for all full time U.S. based employees. We expect our shareholders will benefit in the long term from these incremental portfolio growth initiatives and investments in our people. In summary, our consistent focus on the customer, strong momentum across our businesses and favorable economic conditions continue to drive strong revenue and loan growth and profitability.  I\u2019ll now ask Mark to discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark Graf : Thanks Dave and good evening everyone. I\u2019ll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide five. Earlier today we reported earnings per share of $0.99 for the quarter, including a number of one-time items primarily related to the passage of new tax legislation. Adjusted for these charges, EPS was $1.55 for the quarter and $5.98 for the full year. Our adjusted fourth quarter EPS was nearly 11% higher than last year\u2019s comparable period.  Looking at key elements to the income statement, our 11% revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by a combination of strong loan growth and margin expansion. The increase in provision is largely consistent with ongoing supply driven normalization in the consumer credit industry, as well the seasoning of our last several years of loan growth. Operating expenses rose 15% year-over-year driven by investments to support new growth and capabilities, as well as an unusually low level of expenses in the fourth quarter of last year. Turning to slide 6, total loans increased 9% over the prior year driven by 9% growth in credit card receivables. Growth in standard merchandise revolving balances drove much of this increase in card receivables, spurred by strong sales growth particularly among revolvers. Promotional balances also contributed to growth. We also achieved strong loan growth in our other primary lending products. Personal loans increased 14% from the prior year, down from the peak of 22% in the second quarter of 2017 as a result of the tightening of underwriting standards in certain segments that we talked about in for the last several quarters. We expect that personal loan growth will continue to slow in coming quarters as a result of these changes. Private student loan balances rose 2% in aggregate, but our organic portfolio increased 11% year-over-year with strong performance during 2017 peak season.  Moving to the results from our payments network, on the right-hand side of slide six, you can see that proprietary volume rose 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in active Discover card accounts. In our Payment Services segment, PULSE volume growth continued to increases with 19% higher volume compared to the prior year. Diners Club volume rose 14% from the prior year on strength from newer franchises. Moving to revenue on slide seven, net interest income increased $228 million or 12% from a year ago, driven by a combination of higher loan balances, market rates and our balance sheet positioning. Total non-interest income was up $28 million as a result of increased card sales volume and a slightly lower rewards rate this year resulting from changes to the rotating 5% category we opted to feature in the fourth quarter.  Discover card sales volume showed 9% growth this quarter, in part due to a greater number of processing days in 2017 when compared to 2016. If we adjust for the number of processing days, sales growth would have been closer to 6%. We expect to see the reverse impact in the first quarter of 2018. As shown on slide eight, our net interest margin rose 21 basis points from the prior year and was flat sequentially ending the quarter at 10.28%. Relative to the fourth quarter of last year of higher prime rate and a tighter credit spreads on refinanced long term debt drove margin higher, offset in parts by an increase in promotional balances and higher interest charge offs. Relative to the third quarter, the impact of higher loan yields and tighter credit spreads on new long term debt were offset by higher charge offs and deposit rates. Total loan yield increased 26 basis points from a year ago to 12.14% driven by a 17 basis points increase in card yield and a 63 basis point increase in private student loan yield. Prime rate increases, partially offset by a shift in portfolio mix towards promotional balances and higher charge offs drove card yields higher. Higher short term interest rates drove the increase in student loan yields.  On the liability side of the balance sheet, we once again generated robust growth in our consumer deposits. Average balances increased $3.4 billion or 10% year-over-year. Consumer deposit rates moved slightly higher during the third quarter, rising 7 basis points sequentially and 18 basis points year-over-year. We expect deposit betas will continue to rise gradually toward more normalized levels with any future rate hikes. Turning to slide nine, operating expenses rose $139 million from the prior year\u2019s unusually low level. Employee compensation and benefits was higher driven primarily by higher headcount to support business growth, the $16 million per tax cost of the one-time bonus granted to eligible employees David mentioned a moment ago, higher average salaries and adjustments to reflect changes in certain compensation policies.  Marketing expenses were higher as a result of higher acquisition costs and increased brand advertising. Professional fees were also higher as we continued to invest in digital and mobile capabilities, as well as advanced analytics and machine learning technologies.  I\u2019ll now discuss credit results on slide 10. Total net charge offs rose 54 basis points from the prior year and 22 basis points sequentially. For the full year, the total net charge off rate was 2.7%, which is the low end of guidance we provided in the second quarter call. As we\u2019ve talked about it for the last several quarters, supply driven credit normalization along with the seasoning of loan growth in the past few years have been the primary drivers of the year-over-year increase in charge offs. Credit card net charge-offs rose 56 basis points year-over-year and 23 basis points from the prior quarter. Private student loan net charge-offs rose 3 basis points year-over-year and fell 11 basis points sequentially. Personal loan net charge-offs increased 92 basis points from the prior year, and 43 basis points sequentially. As we indicated last quarter, we identified several segment of the broad market personal loan book that were not performing in line with expectations and took actions to curtail those originations. Last quarter, we told you that we expected up to $30 million in incremental exposures over the remaining lives of these loans and $10 million of this amount is reflected in the fourth quarter reserved build. In addition, you can see the impact begin to flow through the net charge off rate in the fourth quarter. The personal loan net charge off rate is also impacted by the denominator effect associated with pulling back on originations in the effected segments. 30-day delinquency rates were up sequentially across all of our primary lending products. Looking at total loan receivables, our 30-day delinquency rate increased 15 basis points sequentially and 23 basis points year-over-year. Looking at capital on slide 11, our Tier 1 common equity ratio declined 90 basis points sequentially as loan balances grew and we returned $657 million of capital to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases. To sum up the quarter on slide 12, we generated 9% total loan growth with a significant contribution from all three of our primary lending products. Our consumer deposit business posted equally strong growth of 10%, while deposit rates increased 18 basis points. With respect to credit, while our charge off rates have risen as credit conditions normalized in loan season, they remain below historical norms and well within our return targets and we are continuing to execute on our capital plan with strong loan growth and the leading payout ratio helping to bring our capital ratio closer to target levels.  Our commitment to disciplined profitable growth fueled strong operating performance with 11% revenue growth and a 2% increase in profit before tax despite ongoing credit normalization. In addition, expenses remain well managed though they were elevated this quarter due to the timing of investments in growth and technology.  I\u2019ll now move to 2018 guidance on slide 13. We\u2019ve established a loan growth target range of 7% to 9% based on opportunities that we see to continue driving disciplined profitable loan growth. As we\u2019ve discussed, the actions we\u2019ve taken will result in continued deceleration of growth in the personal loan business. So achieving our overall target will require relatively greater contributions from both card and student loans.  In order to support that level of loan growth, we expect operating expenses to be in a range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion next year. This reflects higher base levels of expenses to support growth in the business, as well as continuing investments in digital and mobile capabilities, advanced analytics and machine learning technologies.  Planned operating expenses for the year include the reinvestment of 20% to 30% of the year one savings from tax reform. Roughly three quarters of this amount will be reinvested in marketing and other initiatives to spur incremental growth with the remainder allocated to investments in our people and our communities.  We expect the rewards rate to come in between 128 and 130 basis points for 2018. We\u2019ve enhanced some of the 5% rotating categories this year and we are also making further improvements to the customer experience. In addition, as we originate all of our new accounts from the Discover It platform, the portfolio mix will continue to shift towards the Discover It product which has a slightly higher average rewards rate. Competition in the rewards space did seem to plateau last year; however, it remains to be seen how peers may choose to invest the benefits of tax reform. Moving to our outlook for net interest margin, we expect it to increase and be between 10.3% and 10.4% for the full year 2018. The prime rate increase from December of last year is not fully reflected in fourth quarter results due to timing and that alone should result in NIM expansion in 2018. Further rate increase would also result in NIM expansion due to the asset sensitive position that we built into the balance sheet and we are currently expecting a couple more based on the market implied forecast.  Somewhat offsetting the benefit provided by the rate environment will be higher deposit betas and modestly higher interest charge offs. We expect the total net charge off rate this year to be in a range of 3% to 3.25% as a result of continued supply driven credit normalization, as well as the seasoning of a growing portfolio. Let me reiterate that the overall consumer credit environment remains constructive.  Finally, we expect a significant drop in our effective tax rate as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act. In 2018 we expect that our effective tax rate will be approximately 24%. In conclusion, we are pleased with our performance in 2017 and are looking forward to continued momentum in 2018.  That concludes our formal remarks. So now I\u2019ll turn the call back to our operator Mike to open the line for Q&A. David Scharf : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Listen first one is, I want to \u2013 with the benefit of three more months having passed since last quarter\u2019s commentary and pulling back on the personal loan growth, obviously the outlook for card and student loan growth remains very robust in your guidance and I\u2019m just wondering, is there anything in the personal loan borrower profile you see that often serves as any kind of leading indicator of credit and other payment patterns for your other products? Mark Graf : Yes. We think a fair amount of what we are seeing in personable loans has to do with a lot more growth and supply. Many of the fin tax that are out there in the lending business are focused on this product in part because it\u2019s the easiest product to offer compared to a credit card or a student loan, much more easier operationally and so we think that in some cases there has been an over-supply of credit and we are reflecting that not only in our personal loan business, but also in our credit card business where we see the incidence of personal loans and maybe higher debt levels that may impact peoples performance across the board.  So it on average a more indebted consumer, because sometimes people get a consolidation loan from a competitor and then maybe not reduce their original balance, but they end up with a higher balance from the same income and we are not sure that FICO fully picks up this effect, because it\u2019s a fairly new phenomenon and FICO scores take a number of years to really even out with when there has been a big change in supply or demand of our type of loan product. David Nelms : So I might just tag on to that David, by noting that we do expect we will continue to grow the personal loan portfolio, albeit at a slower rate I think is what we were telegraphing in our commentary.  We\u2019ve said pretty consistently over a number of years that this is a product we are attempting global domination and it can be challenging and you have to be disciplined and I think at the end of the day the actions we\u2019ve taken reflect that discipline. They were insolated in a few segments, right. It wasn\u2019t the personal loan book more broadly. It really is a few segments where we are seeing this disconnect and I think it highlights we are managing it prudently. Mark Graf : And just one more comment. I would just point out that it\u2019s very profitable to us which is in contrast to some of the other players who are not making money even in a very attractive part of the cycle. So we are pleased overall, it\u2019s really just one segment as we mentioned of about 5% of the portfolio that we saw unacceptable performance and we took action on. David Scharf : Okay, that\u2019s helpful, and maybe just a quick follow-up on the rewards side. You highlighted that it still remains to be seen whether or not the plateauing we saw over the course of the last year whether that might reverse itself if some competitors decided to deploy some of the tax act saving towards the rewards wars again. I\u2019m just curious, do you feel like you may have built in a little bit of a cushion in the rewards rate guidance for this year or is that potentiality still something that\u2019s just an unknown and we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Mark Graf : Now there is no kind of a cushion built in there David. We try and give our best guidance at the time we give it and that reflects what we expect to be going on in the business this year as represented. David Scharf : Got it, thanks very much. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : The next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Mark, a question on provision expense for 2018. I appreciate the charge off rate guidance, but obviously a lot of the provision expenses this year is likely for next year\u2019s charge offs and some of the growth map impacts sort of kick in at that time. Could you just talk about how we should think about the adequacy of reserves as we move through the year as it relates to sort of your expectations? And then also just the range on the charge off rate, could you just talk about what gets you to the lower end versus the higher end? Is the expectation \u2013 is there a buffer built into this range? Mark Graf : There is a lot in there Sanjay, I\u2019ll try and touch on it all, if I miss anything come back at me. The first thing I would touch on is there a buffer in that range. I would say similar to the comment I just made to David on the rewards right now, I mean when we give guidance we try and give the best range of guidance we possibly can. So there is no buffer built in there that reflects in our best expectations of where we think the business will land as we move forward. I would point out that if you think about that, we saw 54, 55 basis points of increase in our charge off rate this year. If you take a look at the guidance we are giving right now, you\u2019d have to hit the very high end of that range to see a similar increase in charge offs in 2018. So I think there is an element of that that should probably reflect on how we think the business is likely to perform over the course of the year.  In terms of thinking about provisions, we don\u2019t provide guidance on provision, so I have to be really more circumspect around the answer to that one unfortunately. I guess what I would say Sanjay is I think about a couple of different things. First of all I would say, we manage credit very much with a through the cycle risk adjusted return focus. So it really governs who we target, the acquisition costs will extend, how much credit will extend, how we are going to price for the risk?  We could manage to an arbitrary charge off level, but that would probably leave a pretty significant amount of money on the table. So if we think about transitioning that in the provisioning, the way to think about it is the losses that are on the balance sheet today, that we expect to recognize over the coming 12 month period of time. So one piece we did give a little bit of guidance in my comments I can speak to, maybe help you think through it is we said specifically on that personal loan, the sub segments of the personal loan book. Last quarter we said we expected $30 million of incremental exposure associated with that, right. We took $10 million of that was reflected we said in our comments in the reserve rate this quarter, right. So that should imply to the listener that further $10 million of that $30 million of incremental exposure we expect to recognize over the course of the coming 12 months, right from where we sit today.  So that additional $20 million piece is still out there. So we are looking at loss content on the balance sheet. We are reserving for what we see coming at us in the coming 12 months and we feel in all respects our reserves are adequate in conformity with GAAP and we are very comfortable with their current levels. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. On the NIM, you guys are sitting here in the fourth quarter at the low end of your guidance range, and you mentioned that you are expecting a couple of rate hikes and you are asset sensitive. Could you just reconcile that with the NIM range you have given? Mark Graf : Sure so as we sit here right now, I would say the fourth quarter Sanjay doesn\u2019t really reflect the impact of the move in December, because you don\u2019t get the card accounts repricing until their next cycle date after that prime rate move. So you will really see the benefit of the December rate increase in the first quarter of this year.  The other thing I would say is we continue to be positioned to be asset sensitive, continue to expect that further rate increases will benefit us. The one thing that\u2019s a little bit different than at the time we gave guidance last year is this time last year deposit betas were exactly zero I believe or close to it. As we sit here today, I think on the savings product the cumulative beta now is at 36 \u2013 35, 36 something like that.  So deposit betas will chew into that a little bit. So I would expect you would probably see as a rubric, I think of about seven or eight basis points of margin expansion associated with every 25 basis point movement that we get from the fed.  Our other impact to that obviously is as we see slightly higher charge offs, we will see slightly higher charge offs of accrued interest as well. So that will also contribute to that muting effect getting us down to that seven or eight bps. Sanjay Sakhrani : Got it, thank you. A - Mark Graf : Absolutely. Operator : Your next question is from Bill Carcache from Nomura. Your line is open. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good evening. Mark I recall you using the term, you know bumping along near the bottom during those years, where you know the year-over-year change in delinquency rates was hovering near zero and would periodically bounce around. And I wonder if, when we look at the year-over-year change in the delinquency rates today, they are certainly not you know continuing to inflect up into the right. They are actually you know, they seem to be on a downward trajectory some months. They kind of may go up a little bit, but then kind of move up sideways. Could you comment on the overall trajectory of how should we be thinking? Is there kind of a downward bias to that year-over-year change as we look forward from here give the (a) the healthy macro environment that we are in (b) the fact that you serve prime customers and I guess all else equal? Mark Graf : Yeah, I guess Bill there is a lot embedded in there. Grab [ph] me if I miss any of it. I guess what I would say is, you know I pointed out a second ago in response to Sanjay that our guidance for charge offs, we\u2019d have to hit the very upper end of that range in order for us to match the increase we saw this year and obviously delinquencies are a [inaudible] sort of charge offs, right. So I think a reasonable person could come to a consumer that we do see a little bit of flatting in the trajectory there. I think you saw that reflected in our reserve bill this fourth quarter versus last fourth quarter right. The reserve bill was lower despite the seasonally high level of balances in the fourth quarter as growth in delinquencies moderated, right. So I think that is something that is reasonable now.  What I would say is you know that can change from time to time. So at the end of the day there\u2019s lots of factors. I always encourage people, you know really if you\u2019re looking for return in credit watch delinquency trends over a period of time. Don\u2019t just react to you know point estimates in delinquency trends. Watch macro economic trends through time, again not just reacting to point estimates and then always ask about incidents rates in the portfolio, right and if we think about a card product or student loan product you know our incidence rates are down a year flat, personal loans are also very flat if you pull out the segment, so that implies a degree of stability there. Bill Carcache : So given your comments Mark and the fact that we\u2019re growing off a larger base of reserve building in 2017, is it reasonable to expect that the reserve build in 2018 will be lower than \u201917 and you know all else equal that that trajectory should continue as we look forward from here? Mark Graf : We don\u2019t guide on provision Bill, so I got to disappoint you on that one with apologies. So I can\u2019t comment on this trajectory. I think put the pieces together and you can come up with your assessment, but I have to say sorry on that one. Bill Carcache : Okay, understood. Maybe on the last leaf I could with my follow up on how should we think about operating leverage and skill benefits? You know in the rising rate environment you know there\u2019s just a lot of questions on whether we can expect revenues to grow faster than expenses and perhaps see some downward pressure exerted on your efficiency ratio, perhaps to the point where we can see it fall below 38%. And can you just clarify like the rate hikes that you do have? You have the forward curve implicit in your NIM guidance, the rate I got looked its implicit in your NIM guidance. That\u2019s it, thanks. Mark Graf : Yeah, the rate hike outlook, there\u2019s three hikes, April, August, December in the forward curve that we\u2019re working off of and obviously December increase wouldn\u2019t really impact \u201918 if indeed it were to materialize. So that\u2019s why I mentioned earlier we kind of have a couple of more hikes in our cadence. As far as the operating leverage question is concerned you know, we\u2019ve seen you know a pretty meaningful improvement you know pushing on towards a 100 and some odd basis, over 100 and some odd basis points in our efficiency ratio year-over-year and we deliver 9%, or rather a 4% positive operating leverage this last year with 9% revenue growth and 5% expense growth. So we feel very good about the leverage embedded in the model and are happy to continue with the focus on managing expenses diligently and driving revenue growth in the current environment to the extent we see great credit opportunities to do so. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s great Mark. If I could just\u2026 Craig Streem : Bill, Bill, Bill, let\u2019s make sure everybody gets a chance and we can follow-up later on. Operator : Your next question is from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Good evening guys. I\u2019ll make it quick. David, I was wondering on tax reform, you know we had a competitor last night who was talking about how he thought he would be competed away very quickly. So you know I\u2019m interested in your view on what you think will happen competitively. Obviously you talked about taking the steps reinvesting 20% to 30% in the business and then related to that, unless you guys are going to go tighten underwriting I guess this can vary. It should open up the credit box or could this lead to better growth across the industry and then I have a follow-up. David Nelms : Well I think that having some faster growth in the industry would make sense, because at least the way we look at it, all of our marginal returns have just increased as we dropped that lower tax rate into our models and that means that you know that market in \u2013 those accounts that we just missed marketing to now are profitable, meet our hurdle rates to market too and I would think that other issuers would find the same and so I would expect that there\u2019d be some, you know some further growth above whatever it would have been, certainly that\u2019s the case for us. In terms of whether things would be competed away, I think that it\u2019s likely that some will be competed away. I personally think it would not be reasonable for it all to be competed away or for anything to happen very quickly. I mean this was a big change. It\u2019s not what I view as a temporary change. I mean if you look at our returns we\u2019ve been averaging 20% plus return on equity for a bunch of years and I think you know that\u2019s the top of the industry, but even the industry tends to have a better return than other parts of financial services and so if you just you know, if you were a theorist and said well, all excess profits get competed away, that would not be sustainable and it has been, because we\u2019re differentiated, we\u2019re a brand, there\u2019s a lot of reasons.  So I think we\u2019re just going to stay disciplined post card. You know there\u2019s one more discipline post card act. Some of these competitors need to drive higher returns to cover other parts of their business that aren\u2019t doing so well. So I think you know we feel like at least in the near term it\u2019s going to be \u2013 it\u2019s just a big opportunity for us. Ryan Nash : Got it and if I could have one follow-up. Mark, so you guys have done a great job in growing loans, which has led to significant pre-provisioning growth, but obviously substantially all of that has been eroded by higher provisions. Like you know you\u2019ve had your own version of growth mass. So you know from the outside looking at it, it\u2019s hard for us to see the profitability of these newer vintages. So do you expect that on the other side of this we will see an earnings acceleration once provisions begin to level off and what do we need to see for that to happen. Thanks. Mark Graf : Yeah, I mean I think at the end of the day Ryan, I\u2019d point to a couple of different things there. Number one I would say and we\u2019ve talked about this pretty consistently that we have a very defined rubric for how we will go after growth, right and our acceleration isn\u2019t so much that \u2013 well, it really isn\u2019t in any way that we have changed our model and what we\u2019re willing to do. It\u2019s really more a reaction to how intensely competitive the market has been and what others have been willing to do, right.  So you go back a few years ago, our growth rate was below the industry for prime card receivables at a period of time when folks were willing to pay acquisition cost through a number of channels that just wouldn\u2019t work on our model. So we had slower growth not because you know we decided to slow growth just because we weren\u2019t willing to chase what we didn\u2019t see as growth that was meeting our return hurdles. Today you see a lot of folks who pull back in that regard and so things that met our return hurdles would you know now meet those same return hurdles we had in place previously, are back to meeting them. So you know I think there\u2019s a discipline that underlies the way we approach these things and I think we prove them when we see things don\u2019t meet our profitability model, that\u2019s why we pull back. You know I would point to the student loans segments that we talked about earlier where credits are not meeting and as a result the return is not meeting and I would point to, you know that card space where we didn\u2019t chase acquisition costs where they didn\u2019t meet our return hurdles.  So I think we\u2019ve demonstrated in a couple of instances here the discipline we\u2019re applying in the way we grow and I think you got a sense for our acquisition strategy or decisioning strategy. We want the returns on those investments to exceed the return on the buyback program plus the risk premium and you know we\u2019re looking for them to break even inside of five years. So I think we\u2019ve got pretty strong criteria that governs that, that I think is pretty meaningful and should give you a high degree of comfort. David Nelms : And the one thing I would just add is that while you have a right to point out that provision has been a headwind over the last 12 months, the very strong revenue growth and our positive operating leverage has meant that the results we just reported in the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis have an 11% growth in EPS even during this normalization. So I think that\u2019s strong. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Mark Graf : Thanks Ryan. Operator : Your next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. Mark Graf : Hey Moshe. Moshe Orenbuch : How are you Mark? So maybe a quick follow-up on the reserving. Not trying to kind of pigeon hole you into a forecast, but if you were to just think about the improvement in the economy that you expect to come about as a result of these tax law changes and no other effects, how would you describe that effect on the reserve? Mark Graf : So I would say right now we have not factored in any expectations of improvement on the part of the consumer in our modeling and in the guidance we provided. I would say we\u2019re hard pressed to see that it could produce the major negative on the borrower, but we don\u2019t know quite how to figure out yet as we\u2019re still processing through things, whether there is real upside there. Moshe Orenbuch : Okay. And maybe you know, you started to discuss this question about other lenders kind of spending too much to acquire in your traditional you know favored space and then pulling back some and I guess, I mean what \u2013 as you put together that 7% to 9% growth forecast, you know what is it that you see about other lenders that gives you that confidence because you know it\u2019s a healthy forecast and its wonderful, especially given that you\u2019ve now been able to you know see the volume ramp you know to kind of be consistent with the growth of receivables. You know from the competitive standpoint, why haven\u2019t you know they made better in-roads and how do you get comfortable if that\u2019s going to continue? Mark Graf : Well, look I think we\u2019ve now had a full 12 months where we\u2019ve seen some of the craziest subside and you know the things that affected us in 2016 and caused us to go a little slower as we maintained our discipline, as some people backed off, 2017 we\u2019ve had consistently strong growth and we don\u2019t see anything in the recent trends and even the announcements on peoples first quarter calls, I\u2019m not hearing any restoration of huge upfront points or cash back or opening new accounts or what have you.  So I think we\u2019re going to have to keep watching through the year to see if anything restores, but my sense is that most of these players are a little focused on getting the profits up to more reasonable levels, because some of them are really low, are aways in their card business compared to us now and I think rewards is part of it. The other thing I\u2019d say is you know everyone is having somewhat higher charge offs and I don\u2019t see interchange rising from here. So I think there is sort of an upward bound you know where people need to both improve profitability and cover some rising credit costs. David Nelms : And Moshe, I\u2019d just stack onto that Moshe. At the end of the day if we\u2019re wrong and if competition does reemerge and start doing things that we don\u2019t think makes sense I would harken back to my comments a minute ago, we\u2019d go ahead and revise the guidance, miss the guidance and we\u2019re going to book quality loans that make sense for our shareholders. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Good job. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Bob Napoli : Thank you. Good afternoon. Just to be, I want to be clear on the reinvestment of the tax reduction. I mean that reinvestment of 20% to 30% is embedded within the guidance on page 13? Mark Graf : That is correct Bob. Bob Napoli : Okay, and so where \u2013 and that is in the primarily, that\u2019s an accommodation of rewards and operating expense? Mark Graf : That would be specifically operating expense that we\u2019re referencing in that piece of the guidance and I would say from that perspective, 75%, three quarters of that benefit roughly is going into specific investments in growth. The remaining 25% of that windfall is really going into what I would describe as investing in our employees. David alluded to the first piece which was really the first pieces which were the $1000 bonus that was actually last year, moved to the $15.25 an hour minimum wage that will be happening this year and then some other things that we are thinking about for our employees as well that we haven\u2019t really aired at this point in time yet, as well as some investments in some of our communities. So that\u2019s really to think through the way we\u2019re parsing it and we really do view those as investments in our employees, right. When you really have a customer service, customer centric business model that is so heavily focused on surprising and delighting the customer, part of the way you do that is by having who we think are the very best customer service contact personnel and paying to attract and retain those folks makes all the sense in the world to us. David Nelms : It\u2019s also in the growth lines where you know we\u2019re obviously expecting some more loan and revenue growth than we otherwise would have had, even though it\u2019s a little bit lower than the you know the very strong growth that we recently had that was far in excess of our original targets in \u201917. Bob Napoli : Thank you. And just my follow-up, your spend growth did pick up in your payments business and your proprietary businesses. Do you sense that is competition pulling back or do you sense that that is somewhat strengthening in the economy or just you know the marketing efforts of Discover. Mark Graf : I think it\u2019s a combination of things. I would caution you that I think about us having the same day sales increase of around 6% this year, this quarter versus the 9% that we posted just because of the number of days and that\u2019s going to flip around the other way in the first quarter of this year, so we don\u2019t want to call that out.  But we\u2019ve taken some specific efforts to get sales growth up to closer to loan growth. We also think that when we talk about competitors back in the Op book, you know some irrational rewards programs they were maybe depressing some of our sales growth before and that\u2019s less of a depression now as they are stealing fewer customers and we\u2019re getting more new customers coming into our program with more spend. On the network side, you know the big growth obviously was PULSE and you know there was one was large player that helped with the growth, but over half the growth came from a whole lot of our other customers and you know we\u2019re pleased that after several really tough years that the PULSE is back to some really nice growth. Bob Napoli : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Thanks very much for taking my questions guys. Mark, I guess we\u2019ve been talking about normalization for quite some time now and we\u2019re still below long term charge off averages but we\u2019re starting to get in the zone. I guess from your perspective is those 18 gear that were fully normalized or you know do we hit normalization in this cycle below long term averages or how do you just think about the trajectory of credit? Mark Graf : Yeah, I think just being intellectually honest, I don\u2019t think anybody knows where new normal is until we go through a cycle, because none of us have been here post card act to understand how the much more disciplined behavior across the industry is going to impact some of that. You know I think what we\u2019ve said in the past is that we clearly see losses this cycle being lower than what you would have seen in normal cycles because they were so low for so long and the industry has been very disciplined.  Clearly at this point in time I\u2019m not going to call, we\u2019re not going to call when we think the cycle will actually reach a normalized peak or a normalized point. What we do know is you know we are not underwriting to anything like the current loss rates we are seeing. We are underwriting to what we believe through the cycle loss rates embedded in that book, embedded in those accounts to be, so our originations, our underwriting, our credit decisioning has never been tied to where we are at a point in the cycle. So we\u2019re taking a long view and originating stuff that in our acquisition modeling drives very profitable long term returns in very different environments than we\u2019re in today. John Hecht : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then the second question is related to the growth guidance, the loan growth guidance. Forgive me if you have provided details, is there any change in the composition of whether it\u2019s aligned advances or new customers or maybe utilization rates or is that fairly consistent in terms of the composition of that this year versus last year. Mark Graf : The composition on the current side is about close to 50/50 on growth coming from new accounts as well as from the portfolio, which is in our minds very healthy because you want growth to come through your legacy customers. You don\u2019t want them to think they have disengaged. You also want to attract new accounts that exhibit the right behavior. So that feels really healthy to get a balanced mix.  The other thing I would say is with respect to the businesses overall, the one thing I didn\u2019t call out in case you missed it is I didn\u2019t say the growth rate in personal loans will decelerate. So a greater portion of the growth going forward will be picked up by card and student loans. John Hecht : Perfect. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question is from Rick Shane from JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Hey guys, most of my questions have been asked, but just wanted to revisit that growth composition a little bit. Mark you said private \u2013 excuse me, that the personal loan growth is going slow. The organic growth for the industry on private student lending is about 5%. So I am curious, do you think that you\u2019re going to go above that or is the confusion that really the bulk of the growth is going to come from the US card business. Mark Graf : I would say that you know the bulk of our growth is going to come from the hard business just because of size and I think that I would expect that in the last year as I mentioned we think we grew faster than the other large student loans business as competitors and moved into second place. I would expect that we would try to continue to grow somewhat faster than the industry in private student loans for this coming year, you know not triple the rate kind of thing, but faster as we did this year and card the same way.  As we mentioned personal loans, we think we\u2019re probably still going to grow, but it will just be at a much lower rate than we have in the last two years where we had much higher growth in that business than any of our other businesses. Rick Shane : Got it, okay. And what I am really trying to draw out is of the three businesses that\u2019s striking it\u2019s the only one that\u2019s actually going to be above that 7% to 9% growth rate for the US card. Mark Graf : Student loans could be as well. I mean if you take out the acquired loans, it was above that level as well. Our organic portfolio grew 11% this past year. Rick Shane : Got it, okay. Thank you very much guys. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. David Nelms : Hey Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good evening. Two questions; one on digitization. I think you mentioned that some of the investment spend that you\u2019d be doing is around digitization. I think your app is pretty well highly rated. So I am wondering what plans you have there? What you\u2019re looking to do with it? David Nelms : You know we\u2019re very pleased to have been recognized as the top app and top by customers and independent groups JD Power who looks at the digital capabilities of us versus competitors and we need to keep investing and enhancements making simpler ad functionality to consumers. You know just as an example I think Apple yesterday announced a new business messaging and we were one of only two financial institutions in that initial launch and so you know for having additional digital ways for our customers to communicate with us and manage their account and manage their security with the alerts that we put in this past year as an example. We\u2019re going to be heavily investing in all those. The other thing I would think about is that Mark mentioned some investments in areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence and so on and we\u2019re using those increasingly in our call centers to help with compliance, efficiency, effectiveness to aid our customers and so even the sort of traditional phone service is being impacted by digital, recognizing what people are saying and then queuing up a suggested script information and so on. So it\u2019s a fantastic trend for us and it was a big part this year of that positive operating leverage with revenues growing faster than expenses. Betsy Graseck : Okay, all right that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly on the dividend, could you give us a sense as your thinking, I know its CCAR period and you know we don\u2019t know what the rules and tests are going to be. So if you can help us understand how you\u2019re thinking about the payout ratios dividend, especially going into next year. Do you think that you\u2019d keep the dividend going in line with earnings growth until payout ratio is similar to what it is now or do you feel like you know given where the stocks have gone, there is more of an interrupt on the digi payout versus buyback? Mark Graf : So without being too specific because I don\u2019t want to guide on that topic, what I would say is we\u2019ve established a track record of increasing the dividends and I think you know we\u2019ve also said publicly our goal is to be an S&P dividend achiever and I think that takes 10 years of consistent movement of the dividend. So I think a reasonable person should be assuming we\u2019re thinking about adjusting that dividend as we look forward.  One of the really perverse things Betsy that no gift comes without a dark side I guess. If you think about tax reform, it actually has an unintended consequence in its interaction with CCAR. Specifically it\u2019s going to increase losses expressed in areas because you\u2019re going to have a larger after tax loss due to the lower tax rate and you\u2019re going to have a larger just allowed DCA as NOLs can only be carried forward now the tax law limited carry backs. So I think it\u2019s likely that the stress capital consumption for the industry goes up, unless the fed changes their instructions, particularly around the fed severely adverse which some people refer to as the brain dead scenario you known the 2018 instructions if they don\u2019t revise those I think there could be some impact.  You know we\u2019re encouraged by commentary coming out of the fed publicly that they are looking at this, so we\u2019re hopeful that there won\u2019t be a real negative impact coming from that, but you know it remains to be seen exactly what that will be.  The good news is repurchases for the first two quarters this year are governed by the existing CCAR filing that we did last year and don\u2019t see any reason we would need to make any change there. So again, none of this would mean we wouldn\u2019t be in a position to move the dividend, none of this would mean we wouldn\u2019t be in a position to return capital. It\u2019s just a perverse interaction that I thought you all needed to be aware of. Betsy Graseck : Yeah, no that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks. My questions was about the card reserve bill, you talked about that moderating. The reserve rate also declined specifically from the card business from 3.29% to 3.19%. So just want to better understand what drove that decline in the reserve rate is that the delinquency data that you are talking about, the monthly delinquency data coming in better than expected and just you know what drove that improvement in your view from third quarter to fourth quarter. Mark Graf : Yes so, just to remind everybody, just so everybody keeps in mind that we don\u2019t manage to reserve rate, it\u2019s a mathematical outcome of how we establish reserves, right. So we are basically reserving for the lost content we see embedded on the balance sheet in the 12 month forward period and then the reserve rate kind of falls out.  I think that said, you are on the right track. One of the big impact was what we saw happen with the rate of delinquency formation, the increase in the rate of delinquency formation and the trend variant. We also \u2013 the loss forecasting models look at 100 and some odd variables. I don\u2019t remember the specific number here. But there were a couple of others in addition to delinquencies that caused us to set the reserve where we set the reserve. But again as I said earlier, we feel very good about the level of the reserves. I think it adequately reflects the loss content imbedded in the portfolio today and we are encouraged by the trends in the rate of delinquency formation. Ashish Sabadra : That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then my question was going to be about growth. Just to follow up to earlier questions asked about the growth in the card business. Is there a way to think about how much of it comes from existing versus new customers? And when you think about capturing new customers, are you thinking about expanding your credit bucks just because of the stimulus that we are going to get from the tax reforms, so any thoughts there. Thank you? Mark Graf : So I would day the breakdown in the growth in the portfolio, its right now roughly 50/50 new accounts in the legacy portfolio which feels really healthy to us, so we are very pleased with that. In terms of any expansion to the credit marks, in relation to the tax reform, I think our perspective is you live with bad credit decisions for an awful long time. It\u2019s a lot easier if you return hurdles moves to say maybe I\u2019ll spend a couple shackles more for every account I bring in, or something like that, then it is to convince yourself that you can start opening up the credit box dramatically. So I would think incremental investing we would make, would be really more towards the advertising and acquisition cost side of the equation. Ashish Sabadra : Thank you, very helpful. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Chris Donat : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask one expenses, and see if I could pass out some of the movement on the income statement for 2018 with your guidance, because it seems like you will be having some higher compensation expenses related to the activities like the \u2013 I don\u2019t imaging some big number but for the minimum wage employees and then you got the investment in there. What are the sort of off sets there, anything you are expecting to reduce going forward or is just the numbers aren\u2019t that big on the investments of the $3.8 billion you had for 2017? Mark Graf : Yeah I would say I think you goal is to remain very disciplined in what I would call the core service delivery areas and I\u2019m thinking that really more the support functions within the company. And so that the incremental lift you are seeing is really outwardly focused on those folks who actually support the revenue growth in the call centers and the like with the minimum wage increase, as well as that increased marketing and advertising expense we talked about earlier.  So really the comp piece to our employees is something that let\u2019s just say wouldn\u2019t have a real big toggle level associated it. It may increase marketing spent and what we are willing to put towards brand advertising and acquisition costs. If you saw the environment turn on to you, those are the things you could pull back on pretty quickly. David Nelms : And I would just add, I think you are were kind of implying why aren\u2019t expenses up more if you got reinvestments in there as well and I would say that could conclude that are base plan involves some fairly aggressive expense manage net loss still grow in the revenues and so and one of the reasons things like the reinvestment with the employees to a higher minimum starting pay isn\u2019t bigger, is because we expect some real benefits from that as well.  Turnover is very expensive. We spent a lot of money on training and so on. The quality of the calls matters a lot to us and so we actually expect some paybacks in terms of attracting and repaying talent that can help support these revenues and that\u2019s why to some degree tax reform, passing on to employees is partly, because we need more, we need people to really help grow those revenues to achieve the higher returns over time from the additional investments we are making. So we think it\u2019s just\u2013 we do think of it as an investment not just kind of slicing out a piece of the pie. Christopher Donat : Got it. Thanks very much David. Operator : Your next question is from John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : Good evening. On the tax reform reinvestment of 20% to 30%, what is the timeframe of that? Do you think it will be 100% in the run rate by the end of this year or do you think it will some carry over into the next year? Mark Graf : No, I would expect that is actually dollars of spend we expect to see over the course of the year this year. John Pancari : Okay and then, is that any of that capitalized? Mark Graf : There might be a small portion of it, that is capitalized depending on some the choices we make, some decisions we make. But I would think for modeling purposes I just assume it\u2019s not and flow it through. And I\u2019d remind you again in the thought process because you brought up the notion of a run rate, a lot of these things are increased brand advertising, increased marketing spend, they aren\u2019t necessarily things that go into a run rate per say. They are things you look at and think about every year. So I wouldn\u2019t think about this is as a reset of the overall cost bases, other than maybe some that employee spend. John Pancari : Got it, and thanks Mark and then lastly on the loan growth outlook, the midpoint of the guidance implies a little bit of moderation off of the 2017 level. Is that entire moderation the personal loan growth slowing or is there some other factors that you are talking into consideration? Thanks. Mark Graf : I would say a second component is just the year-over-year period is a tougher comparison given our strong growth last year. And so I would say it\u2019s mostly those two things together. John Pancari : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Make or David, curious what your thoughts are on external growth, whether its portfolios or acquisition. I know you had the consent order. I think it was lifted a while ago, so maybe a little more flexibility. And then as you sort of look at the payments businesses, obviously it\u2019s changing very rapidly with digital. Do you feel like you need any assets out there or would it just be more of an opportunistic sort of move if were. I know in the past you\u2019ve expressed valuations have been pretty high. Mark Graf : Well, I think to take payments first, I think we see great opportunity in partnerships and I would say whether it\u2019s with suppliers, with other networks around the world, with some FinTech players, I would say we\u2019ve see a lot of opportunity to partner or have vendor relationships. Maybe some small investments over time and some of them could make sense, but probably less likely that we would know you \u2013 that it would make economic sense for us to start buying a bunch of stuff in that space.  On the banking side, you know we will continue to, we\u2019ve not been restricted from buying portfolios and even under the consent order and obviously we bought some student loan portfolios over time. We would continue to be opportunistic as consent orders come off. We would open up presumably more optionality. But I would just say that there is not a lot of direct banking stuff that\u2019s attractive out there and you know I think that the few direct banking things out there probably don\u2019t make money, which is usually a negative for us and most of what\u2019s out are traditional banks that are also in the direct banking space.  So I would say that we are, we\u2019ll keep looking at things, but we are primarily focused on organic growth and we\u2019ll be opportunistic on anything else, but it has fit financially and strategically. Don Fandetti : Thanks. The last question at this time is from Henry Coffey with Wedbush. Henry Coffey : Good afternoon everyone and it\u2019s a very interesting call. I just wanted to narrow in one area of really just personal interest. Student loans, when you say you moved to the number two sport, you means in terms of loan origination or loan balances and then as you think of. Mark Graf : Go ahead. Henry Coffey : Oh no I\u2019m sorry. And then as you think of growth opportunities you are very good in the direct in school businesses. Have you started looking \u2013 it\u2019s not as profitably from a yield point of view but have you started looking at the refinance side of the equation. Mark Graf : Well on \u2013 to answer the second question first. We\u2019ve done a little bit consolidation loans, but as you point out, the pricing seems really hard to make money at and so we\u2019ll \u2013 I think what you should expect from us is primarily to continue to focus on the in school channel. And the in school channel is very specialized, there is only a few players because you know you have to do special underwriting, there is co-signers involved, there is disbursement only though school. So its operationally pretty unique and so there is only a few of us that can do that and we do that very well and so we think that\u2019s where we can really help students actually pay for their education and get degrees and do it at the lowest APRs of any kind of unsecured loan out there. Your first question was? Henry Coffey : It was origination. Mark Graf : Yeah, so originations and I would say Sallie Mae is number one and we have now moved into the number two spot of originations and even versus Sallie our originations grew faster by a good margin than the originations did in the last year. So we are pleased with how that business is performing. Henry Coffey : Great, thank you very much. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to the presenters. David Nelms : Thanks Mike. A - Mark Graf : Thank you all very much. Have a great evening and of course for follow up you know how to reach us and we\u2019ll be available for you. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC Jill Shea - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Sarah, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2018 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem. Please go ahead, sir. Craig Streem - Discover Financial Services : Thank you, Sarah. Welcome, everybody, to our call this afternoon. I will begin on slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8-K report, and in our most recent 10-K, which is on the website and on file with the SEC. In the first quarter 2018 earnings materials, we've provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial information, and we explain why these measures are useful to management and investors. And we urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Our call today will include remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, covering first quarter highlights and developments; and Mark Graf, of course, our Chief Financial Officer, who will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. After Mark completes his comments, there will be ample time for question-and-answer session. And during the Q&A period, if you don't mind, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so we can accommodate as many participants as possible. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to David, who'll begin his remarks on page 3 of the presentation. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, Craig, and thanks to all of you for joining the call today. In the first quarter, we delivered net income of $666 million with earnings per share of $1.82 and the return on equity of 25%. Very solid performance, which reflects our success in driving outstanding growth in receivables, pre-provisioned net revenue and shareholder returns. Our strong profitability is the result of consistent execution of our Direct Banking strategy, buoyed by positive macroeconomic conditions. The environment for prime consumers remains healthy, supported by a robust labor market and rising home prices, both important indicators of credit performance on our target segment. In addition, data suggests that U.S. consumers generally continue to feel positive about future prospects for their personal finances. We believe our positive business momentum will continue to be supported by the growing economy and higher take-home pay as a result of tax reform. Credit performance across the industry continues to normalize after several years of historically very low net charge-off rates, including in our portfolio. This trend has been driven by the increase in supply of credit from lenders and greater usage of credit by consumers. Against the backdrop of low unemployment, rising wages and lower consumer tax burdens, we view recent credit performance as the natural result of this greater availability of consumer credit and not as the first sign of a downturn. The other factor playing a role in higher provisions is the seasoning of our loan growth, as recent vintages make up a larger percentage of our portfolio. These vintages are performing in line with our expectations, and we will continue to pursue quality loan growth because the economic and competitive environment remains conducive to creating long-term shareholder value. Receivables grew 9% in the first quarter led by strong growth in the card business. Card loan growth continues to come from a balanced mix of new accounts and existing customers, and is supported by sales growth acceleration. The origin of sales growth includes strong customer acquisition, low attrition and economic growth. It is clear that the Discover brand as well as the features and benefits of our card continue to resonate with consumers, driving growth in new account acquisitions. Our consistent focus on prime revolvers and discipline in pricing and rewards drove 10% revenue growth in the first quarter. Operating expenses also rose as we continued to invest both for growth and an enhanced customer experience, as well as to advance our analytical capabilities. Our efficient operating model helped keep expense growth lower than revenue growth, driving positive operating leverage again this quarter. In Payment Services, our PULSE, Diners Club and Network Partners businesses, each delivered double-digit increases in volume. I'm pleased that volume for the segment was up 19% year-over-year, which drove a healthy increase in revenue while prudent expense management held operating expenses flat. Before I turn over the call to Mark, I want to take a minute to highlight an initiative that we believe is an important element in our long-term strategy. In February, we announced our new debit rewards program for our Cashback Checking product. This program allows our checking customers to earn 1% cashback and up to $3,000 of eligible debit card purchases each month. Despite only minimal promotion to-date, the checking product has received a positive reception in the market, particularly among millennials with an average age of 35 for new checking account customers in the first quarter. Importantly, for more than 40% of the new checking accounts opened in the first quarter, this represents the customers' first relationship with Discover. This demonstrates the checking product's potential to serve as an important new entry point to the Discover franchise. In summary, our consistent focus on the customer, good momentum across our businesses and favorable economic conditions continue to drive strong risk-adjusted returns. Now I'll ask Mark to discuss our financial results in more detail. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide 4. Looking at key elements of the income statement, our 10% revenue growth in the first quarter was driven primarily by a combination of strong loan growth and margin expansion. The increase in provision is largely consistent with ongoing supply-driven normalization in the consumer credit industry as well as the seasoning of our last several years of loan growth. Operating expenses rose 9% year-over-year as a result of investments to support growth and new capabilities. Turning to slide 5. Total loans increased 9% over the prior year, the result of a 10% growth in credit card receivables. Growth in standard merchandise revolving balances drove much of this increase, spurred by stronger sales growth from both revolvers and transactors. Promotional balances were a more modest contributor to our strong performance. Looking forward, we believe that the first quarter will represent the high watermark for receivables growth. This is due to a combination of tougher comparisons, the continued slowdown in personal loan originations and our expectation for lower balance transfer activity in card. Looking at our other primary lending products, year-over-year growth in personal loans slowed to 10%. Private student loan balances rose 3% in aggregate, but our organic portfolio increased 11% year-over-year. Moving to the results from our payments network, on the right-hand side of slide 5, you can see the proprietary volume rose 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in active Discover card accounts. In our Payment Services segment, PULSE volume growth continued to increase, with 20% higher volume compared to the prior year as a result of merchant and acquirer routing decisions as well as incremental volume from existing issuers. Diners Club volume rose 14% from the prior year on strength from newer franchises and Network Partners volume increased 24%, driven by AribaPay volume. Moving to revenue on slide 6. Net interest income increased $208 million or 11% from a year ago, driven by a combination of higher loan balances, market rates and our balance sheet positioning. Total non-interest income was up $28 million, driven by Discover card sales volume, which grew 6% this quarter, despite a smaller number of processing days when compared to 2017. If we adjust for the number of processing days, sales growth would be closer to 8%. As shown on slide 7, our net interest margin rose 16 basis points from the prior year and was down 5 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at 10.23%. Relative to the first quarter of last year, the net benefit of a higher prime rate and a favorable shift in funding mix were partially offset by an increase in promotional balances and higher interest charge-offs. Relative to the fourth quarter, the net benefit of a higher prime rate was more than offset by higher interest charge-offs, as well as some minor shifts in portfolio and funding mix. Total loan yield increased 27 basis points from a year ago to 12.21%, resulting from a 20-basis-point increase in card yield and a 60-basis-point increase in private student loan yield. Prime rate increases, partially offset by the impact of somewhat larger promotional balances and higher charge-offs, drove card yields higher. Higher short-term interest rates drove the increase in student loan yields. On the liability side of the balance sheet, we once again generated robust growth in our consumer deposits, which ended the quarter above $40 billion. Consumer deposit rates rose during the first quarter, increasing 15 basis points sequentially and 34 basis points year-over-year. As one would expect, as we get further into a rising rate cycle, deposit betas are rising, and we expect that trend will continue in 2018. Turning to slide 8, operating expenses rose $83 million from the prior year. Employee compensation and benefits was higher, the result of increased head count to support business growth and higher average salaries. Marketing expenses were up as a result of higher account acquisition costs and increased brand advertising. Other expenses also grew as we increased our philanthropic commitments. I'll now discuss credit results on slide 9. Total net charge-offs rose 49 basis points from the prior year and 24 basis points sequentially. As we've talked about over the last year, supply-driven credit normalization, along with the seasoning of loan growth in the past few years, have been the primary drivers of the year-over-year increase in charge-offs. Credit card net charge-offs rose 48 basis points year-over-year, with this quarter representing the second consecutive quarter of slowing year-over-year increases in card charge-offs. I'm also pleased to say that for the month of April, we've seen improving credit performance showing up both in payment rate as well as delinquency formation. Personal loan net charge-offs increased 87 basis points from the prior year and 41 basis points sequentially. As we indicated last year, we stopped booking loans in several segments of the broad market personal loan book that were not performing in line with our expectations. Losses on these segments continue to rise as the loans season, but the performance of the rest of the portfolio is consistent with our expectations. Remaining incremental exposure over the lives of the loans in the discontinued segments is expected to be approximately $20 million. Private student loan net charge-offs rose 32 basis points year-over-year and fell 11 basis points sequentially. Total company 30-plus-day delinquency rates were largely flat sequentially and up 26 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This increase is fairly consistent across credit cards, student loans and personal loans, and is similar to what we saw in the second half of 2017. As with net charge-offs, increasing delinquencies are driven by normalization and seasoning. Looking at capital on slide 10, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 30 basis points sequentially as loan balances declined. Our payout ratio for the last 12 months was 120%. Before I move on, I want to say a few words about capital stress testing. As you remember, last month, the Federal Reserve announced that it was introducing a new model that would likely increase stress losses on credit card receivables. In addition, this year's CCAR process incorporates both a more severe stress scenario as well as the impact of tax reform on stress capital consumption. These factors were taken into account in our recent capital plan submission, and while we can't provide specifics prior to receiving regulatory feedback, realistically speaking, we expect the payout for the next CCAR cycle to be somewhat below 100%. To sum up the quarter on slide 11, we generated 9% total loan growth and an overall 25% return on equity, with significant contributions from all three of our primary lending products. Our consumer deposit business posted equally strong growth of 10%, while deposit rates increased 34 basis points year-over-year. With respect to credit, while our charge-off rates have risen as credit conditions normalize and loans season, they remain consistent with our expectations as well as our return targets. And we are continuing to execute on our capital plan, with strong loan growth and a leading payout ratio helping to bring our capital ratio closer to target levels. In conclusion, we're pleased with our performance this quarter and are confident in our outlook for the balance of the year. That concludes our formal remarks. So now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Sarah, to open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Thank you. And your first question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Sanjay, are you there? Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. I'm sorry about that, I was on mute. Thanks. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : No worries. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: First question is around credit quality. Thanks for all the color. Mark, intra-quarter, you talked about the provision being a little bit higher than the consensus estimate for the first quarter. As you look out for the remainder of the year and considering some of the comments you had on the April statistics, I mean, do you think the provisions are appropriate across the Street? And then maybe just specific to the April numbers, relative to the guidance that you've given for the year in terms of the charge-off rate, does that favorably influence that range? Thanks. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Absolutely. So, Sanjay, I would say with respect to provision, we don't typically guide provision. The only reason we made those comments at your conference actually back in January was we saw folks coming in a little bit high. I guess what I would say is if we saw a need as models come out for the next quarter to adjust provision guidance, we'll give a soft nudge then at that point in time. But, right now, I guess what I would say is we feel very good about that 2018 charge-off guidance that we did give at the beginning of the year of 3% to 3.25%, and all the performance continues to be in line with those expectations. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And I guess on CCAR as a follow-up, the little under 100% that you mentioned, do you feel like that fully contemplates the spirit of what the Fed is suggesting across all the data points we have on what they've said about the new models? Or is there some variability to what that might end up being after the process and what you might be able to do there? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : I think it's fair to say there clearly could be some variability. We don't have insight into exactly what the Fed's new model shows. I think that letter, you guys all had a chance to see it, it was a public record document. It just said it's going to produce materially higher losses. We have no way to calibrate, Sanjay, whether materially higher is 10% higher or 30% higher, right? So I think we took a very thoughtful approach to how we worked our way through it, and my comments today reflect the spirit of our submission. How it actually works its way through the Fed, we'll have to wait and see. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks. Mark, you had kind of pointed out that you thought that the first quarter would be the best quarter for growth and outlined some of the reasons. Maybe if you flip that around and talk a little bit about the competitive environment, what other things might be going on and how you think about that and also your use of promo rates in that and how you're kind of thinking about that for the balance of the year? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. So, this is David. Maybe I'll kick off and Mark maybe want to add something. I think if you look over the last couple of years, two years ago, our growth slowed a bit more because there were some competitors who were really aggressive and we saw some maybe fewer profitable opportunities. We talked last year about the fact that some of those competitors pulled back, and that allowed us to put up accelerated growth. This year, I'm seeing that it's starting off feeling a lot like last year in terms of the competitive environment. Competitive but not overly-competitive, not crazy, not as many crazy offers out there. But we're now looking back over a comparable period where we had high growth. So I think if you look at the guidance we gave for the year of 7% to 9%, this quarter, we were actually a little bit above that. So I think, consistent with that guidance, we expect that as we continue to see great opportunities to grow value and profitability, that's allowing us to put on really good growth. But the year-over-year change, we would expect to fall somewhat, but at least maybe into the range of the 7% to 9% that we guided. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. Moshe, what I'd tack on to that would be a couple of things. And I guess, number one, really underscore David's earlier point about our approach to growth really hasn't changed over the last number of years. It's really just competitors surging and then pulling back and other things that have impacted the rate of growth because we stayed consistent in the return thresholds we look for and what we'll actually book. So it's a pullback of others that has allowed our growth rates to rebound a little bit. But I think the tougher comps that I referenced earlier to, our growth rate really accelerated as a result of that pullback through 2017. I think also the pullback in the DPL originations that we have talked about a few different times will have a meaningful impact on that overall loan growth as well. So I wouldn't expect \u2013 we're not calling out that we expect loan growth to fall dramatically. I think we're just kind of saying, what's on the margin, it's probably going to be somewhat lower as we look forward than what we're looking at right now. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got you. And maybe to kind of relate that to the fact that you had positive operating leverage with 9% expense growth, which is a pretty good feat. How do you think about expense growth in that context for the balance of the year? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. I mean, I think at the end of the day, expense growth, Moshe, is really a function of business growth. And it's naturally going to fluctuate as we invest in the business and look for ways to capitalize on great growth opportunities as we see them. And we've talked in the past, there's tremendous leverage in the model in marketing costs and absolute levels of marketing, a lots of different levers that when you hit an environment where really shifting to focus on pulling back on expenses as opposed to building a franchise makes sense, we feel very comfortable in our ability to do that. So I think it's a conscious decision, long story short, that got us to the 9% growth. And I wouldn't think about all that as impressed run rate kind of numbers. It's conscious decision-making quarter-over-quarter. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thanks very much. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Donald J. Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good evening, Mark. So the NIM was down a little bit Q-over-Q. I assume that the full-year 2018 guidance still holds. I think it was 10.3% to 10.4%. And then can you talk a little bit about the card yield progression? It sounds like credit was a factor on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but would you expect to see that sort of pop a little bit more? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. In terms of the full-year guide, Don, I would say if we kind of saw a need to revise that guidance, we'd revise the guidance. So I wouldn't worry about that one. I would say, in terms of quarter on a sequential basis, I would say what we said is expect about 7 to 8 basis points of upside from every 25 basis points that hike. And based on our asset-sensitive positioning, I would say that is consistent with what we saw this quarter. I think sometimes you will forget there's a seasonal uptick in charge-offs in the first quarter. So, that really kind of increases your revenue suppression. We also saw a little bit of an increase in promotional balance mix this quarter. And I think you heard me say in our prepared remarks, we're going to see a little less promotional growth in the mix going forward. So I think those two things really combined to offset the goodness that we saw on the rate side. Feel good about our continued positioning. Think again about the comments we made in what we're seeing around credit in the month of April. So, again, if we saw a need to revise that NIM guidance, we would have revised it. Donald J. Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And just a clarification. I know CCAR doesn't incorporate CECL, but are you sort of thinking about that as you set your payout ratio or your capital level today? And do you have any initial thoughts? I mean, obviously, there'll be some impact to the card lenders. Do you have any sort of commentary on how we should be thinking about that at this point? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. No, I mean, it's preliminary. We're working our own way through it at this point in time, Don. I guess what we have said is, make no mistake, reserves will go up in a seasonal environment, given our product and our business mix, right? So I think that's definitely the case. I think the thing I'd remind everybody is it really affects accounting earnings. It doesn't really affect cash flows the same way. And so, if you think about it from a held-to-maturity perspective, the economics of our portfolio don't change one iota from pre-implementation to post-implementation. So I think sometimes it's a little bit of rearranging vectors. That having been said, it's a very complex rearranging of vectors, and there's a number of issues we're still trying to get our arms around such as how do you define the life of a card well, right? Do you do on a FIFO basis where the first dollar borrowed is the first dollar repaid? Do you think about it in a CARD Act hierarchy? How do you think about it? So I think there's a lot of work needs to be done defining those things. So, clearly, reserves will go up under CECL. And it's clearly our intent, as we have a good sense of where that's going to be, we obviously will telegraph that to you guys. It's preliminary at this point, though. Donald J. Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, Mark. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Please go ahead. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Good afternoon. Wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the trend and rewards costs. I know it ticked down a bit this quarter. And are you still expecting maybe in that 128 to 130 range in terms of basis points as you look out for the year? Thanks. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. I think that's the way to think about it. Again, if we had felt the need to revise guidance, we'd be doing that. To the extent you're looking at year-over-year and wondering about that, I think the big change is \u2013 it is up year-over-year, a big chunk of that is we ran gas in the first quarter as one of our 5% rotating categories. Whenever you run gas, it's extremely attractive to people, and they jump on that. So I'd say that would really explain the year-over-year number. But full year, we feel very good about that earlier guidance. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. I figured that was the year-over-year driver. And then, separately, and just getting back to the receivables growth discussion again, I hear you about the potential ticking back a little bit or moderating a bit. Are you seeing any signs yet just in terms of the transaction volumes and card volumes, around any pickup in spending that's evidenced with your customers post tax reform? Is that something that's clearly becoming evident? Thanks. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Well, so it's David. I would say that the number of days in the quarter processing skewed our numbers a little. If you look at it like-for-like days, we had about 8% year-over-year growth in volume for the first quarter, which was stronger than it's been in the past. Now I can't say yet if that is attributable to tax reform or whether it's just attributable to our value proposition and us gaining share, because some of the retail reports I've seen have not suggested so much of a pickup yet in the first quarter. I do think that, given that some of the withholding has just kicked in, in the last six or eight weeks for people, that people are going to do one of two things with a couple of percent extra money in their pocket. They're either going to save it more or they're going to spend it. And I suspect consumers will do some of each. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Got it. Okay. Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good evening, guys. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Hey, Ryan. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, Mark. David, maybe just to follow up on, I think, the comments that Mark had made regarding promotional balances. I know this is a channel that historically you guys have come in and out of. Can you maybe just talk about competitively what you're seeing there that's causing us to potentially see some slowing growth in that channel? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Well, I think he mentioned specifically balance transfer pulling back a bit. And one of the factors is obviously the economics changed a little bit just with the higher interest rates. And also, we're constantly adjusting our models. We use promotional rates to drive better profitability. If it's cheaper to invest in promo rates than higher marketing costs, we look at that as almost another marketing costs, if you will. So I wouldn't say \u2013 we don't tend to go guardrail to guardrail on anything, but we're always making adjustments as we review the data and find opportunities. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And Mark, maybe I can ask Sanjay's question a little bit of a different way, given that we needed your assistance to get us into the right place for the first quarter. I guess when I think about what's transpired over the last couple of quarters, the reserve as of the end of the year was running about 40 basis points above last year's charge-off level. Given that you're growing at a nice clip, but delinquencies are increasing at a stable to improving pace, you highlighted what's been happening with charge-offs, would you expect us to start to see more convergence between charge-offs and the reserve level? Or given the normalization that's going on, would you expect that gap to kind of remain in a similar range I guess it's been the last couple of quarters? Thanks. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. I got to be really careful with that one, Ryan, because that could be back \u2013 you can back into provision guidance on that one, so I'm going to be careful. How about if I tackle it a little differently and just kind of say, from my perspective, we continue to feel really good about the way credit is seasoning. If you look at it this quarter, it's about 40% driven by the seasoning of new accounts. It's about 60% to normalization on the back book. Roughly speaking, that continues to be in line with our expectation. It also continues to be in accordance with all of the return metrics under which we're underwriting this credit. So we feel very good about the nature of the credit we're putting on the books. We talked the last quarter about potentially directing some incremental growth dollars towards some segments. We haven't fully deployed all that at this point in time. And at the end of the day, we may not end up fully deploying all of it. Just to be clear, if we can't find risk-adjusted returns and ways to deploy that that are consistent with our models, right? Again, we're not going to bend from the discipline in terms of how we grow. So, continue to feel really good about what we're putting on the books, continue to feel very good about the trajectory of credit. Appreciate your comment about delinquency rates basically, 27, 24, 27 basis points, I think up the last couple quarters. They've really flattened out to a large degree, and we feel good about where we are. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I appreciate all the color, Mark. Thanks. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries from Barclays. Please go ahead. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. David, to what extent do you attribute kind of the above-industry receivables growth to the Cashback Match offer, which really was kind of unique in that it provided an upfront incentive to encourage a customer to engage for a full year rather than three months? And what impact, if any, do you think you'll see on that growth with probably one of the most direct competitors, the Freedom Unlimited, effectively matching that in the last week? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Well, Mark, I think that it's a combination of differentiating features and strong execution that have allowed us to grow faster than the industry average the last year-and-a-half or so in particular. Certainly, Cashback Match is one of those things, but Social Security numbers on the dark web and on/off freeze functionality and the fact that we have our own brand at point-of-sale that is differentiating from the Visa-Mastercard issuers, one of which you mentioned. Yeah, I think it's the cumulative impact of a bunch of stuff. It's no one thing. I guess the second thing I would say is imitation is flattery, but this is, while an important competitor, it's one program. It'll be X percentage of total marketing that we're up against. And overall, we think the package that we offer is what's attractive to consumers versus any one thing, even Match. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And the second question, David, are you prepared at all yet to comment on kind of what your expectations and objectives are for growing the new checking product over the next couple years? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : I'm sorry. You said the \u2013 you asked about the \u2013 what you could expect in checking for the next two years? Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: The new checking product that you guys \u2013 yeah. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : We're really excited by it, but I think it's going to be a gradual build because this is a long-term play. By nature, checking accounts tend to be sticky. It's what makes them attractive to financial institutions. But that means we'll probably ease into it and focus on testing new things. We're going to be adding some more features mid-year this year. I expect the second half of this year to have more promotional activity than we had the first half of this year. But to put a point on it, I'm not sure you'll see a TV ad in the second half of the year. But we think that, you know, we're going to report our progress as it becomes more material. But I think you should think about over, say, a 5-year period this sort of turning into something material in terms of first-time customers, lower cost funding, stickier relationships, and we're starting off to increase the franchise. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Hey, Betsy. Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Couple of follow-ups. One on capital. I know you mentioned somewhat below 100%, and I'm sure, Mark, you're not going to tell us what that's defined as numerically. But maybe you can help me understand, is somewhat more or less than modestly? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Maybe you could ask the Fed for us, Betsy. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Look, I think, Betsy, one of the things we talked about earlier was in the first quarter when we saw provisions coming in a little bit high in sort of some of the models, we gave a little bit of a nudge just to make sure that folks kind of recalibrated. I guess, really sort of what we're trying to do in part based on what we're saying here is that for those folks who are thinking in their modeling currently something north of 100%, maybe the thought process is removing the thought of north of 100% more so than it is how much below 100% should you be. How about that? Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then, as I'm thinking about that, is there anything you can tell us with regard to dividend versus buyback? Like, does it make more sense to keep the divi flat and not flex the buyback as much? Or do you want to see that growth in dividend year-in, year-out and flex it in the buyback? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So I would say I think we've been pretty consistent over the last four or five years that we do have a goal of being an S&P Dividend Achiever. That requires dividend increases. I wouldn't change or dissuade anybody from thinking that remains a piece of our thought process. That being said, the magnitude of increases can vary, obviously, too. So, as we went through our submission, we looked and we recalibrated some of those things. And in terms of exact detail, we'll have to wait until we get results back from the Fed and we can share it with you then. Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom from UBS. Your line is open. Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Just a couple more questions about provision. I know it's a topic we've labored over. But first, Mark, historically, March or April has tended to be a low for credit experience just because people use tax refunds and things to get a little bit caught up and that kind of thing. Is that something that you continue to expect to be true? Or is something changing in terms of the seasonal nature of losses? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : No. I think there's definitely the tax refund impact that comes in. I would say they're delayed a little bit this year is one thing to keep in mind. And the other thing I would point out in this construct, it's not \u2013 I want to be abundantly clear, we don't have data that supports causality. But simply, correlation, we saw a pretty significant improvement in our payment rates and in our delinquency trends start at the very week when the payroll processors adjusted withholdings. Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So I do think there's something going on here as we talked earlier briefly with that additional discretionary income that folks have seen as well. Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Got it. And then just in terms of \u2013 I know this has been asked a couple of different ways, but I just want to make sure I'm fully understanding how to reflect your commentary about growth in terms of the provision as well. So, all else equal, if growth is tailing a little bit, I recognize that you're talking about a moderate extent, but if growth is tailing a little bit, would that, all else equal, suggest that the provision increment should also be diminishing in line? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : I would say in an all-else-equal environment, yes, with one exception, and that there is a lag associated with that portion of the reserve build that is associated with the growth in new accounts, right? So, if you think about the way a new account seasons, it takes peak season in 24 months after you originate it. So, if it's growth that I put on the books today, I don't have a lot of reserves set up for that yet. That'll come as we roll forward on the calendar. So, yes, but with a modest lag. Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. A question around MDR. If my calculation is correct, I see a 4 to 5 basis point improvement year-on-year. Can you just talk about what's driving it and how should we think about that going forward? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So the big driver there, Ashish, is going to be the mix of merchants. Particularly, quarter-over-quarter, the fourth quarter's heavy spend at big-box type retailers and larger online retailers that typically tend to have lower discount rates. As you move into the fourth quarter, the spend mix shifts more balanced. It's not as heavily concentrated in the big ones. So, that tends to drive a little bit of an uptick in the MDR. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I think that's helpful. Because I also saw it on a year-on-year basis, so that was positively surprising. So, that was positive. So just maybe on... David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Just the one thing I would caution on is that I think that it's more likely that that could have modest pressure over time. The merchant discount rates in general have had some upward pressure as there's been a mix movement towards more card-not-present. But some of the card-not-present merchants are getting much better at anti-fraud kind of capabilities and are able to then earn somewhat lower discount rates. So I would just be cautious not to extrapolate that increase. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Sure. Thanks. And maybe just a quick follow-up. On the funding side, the securitized borrowing in particular, that showed a 24-basis-point sequential increase in rate from 2.19% to 2. 43%. I was just wondering if there's any particular call out there and how we should think about those rates going forward. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : No. I would say it's just a function of maturities rolling off that were put on several years ago being replaced by new issuances. Some of those new issuances being fixed rate and further out the curve. So I wouldn't think about it as anything other than just positioning the balance sheet the way we want to see it going forward. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. That's helpful. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. My name must be the easiest to actually pronounce. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : You and Ryan. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. The question also relates to credit. And I want to square a few things here that have been said both this evening and as well as in prior calls. But I understand you've got a healthy consumer and there's plenty of confidence in the consumer remaining strong for a variety of reasons. You've noted that you've got seasoning in the normalization of credit impacting credit results, which I guess kind of given the nature of the beast, you've kind of pointed to supply availability as being one of the big drivers of that and you seem to be one of the marginal providers of credit. So I guess I'm a little kind of questioning as to whether the results that you're going to see in the future actually do kind of live up to your expectations, just given that your loss rates are actually higher across the board on a year-over-year basis than anybody else in the sector. So it seems that things are changing here a little bit more quickly. So, if you could just help us understand kind of that vector that would be quite helpful. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Well, I guess if you look at the data, we have had somewhat of a higher increase than some others because we were the lowest of the players. And I'd say that if you look at the prime related large issuers, it's actually very tight now. And I think that of the four big prime issuers, we're all within about 10 or 20 basis points, which is the closest we've been in years. And so, when we talk about normalization, I think some of the other players had to normalize from abnormally high things, charge-offs, as they continue to work off the problems of pre-downturn loose credit, whereas we have the benefit of having a very fantastic credit. But we're at a range where being in the low-3% charge-off rate for a prime credit card is great and our underwriting assumptions assume higher than that through the cycle. And so the way I think about it is, if we had expected to be close to 2% charge-off rates indefinitely, we would have been leaving a lot of money on the table and would have been under-extending credit. So, to me, this is kind of a more natural move. Yes, it's painful because we have to put up those resources that we had to be release on the way down. And I do expect if unemployment rate stays at 4%, housing prices continue to rise, everything continues to be nice, that things ought to stabilize here at some sort of new normal rate level. And what we're seeing so far is consistent with that. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And would you be willing to share what the tenure of the charge-off accounts are? Are these new accounts that have been acquired that just didn't work out? Or are these somewhat aged that are being charged off after being long-term customers? Can you give us some sense as to the nature of the charge-offs? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Hey, Ken. Maybe the best way to think about it, as I said, if you think about the reserve build, 40% of it was related to new accounts, 60% of it was related to the back book. So I think that's already been asked and answered. Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. First question for me just on the comment you made, Mark, about that compensation and any growth there will be a function of growth elsewhere in the business. Are you feeling any pressure on the compliance side to bring in more people or increase salaries there? Or sort of have we reached the end of that process or even are we at a place where we think we'd see some shrinkage in some compliance related and consultant-like spending? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. I would say I wouldn't attribute the increase in the 9% year-over-year growth to compensation. I would say the vast majority of the increase would be coming in other categories more broadly. Compensation in and of itself was a chunk of it. I would say that was more broad-based across the company as opposed to really being focused in the regulatory side of the equation. I do believe we are encouraged by what we see being discussed in Washington on tiering and failing in regulatory reform. We do believe that there's sincerity in Washington that folks really want to advance and move this forward. To this point in time, I would say we've seen glimmers, but think about this, your CCAR where I think we just telegraphed, so it's a tougher CCAR this year than we've seen in years past. So what I would say is, right now, it feels like we're in that awkward period of time where the pendulum on the grandfather clock is swinging and it hangs there for a second before it swings the other way. So I would think about compliance spend really as being more stable now as opposed to being on either an increasing or a decreasing trend. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : And I might add more broadly that we're pleased to be at around 38% efficiency ratio, pleased that again we've been achieving positive operating leverage, growing expenses faster than revenues. And that operating leverage being one of the best in the industry doesn't mean that we don't have other opportunities to maybe over a multiple year period to push that a little bit lower. And I think compliance-related expenses, can we automate some things and can we mature some things, regardless of any regulatory changes that may or may not happen, we view as an opportunity. But artificial intelligence, technology, there's a lot of \u2013 our direct business model does lend itself to really taking advantage of new technologies to drive more and more efficiencies. And so we're focused on that. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. And then, just thinking about one of the conversations earlier in the call about how competition affects your growth rate in loans and thinking about the 10% year-on-year growth in credit card loans this quarter. Can you give us a little commentary around the actions you \u2013 like, when did you take the actions that generated that 10% growth? Because I think about some of the issues with Discover it that ultimately caused spending and then caused loan growth. Some of these things seem like they're multi-year efforts that result in loans now and then some are like balance transfers that are more near-term. Anyway, you guys are always striking a balance. Can you just give us some comments on your thoughts there? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. I'll take the first stab and then David can pile on. I guess I'd start by reminding you that one of the things we said is we really haven't changed over the course of the last several years our approach to the business. We were willing to underwrite to a loss rate that is higher than where we are today, that continues to be the case, with a certain cost to acquire the account, and then think of that card acquisition model like an NPV calculation essentially is how you think about it. And I think we said before, we target a return that's greater than the return on the buyback program, plus a risk premium, plus a credit premium. And then we also want to see break-evens generally speaking inside of five years, right? So, that's the rubric we have used going back for a number of years now. And what we saw is if you go back four years ago, I might be off by a year or so, we were outgrowing the prime market by about 400 basis points using that same general rubric. Then others came back into the market surging or just consistently back in the market in the case of some players. What we saw is they were willing to pay acquisition costs we weren't willing to pay. So, candidly, our growth rates fell not because we chose to peel back on growth, just because others were willing to pay more to get the accounts. Now that those others have backed out of the market more, what you see is that same underwriting model is producing the higher levels of growth. So I wouldn't think about it as so much what we're doing differently as opposed to really the market dynamic itself has shifted. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : And I would say that's essentially what I was going to say. I would just summarize that we tend to be consistent, but we are impacted by less consistent competitors. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Got it. Thanks very much. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler from Buckingham. Please go ahead. Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, Mark, looking at the card yield up about 20 basis points year-over-year. Can you help me think about the factors that are weighing on that? I feel like there's a little bit of a missing link between the increase in the prime rate and the increase in your card yield. I understand there's some mix issues, also interest charge-offs. I guess the one piece I don't know is to the extent that consumers are paying off their balances more in full as you shift more into a spend-centric model with some of your advertising. Is that a big factor? Is there anything else I'm missing? And a related question, as the promotional activity fades a little bit as you discussed and also potentially charge-offs level off, can we see that card yield do a little better in the second half of the year? Thanks. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, so I'm not going to prognosticate on the card yield trajectory, but I'll go ahead and talk about the bits and pieces that have affected it heretofore. I think you are correct, there is an element of charge-offs of accrued interest that are flowing through there that are a piece of it. And I think you've seen the uptick in charge-offs over the course of the last year. A piece of that, obviously, is going to be mirrored on the interest and fees side of the equation. Promotional balances, the other component you called out, promotional balances right now are sitting at about 21% of the total book. That's not all balance transfers. Some of that is other things as well. Those balance transfers obviously have an impact though, because they carry a yield which is equivalent to the fee being accreted into yield over the life of the BT if there's a fee associated with it. 0% all the way if there isn't. So, that higher level of promotional activity has had some muting effect as well. I would say those would be really the two big pieces. And then, of course, you have the piece of the book that's just transactors, right? So you're not going to see the transactors. The bigger your transactor book is, obviously the more of a muting effect that has on your overall card yield in the book, as those books don't revolve. So those would really be the component parts and pieces. Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. An unrelated follow-up question. Really excited about this deposit product; it seems like it could be a little of a game-changer for the company. What's the hesitation? It doesn't seem like there's a lot of risk from a credit perspective on doing more of a fuller roll-out of a checking product. Why the caution on rolling out what could be a pretty unique differentiated product in today's market? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Well, I would just say, while there's not credit risk, there's certainly fraud risk, and so we have to be cautious there. And secondly, the traditional distribution for checking accounts has been branches. And I think that consumers increasingly will acquire their checking accounts in a digital fashion, but we are a pioneer in that. And so I believe that as a pioneer, it will take time to literally change consumer behavior in the country. But long-term, I believe we're best positioned of anyone I can think of to revolutionize that, but I think it will take time. Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli from William Blair. Please go ahead. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon. A question on the Payments businesses. The PULSE and the Network Partners continue to show strong growth. And the net income in that segment, you mentioned some things for the $45 million. Is that a real number; a sustainable number? I mean, it was a pretty significant increase over the trend. And what is your outlook for the growth of those businesses? Do you want payments, now that you have some momentum, to become a much bigger part of the business over time? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So I'll speak to the numbers themselves, and David can speak to division for payments here. I guess what I would say, Bob, is I feel good about the numbers. I feel good about the trajectory of the numbers that we're looking at at this point in time. The PULSE put up some very strong growth. In that particular case, I would say there were no particular elephants who presented, you know, no giant wins in the quarter or anything like that that really drove that growth. It was far more granular across the board in our traditional marketplace of smaller FIs and some mid-tier FIs as well. So I would say, feel very good about what the team has done there. I would say the AribaPay volume continues to pick up nicely, feel very good about the trajectory we've got there as well. So, if I think about the business more broadly, it feels like there's a number of things that are really beginning to fire on a number of different cylinders and it really feels like we've turned the corner from a couple years ago when we were facing what we thought were some pretty anti-competitive actions on the part of some of our competitors. And David, do you want to speak to the division? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : And I would just say that I'm not sure I, you know, 19% growth is awesome, but hard to maintain for very long. But if we can maintain 10%-plus double-digit growth, we did that in the early years of PULSE, and I'm glad we're back in double-digits. And I would just say that we are looking very hard at opportunities in the U.S. and around the world to really capitalize on this very scarce and, in our view, very valuable network that has the ability to scale to a whole lot more volume. But most of that volume today is locked up by Visa and Mastercard, and we're looking for non-traditional ways to unlock it. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: The Ariba business, I mean is that the B2B payments business, are there other partners? I mean that is a massive market. I'm not sure if you're looking to become a much bigger player in the B2B payments market or not, but AribaPay, I mean it's nice, it's one partner, and it's starting to be some real volume. But what is the rest of the game plan in that business? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : I'd say that Ariba is just one of the places that we're placing bets. We're seeing some continued good volume growth, but it is a very skinny margin business. So I would not say that we're staking our whole payment strategy on AribaPay or it's taking our strategy on placing a bunch of bets. I'd say the one that I would point out is the net-to-nets. We're up to about 14 global players that we partnered with and we continue to sign a few more every year. And in the long-term, the nice thing about that is it comes with some cross-border business. And as you know, that is the highest margin business in payments. And so it's maybe a little easier for me to see us monetizing and having that contribute to the profit sitting here right now today than what I would say on AribaPay. But we'll keep looking at AribaPay. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jill Shea from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Jill Shea - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks so much for taking my question. Just following up on CECL, realizing that there's a lot of moving parts and it's still in proposed form, could you touch on your view then potential implications that you saw on regulatory capital ratios? Thanks. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. So it's hard to know what the impact of the ratio is going to be until we know what the absolute impact on the reserve level is going to be because, obviously, that initial hit is going to not be a P&L event, it's going to be a capital hit as you adopt CECL. So what I would say is the regulators did come out and make a statement that I think it might have been that they're leaning toward \u2013 I'm sorry not as they're leaning towards, they actually have agreed now to allow for a three-year phase-in of the regulatory capital impact to CECL. So, that obviously eases the transition there to the extent the numbers are large. But I would say that really being able to triangulate more on the reg cap impact itself requires us to be able to triangulate more on the absolute magnitude of the delta in reserves that I think we're still working through a number of issues. Jill Shea - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : You bet. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : So, looks like there may be no more questions? Am I right about that? Operator : Yes. There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Craig Streem for closing comments. Craig Streem - Discover Financial Services : Thanks. Thanks, everybody, for your attention. And of course, any follow-up, we're available whenever you need us. Thanks. Bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP Operator : Good afternoon, my name is Salacia and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2018 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Craig Streem - Discover Financial Services : Thank you, Salacia. Welcome, everyone, to our call this afternoon. As always, I'll begin on slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8-K report, and in our 10-K and first quarter and 10-Q, which are on our website and on file with the SEC. In the second quarter 2018 earnings materials, we've provided information that compares and reconciles the company's non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial information. And we also explain why these measures are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's call. Our call will include remarks from David Nelms, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, covering second quarter highlights and developments; and then Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. And then, as Salacia said, we will have time for Q&As following the formal comments. Appreciate it if you'd limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so we can accommodate everyone during the time that we have. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to David. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, Craig, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. In our second quarter, we earned $669 million after tax or $1.91 per share, generating a return on equity of 25%. This performance reflects a simple strategy, focus on the customer, maintain a disciplined approach to credit, and invest for long-term profitable growth. And as you can see from our results, effective execution of this strategy continues to generate outstanding returns. These returns primarily reflect strong revenue growth, which itself is a function of outstanding receivables growth, particularly in the card business. Over time, we've invested in brand advertising, in marketing analytics, in superior service and in enhancements to our rewards offerings. And together, these investments continue to drive profitable loan and revenue growth from a balanced mix of new accounts and existing cardholders. Turning to our other lending products. In student loans, we are just entering the peak season and early origination activity looks good, and it's consistent with our internal projections. In personal loans, competition continues to intensify. Just to illustrate, the industry sent more direct mail for personal loans in the first half of this year than it sent for credit cards. And industry pricing and credit standards seem to be focused more on near-term growth than long-term returns. As a result, we are continuing to cut back on origination activity, as we see less opportunity for profitable growth in this portfolio in the near-term. In fact, we expect personal loans receivables to be flat to potentially down over the second half of this year. Turning to credit, performance remained strong with charge-offs flat and delinquencies down 15 basis points on a sequential basis. This reflects a number of factors. First, we've maintained our disciplined approach to underwriting. Second, we've seen meaningful benefit from our investments in advanced analytics, modeling and machine learning. And finally, the strength of the U.S. economy has certainly helped. In addition to our Direct Banking business, in Payment Services, good business momentum drove a 14% increase in volume and an 11% increase in income before tax on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, we returned $656 million of capital through dividends and share repurchases, and have raised our quarterly common stock dividend by another $0.05, or 14%. In summary, this was another very solid quarter, led by the terrific performance of our card business. Looking at the economic environment for prime consumers, all indications suggest that economic conditions remain favorable. Overall, we feel very good about our ability to continue to generate strong risk-adjusted returns with a continued tailwind from the economy enhancing our ability to deliver profitable growth. I'll now ask Mark to discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, David, and good afternoon to everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide 4. Looking at key elements of the income statement, revenue growth of 8% this quarter was driven primarily by strong loan growth. The increase in provision was largely consistent with ongoing supply-driven normalization in the consumer credit industry, as well as the seasoning of loan growth. Operating expenses rose 8% year-over-year as a result of the investments David alluded to in support of growth and new capabilities. Turning to slide 5, total loans increased 9% over the prior year, led by 10% growth in credit card receivables. Growth in standard merchandise balances drove much of this increase, spurred by accelerating sales growth. Promotional balances were a modest contributor to our strong performance, although balance transfer volume came in above our expectations for the quarter. Looking forward, we expect balance transfer activity to slow and for the mix of promotional balances in the portfolio to gradually decline. Looking at our other primary lending products, year-over-year growth in personal loans was 5%. And as David said, originations are expected to continue to slow. Private student loan balances rose 2% in aggregate, but our organic portfolio increased 10% year-over-year. Moving to the results from our Payment segment. On the right-hand side of slide 5, you can see that proprietary volume rose 9% year-over-year, up from 8% last quarter. This increase was driven by two primary factors. First; a high level of customer engagement with our 5% category, which was supermarkets this quarter. And second, higher gas prices. In our Payment Services segment, PULSE volume growth was once again strong this quarter, with 14% higher volume compared to the prior year, driven by both new issuers, as well as incremental volume from existing issuers. Diners Club volume rose 8% from the prior year, on strength from newer franchises. And Network Partners volume increased 33%, driven by AribaPay volume. Moving to Revenue on slide 6, net interest income increased $191 million, or 10% from a year ago, driven by a combination of higher loan balances and higher market rates. Total non-interest income was down $7 million, due to a decline in net discount and interchange revenue. Gross discount and interchange revenue grew in line with sales. But higher rewards costs more than offset that impact due to higher customer engagement in the 5% promotional rewards category. As I mentioned earlier, this was driven by our decision to feature groceries this quarter. We remain comfortable with our expectation for the rewards rate for the year. As shown on slide 7, our net interest margin rose 10 basis points from the prior year, and was down 2 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at 10.21%. Relative to the second quarter of last year, the net benefit of a higher prime rate and a favorable shift in funding mix were partially offset by an increase in promotional balances and higher interest charge-offs. Relative to this year's first quarter, the net benefit of a higher prime rate was more than offset by strong engagement on the part of transactors, and higher promotional balances, which as I noted earlier, are expected to decline as a percentage of the portfolio over the remainder of the year. On balance, we remain comfortable with our outlook for net interest margin for the full year. Total loan yield increased 30 basis points from a year ago to 12.28% as a result of a 22-basis-point increase in card yield, and a 60-basis-point increase in private student loan yield. Prime rate increases and a modest increase in the revolve rate lead card yields higher, partially offset by the impact of somewhat larger promotional balances and higher charge-offs. Higher short-term interest rates drove the increase in student loan yields, where about 60% of the organic portfolio is variable rate in nature. On the liability side of the balance sheet, consumer deposits grew faster than loans, at 12%, up 2 points sequentially. Consumer deposit rates rose during the quarter, increasing 12 basis points sequentially, and 42 basis points year-over-year. Deposit betas have continued to rise, but at this point remain below our cycle-to date-expectations. Turning to slide 8, operating expenses rose $72 million from the prior year. Employee compensation and benefits was higher, the result of increased technology and volume-related head count to support business growth as well as higher average salaries. Marketing expenses were up as a result of greater investment in account acquisition and increased brand advertising. Information processing cost increased due to investments in infrastructure as well as analytic capabilities. We remain comfortable with our operating expense guidance for the full year. I'll now discuss credit results on slide 9. Total net charge-off rates rose 40 basis points from the prior year, and 2 basis points sequentially. As we've talked about over the last year or so, supply driven credit normalization, along with the seasoning of loan growth in the past few years, have been the primary drivers of the year-over-year increase in charge-offs. Credit card net charge-offs rose 40 basis points year-over-year. However, from a sequential perspective, this quarter represented the third consecutive quarter of slowing year-over-year increases in card charge-offs. In addition, delinquency formation slowed. The credit card 30 plus delinquency rate was up 16 basis points year-over-year, but down 17 basis points sequentially. Private student loan net charge-offs rose 7 basis points year-over-year, and were flat sequentially. Personal loan net charge-offs increased 79 basis points from the prior year, but fell 6 basis points sequentially. The 30-plus delinquency rate was up 28 basis points year-over-year and 5 basis points sequentially. Taking into account the delinquency trends as well as the competitive conditions, we have chosen to slow personal loan originations as David noted earlier. Looking at capital on slide 10, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased 30 basis points sequentially as loan balances grew. Our payout ratio for the last 12 months was 118%. On June 28, in conjunction with the receipt of our CCAR non-objection, we announced our capital plan for the four quarters ending June 30, 2019. Specifically, we disclosed planned share repurchases of $1.85 billion over the next four quarters, as well as a $0.05 per share increase in our quarterly common stock dividend. We remain focused on efficiently deploying our shareholders' capital by driving profitable and disciplined asset growth and returning excess capital via dividends and share repurchases. To sum up the quarter on slide 11, we generated 9% total loan growth and a 25% return on equity. Our consumer deposit business also posted robust growth of 12%, while deposit rates increased 42 basis points year-over-year. With respect to credit, while our charge-off rates have risen, as credit conditions normalize and loan growth seasons, performance remains consistent with both our expectations and our return targets. And we're continuing to execute on our capital plan with strong loan growth and a leading payout ratio helping to bring our capital ratio closer to target levels. In conclusion, we're pleased with our performance this quarter, and are confident in our outlook for the balance of the year. That concludes our formal remarks, so now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Salacia to open the line for Q&A. Operator : And we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. David or Mark, maybe you could talk about the personal loan product and your decision to slow it down. What's the nature of the competition entering the market? Is it, kind of, fintech players or is it more traditional players? And how do you envision it playing out in terms of getting back in if you wanted to? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Well, first, we're not in any way exiting that business. It's a great business, and we basically need to pull back the growth to maintain our returns, but we're still putting on new accounts, just, probably it will be fewer than needed to replace attrition by the end of this year. And I would say that a lot of it is fintechs. I don't know \u2013 I guess you'd call Goldman, I don't know if you really called him a fintech, but you've got some people like them that haven't traditionally been in the business that are also entering. It is by far the easiest product to enter, a lot easier than credit cards or student loans. And we have seen this in past cycles, where people enter, and a lot of times a crisis sorts things \u2013 a credit cycle sorts things out. But I would just say that mainly these new entrants have produced, as I mentioned, more direct mail in the first half of this year than credit cards. And that market is about 15% the size of credit cards. So, there's a lot going out there. And that impacts cost per account, but also the availability of credit will impact credit, and so to maintain our discipline, we need to selectively tighten and be more selective on how we're marketing. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : And I think, Sanjay, I'd just add to that. I mean, we've been pretty consistent all along, in saying global domination in this business has never made sense, right? It's a business where discipline and humility matter a great deal. And risk-adjusted returns rule the way we think about things at Discover. So it's just time to feather the accelerator a little bit. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: I appreciate that. I guess my follow-up question is, obviously, I'm sure you've seen today's announcement of Walmart, sort of, switching issuers. I'm curious if you have any updated views on the private label space, or even the co-brand space if an opportunity presented itself? Maybe you could talk about your appetite to get into that market. And then also, how the backdrop is with the BSA/AML issue, in terms of making a deal of any sort? Thanks. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. While the private-label business, I think, could fit strategically, I think the entry paths are limited. And I think it's probably unlikely for us, at least in the near-term. What was your second question? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Co-brands. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Co-brands. One of the things we have is the Discover brand. We're not issuing Visa/Mastercards. We have differentiation. We have leading service, and frankly, optimizing and extending Discover-branded products, I think has shown to produce the highest returns. And we're also outgrowing, at the moment, all those people who actually have co-brand programs. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good evening. Mark, just want to talk a little bit more about the NIM. I know it looks like you came in a little bit lower than expected around some promo activity, but you're keeping the full year guidance. I mean, it implies a nice uptick. I guess I want to just, kind of, get a sense of your confidence there, just given that it can be so variable based on the mix of the portfolio. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, absolutely, I would say, Don, maybe the right place to start is a quick walk to Q1. So if you think about the benefit of the Fed rate increase we saw go through there, just on a pure rate per rate basis point, that was a 10 basis point good guy in the quarter to NIM. We had 12 basis points of bad guys that were essentially half and half. BT and promo mix in the portfolio coming in higher than we thought it would be, and then a real uptick in transactor volume, which obviously is a good guy on the gross interchange side of the equation and the sales growth side of the equation, so maybe dilutive to margin in that regard, but obviously a good guy elsewhere on the income statement. Got really good visibility into the BT and the promo mix, already see that coming down, so very comfortable there. Promos right now are about 21% of the book roughly, and we see that declining over the remainder of the year, pretty significantly. So, again, feel good about that. Transactor volume is obviously the wild card. If we continue to see a stronger level of transactor engagement, that could mute it somewhat, but it would still make its way into the range that we've set out for the full year. Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yep. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good evening, guys. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Hey, Ryan. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Mark, maybe just picking up on the back of that last question, just given your expectations for promos to come down from the 21% level, do you have any thoughts on what that could mean for loan growth? And David as a follow-up to that, can you just maybe talk about what you're seeing in the competitive environment for loan growth? Are you seeing any changes to competitor behavior, and what do you think it means for loan growth at this point in the cycle? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So from my perspective, Ryan, I'd say we continue to feel good about that 7% to 9% range we've talked about for total loan growth for the year. Card obviously came in above that range. It came in at 10% this quarter, although down somewhat \u2013 still rounded to 10%, but down somewhat from where it was last quarter. Obviously, with a little less BT and promo volume, we would expect to see some slowing in card loan growth there as we go on through the course of the year, and that's reflected not only in our NIM thoughts for the year, but also our overall financial outlook for the year at this point as well. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : And I would say the competitive environment is pretty stable compared to the last two quarters. It's still well off it's \u2013 I guess frothier stage from a year, year and a half ago, and I think generally, I've seen most of the prime competitors just maybe slowing loan growth to the low single digits, if you take out any acquisitions that they might have had, and sales growth, pretty close to where we are. Maybe a touch higher, but this quarter, our sales growth really moved up quite a bit, and we're right there with the other guys on sales. And I think generally, people \u2013 my take is people started seeing higher rewards cost a year ago, and most recently and started making some adjustments, so we have seen some tapering off of some of the most aggressive rewards programs. We've seen some taping off of marketing spend and volumes, and that has really helped us with some costs per accounts that look really attractive and our ability to maintain a pretty stable rewards rate, and good \u2013 stable pricing, but still growing faster. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then maybe if I could squeeze in one follow-up on credits. Mark, you highlighted second derivative improvement in card. It looks like most products in terms of year-over-year you're seeing better loss rates. So I could just \u2013 I was just hoping you could maybe talk about what you're seeing from the customer base from a credit perspective. David, you alluded to this in your opening remarks. We've heard from a handful of companies, other consumer lenders that severity of loss is improving given that customers are in a little bit better shape. I was just wondering if you are seeing the same thing. And given the improvement that you're seeing, can you talk about what it means for your outlook for charge-offs, could we end up being on the low end of that 3% to 3.25%? Thanks. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : A lot in there, Ryan. I'll try to touch on all of it. I guess I would say, first and foremost, we continue to see quarter-over-quarter a \u2013 what I guess I would call a lessening of the slope of the normalization curve for three consecutive quarters now, in the card space, which feels very good. This quarter about 50% of the reserve build was driven by the front book about 50% was driven by the back book. That's a lesser percentage off the back book, which I'd tell you, we, again, saw the pace of that normalization in the quarter continuing to mute. Not ready to declare a seminal change at this point in time based upon one quarter's trajectory, but at the end of the day, clearly in the quarter we saw improvement in the consumer's ability to service their debt. Overall macro, factors continue to feel good. Leverage is manageable on the part of the consumer. Unemployment's strong. You've got strong consumer confidence, so the environment feels pretty good, and we're very confident in that 3% to 3.25% range we put out there for charge offs on a full year basis. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. I had a follow-up question on credit. And I think Mark, the last call you alluded potential benefits you were seeing from tax cuts. I'm wondering if you still see signs of that, and if so, also whether you expect maybe you have a bigger impact towards the beginning of next year when refunds come in, as opposed to what comes through, just as a result of improved withholdings? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, so we did \u2013 Mark, you're right, we did see a coincident improvement in credit along with the \u2013 at the same when payroll processors changed their withholding levels. Can't prove causality there, but there was clearly a coincident change. Since that point in time, though, we think that produced about $100 in the pocket of our average customer give or take. Since that point in time, though, we've seen gas prices creep back up that would theoretically have eaten into that, so it's a little unclear exactly what the net impact, the tax reform is at this point. I'm clearly not a bad guy in and of itself in isolation. But it's a little unclear how much of a good guy it is. The overall improvement we're seeing, in terms of, again, that muting of the pace of growth in that normalization curve on the back book would lead me to conclude it's something more than a $100 in the pockets of every individual consumer that's driving that. But I would say tax definitely belongs as one of the good guys on the list. In terms of what the refund scenario could look like at the beginning of next year, candidly, I don't think we spent a lot of time noodling over that one right now. But it's something good for us to think about as we move forward. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great, thanks. And just a question on the optics of delinquencies and charge-offs in the personal loan portfolio, as you actually potentially shrink that in the coming quarters, and obviously aren't adding as many receivables that are at the very early stage of their seasoning and don't have delinquencies, should we expect that to, kind of, tick up in the coming quarters? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Absolutely. You will see a denominator effect, Mark, as that (00:26:04), that lapping or the slowing of the growth. So I would expect charge-offs in that book to continue to rise from where they are right now. You'll have seasoning of the vintages we have booked. You'll have the normalization that still continues that we just got done talking about in the card space, but clearly applies here as well. You'll have the effect of slowing growth from the sub-segments we exited, that we talked about over the course of the last couple quarters. And then you'll have the incremental effect of the pull-back we're doing here. So, the ultimate dollars of losses we take won't be any higher. But because you won't be bringing on as many new accounts, the denominator effect will kick in, and you'll see the loss rate pick up. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great, thank you. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Just wanted to circle back on that issue of debt service. Mark, you just pointed out that there has been certainly some benefits to consumer tax reform and wage growth. But when we look at the aggregate data, we also see that leverage seems to be growing faster than disposable income. So how do you think about that, particularly with respect to the fact that I think half your growth comes from your existing customer base. So presumably, you're contributing to that growth in leverage. Do you feel that there is an embedded credit risk there that's being fully acknowledged? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. I think that right now as we look, Eric, we see the consumers' level of leverage, in our book, as measured by debt-to-income really coming back toward the levels it was at prior to the crisis, so let's call it normalization. But the nature of that leverage has changed pretty dramatically. Prior to the crisis, the vast majority was variable rate in nature and was housed in an ARM. So, as rates were rising, that consumer had a real double whammy and came under a significant degree of stress. Today, less than 10% of the consumer debt out there is variable rate. So you've got fixed rate and most of the growth that we have seen of recent years too has been really in fixed-rate product. It's been in Federal student loans, it's been in auto loan, it's been in personal loan. So, it feels like the levels of leverage are really returning to more normal levels, but that the composition of that leverage feels a little bit healthier than we saw before. But clearly, that has been what's been driving the normalization that we've been experiencing along with all the other issuers in the back book. We're not seeing big movements in incidence rate. It's up a little, but we're not seeing big movements in incidence rates. It's really severities that are up. And that's just because when people go bad, they're carrying more debt, and the losses that all the lenders take are bigger. Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC : Sure. And if I can just follow-up one question on deposit pricing. I think you indicated 31 basis points in the quarter, which looks to be about what effective Fed funds rate moved in the quarter. So, I know you're well below the through-the-cycle average. But how do we think about the marginal cost of deposit pricing from here, and as it relates to your net interest margin? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, so the marginal beta was 10 basis points that we saw on the last Fed move. The cumulative beta thus far, since the rates have started rising, has been 46. So continue to feel good about that. There has been a high degree of variability, in terms of \u2013 I think with the excess liquidity the Fed pumped into the system with their QE and the tapering hasn't gone on long enough now. You still have an excess of deposits kicking around in the system a little bit. And that's made the path of normalization of beta a little bit lumpier than it would have otherwise been because we've seen betas on some rate moves as high as 80. Again, the beta on the most recent move was 10 bps and cumulatively, we're sitting at a 46 since rates started to rise. So we feel really good about that, and we think a big chunk of that performance is tied to the fact that 60% of those depositors have got a relationship with us on the asset side of the balance sheet. Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, guys, for taking my questions. Mark, we definitely see what you're pointing out, in terms of the trends on delinquencies and charge-offs starting to flatten out. And I think one of the other trends that's emerging is normal seasonality is re-emerging into the numbers. As this occurs, I'm curious, will we see the year-over-year provision expense start to converge back towards asset growth? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, it's probably a step further than I'm prepared to go at this point in time, would be the honest answer, Rick. Not ready to declare victory on that point yet. We've had a couple of quarters watching that normalization flatten. We've had a couple of quarters where normal seasonality seems to be occurring. So I agree with all your data points. Just not quite ready to make that call at this point in time. But we do feel very good and constructive about the credit environment. And we're hopeful that we actually do get comfortable making that call at some point here. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So perhaps asking the question in a slightly different way, unlikely at this point that the reserve rate will continue to rise in the way that it has over the last year, it started to flatten \u2013 it started to stabilize the last couple quarters? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah I would say that \u2013 we set the reserves on a quarterly basis, and we set them based on what we see emerge in the course of that quarter, in terms of 12-month-forward-looking losses. So we're too early in the quarter this year for me to be able to sit back and prognosticate on exactly what that's going to look like. I would be so bold as to say we continue to see that flattening that we talked about earlier continue thus far in the quarter. So, that's obviously a positive indicator. But reserves will set once we have the benefit of a lot more information as the quarter moves on. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Appreciate that. Thanks, Mark. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli, with William Blair. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon, and solid quarter. And you guys have been delivering solid numbers now for years. It's been somewhat hidden, as I think Rick was getting into the growth, the buildup in provisions. And it looks like credit losses are stabilizing. And I know Mark, you're not ready to make that call on credit. But just as we look out, essentially, this company's had pre-tax income of $3.6 billion for five years in a row. And it looks like you're ready to accelerate, and you've reduced the share count dramatically. So the combination of growing earnings and reducing share count, I guess, is what the market's looking for to improve your multiple. But as we look out over the next few years, David, what is the model for this company? Is it \u2013 loan growth and operating efficiency is great, but can it improve? How much should it improve? I think technology's allowing improvement. Do you expect loan growth 6% to 8%? Should pre-tax earnings grow at 10% over the medium to long-term? What is the business model for Discover? And what's going to drive that growth? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Well, I would say that we will continue to focus on trying to grow revenues faster than expenses. And for a number of years, we've been having very nice revenue growth. But normalization pushes back against the PBT growth. And yet, we're earning very high returns. So, a lot of the EPS growth has come from buybacks. And if at some point, the normalization slows, that would be what should allow us to then start growing PBT again. But we're not providing guidance at this point. So, I don't want to get into specific targets. But I guess one thing I would say, is that our total asset base is much larger today than it was five years ago. And so essentially we've maintained a PBT while the ROA has gradually come down. I think that's very healthy, because I think a few years ago we were probably overearning. We had, maybe an unsustainably high ROA, if you look at the long-term potential in a card business, and so I think we're now starting off with a more reasonable ROA, and if we can then, kind of, get to a point where we maintain that ROA, but continue to grow our loans, that then translates into PBT growth. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: And I guess that makes sense. Will you revisit? I mean, at one point you had given targets, and I think your last Investor Day and before that you had given longer term targets. Any thoughts of putting out longer term targets or raising your ROE target? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Bob, I would say on that front, that's something we evaluate every year and think about every year, but those are really meant to be through the cycle guides as opposed to annual guides. I'd just kind of \u2013 I'd echo David's comments that the EPS drivers really are going to be in this business, it's loan growth, it's NIM, it's expense management, it's capital management and it's underwriting credit card performance, right? Those are going to be the key levers, and I appreciate in your question, given the way you asked it, because you're right, we focus on long-term value creation and those drivers that we control. And we're not \u2013 at Discover, we're really not going to get caught up in what folks are looking for this quarter or next quarter. We're going to run the compound shareholder value over the long haul. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : And Bob, one thing that I would just add \u2013 we were just looking at some returns back from when we spun off, and our EPS over the year up until last year, was 18% compounded EPS growth. But essentially, it all came the first four year \u2013 or there was a huge jump in the first couple of years. That's when we had a huge jump in PBT, but after the crisis, we had some big reserve releases which gradually diminished. That turn gradually builds. And so it's \u2013 you almost have to look at it across the full cycle, it looks great, but you \u2013 depending on what part of the cycle is, it's lumpy. You get huge surges and then you, kind of, give back the ROA for a period of time. And so we feel really good that we've been able to maintain profitability even with a lot higher charge off rate, and much more normal charge off rate of about 3%, than when we were charging off at 2% and had reserve releases from a number of years ago. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Mark, I know you said you were comfortable with the expense guidance you've given, but looking back over the last few years, at least in two of the last three years, you had about 50% of the annual expenses spent in the first half of the year, and I know there were some unique things going on in some of those years, like with higher regulatory expenses or things tied to some other things. But just wondering if you expect the cadence of expenses this year to be a little bit more back-end weighted, given that you've already had like $1.9 billion in the first half of 2018? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, I would say the expense growth is really a function, Chris, of the business growth, right? So, we talked about it at the beginning of the year when we gave that annual guidance that we were going to be investing a chunk of the benefits of tax reform not only into advanced data and analytics capabilities, but also into some growth-related activities. Those continue throughout the course of the year, and the pacing of those is not exactly linear, I would say, would be the right way to think about it. At the end of the day, we do believe we have the ability to drive the efficiency ratio lower over time. We definitely had a lot more expense leverage in the model than you're seeing out of this, thus far this year, right? But as a kid who grew up on a farm, I'll use my farm analogy and that is you make hay while the sun shines. And we've got a great investment to invest for that growth. We've got a great opportunity to continue to enhance our digital and analytic capability. And back to that thought about running the business for the long haul, this is the year we're choosing to make those investments. You saw 4% positive operating leverage out of us each of the last two years. This is a business model that naturally produces that positive operating leverage. It's just a choice we've made consciously to build for growth this year, to invest for the future this year. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. And then for my follow-up coming on a very different topic, so we recently got the Supreme Court's ruling in favor of American Express on anti-steering rules. Just wondering, not so much on the American Express side, but Visa and Mastercard had their settlements they made, I think in 2011 with the Department of Justice on some steering issues. But I'm not sure much has changed in the market since that time, I think, waiting for what the outcome of what the Amex litigation would be. Anyway, any changes you're expecting to make, now that we're through all this litigation? Or is it pretty much the same as it ever was, for issues around steering and your opportunities? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : For us, it maintains the status quo, and so I don't expect a business impact. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck, with Morgan Stanley. Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good evening. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Hey, Betsy. Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, just a couple of questions. Mark, I think you mentioned earlier around promo balances, that you expected they were going to be falling throughout the year. I wasn't sure, as a percentage of total, I think that's what you meant. But maybe you could give us a little more color as to why you used the word rapidly, and just your outlook there? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, we invested pretty heavily as part of those growth expenses we talked about early in the year, Betsy. And part of that investment, in that case, went toward balance transfer activities. Those mailings and those digital placements have not continued at anywhere near the same pace. Normally when you stop those mailings and digital placements, you start to see fall-off in the volume that's coming on from those offers sooner than we did this time. So, we are now seeing the fall-off from those offers. We're clearly seeing the pieces of the puzzle align that's very comfortable that with a much lower level of balance transfer offering going forward than having changed the program a little bit as well, that that trajectory is going to continue and feel good that we will see 1% or more reduction over the course of the year in the level of promo balances in the portfolio today. Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it, okay. So it's around 1%, okay. And second question was just on transactors. And I know you're looking more for revolvers than transactors, but maybe you can help us understand how you're balancing between wanting to grow sales and having offers that do attract transactors with the balance growth that you're really looking for? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : I'd say, Betsy, our strategy has been very consistent, in that, we target people that are credit worthy, but at least have some propensity to maybe revolve at some point. I think everyone knows that, if you think rewards pretty much offset interchange, if someone's a lifetime transactor, there is no revenue from that customer. And so we've continued to, therefore, focus on profitable resolvers. And some of our boost in transactor volume is more of a return to normal. Because there's fewer competitive offers that were pulling away some of the transactors from us a year ago and two years ago, particularly in some of the Sam's and Costco wars, and some of the people really targeting very high-end transactors. So to some degree, the grocery category also had an impact this quarter, because that seems to be more transacted. But generally, it's just bounced back to probably more normal levels, where loan and sales growth are about the same for us this quarter. Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And do you feel like gas had a material impact, or even noticeable impact on the spend levels this quarter? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : It did. Our gas purchases are up 25% year-over-year. And that was a negative for several years, and it's flipped around to be a positive. Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache, with Nomura Instinet. William Carcache - Nomura Instinet : Thank you. Good evening. Mark, can you give us an update on what's happening specifically with negative credit migration in the portfolio? Just wondering whether along with the generally favorable credit trends that you've described, you're perhaps also seeing a notable lessening in the pace of customers that you've underwritten as prime credits, but are falling to sub-prime, and if so, why you think that is? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : We have seen in the most recent quarters a slowdown in the rate of a drop-off from the above 660, into the below 660 book. So yes, we have seen that. I really don't want to hazard a guess for you here on the call in terms of exactly what the moving parts and pieces of that are, other than to point back to what we've already talked about, and that being specifically the level of normalization, that curve is beginning to become muted. I think the people who were overleveraged are, kind of, working their way through the system at this point in time a little bit. And at this point, looking at the roles in the buckets, looking at the current delinquency situation, credit is encouraging, right? That's not saying we expect credit to turn around and start having reserve releases, I don't want you to misunderstand. But clearly we see a very clear path where the health of the book is clearly still very good, and any signs of stress are moderating. William Carcache - Nomura Instinet : Understood, thank you. If I may as a follow-up, what's the level of deposit beta where you think we'll no longer see NIM flow through benefit from additional rate hikes? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Considerably high right now. That 46 cumulative beta we're sitting at right now, is well below what our through the cycle expectations are, and the 10 basis point marginal beta on the most recent move is obviously \u2013 the 40 beta, rather, with the 10 basis point move is obviously well below. So, I would say we still have rate good guys from the positioning of the balance sheet and the deposit book. William Carcache - Nomura Instinet : Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yep. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Buckingham. Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Mark, sort of, circle back on the NIM for a second, you did a nice job of, sort of, walking through the quarterly progression. But can you maybe discuss the annual progression. Like I just noticed 22 basis points on the card yield year-over-year after 100 basis points plus of Fed moves. I know there's lots of different factors that go into that, but you haven't really moved the sub-prime percentage that much. The one thing we can see hasn't moved that much. Obviously transactors have an effect, promotional balances, but 22 basis points seems real low, and is there a lag and maybe that can continue to catch up with some of the Fed moves? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So the book re-prices, if you think about it, on the next cycle date after a Fed move. So, there's not a particularly large lag on the revolving balances we have. I think you rightly called out the moving parts and pieces. It's the level of promotional activity, which is coming in higher than we expected it to in the first half of the year, which has had a muting effect on that card yield number for sure. And the level of transactors we saw emerge in the book, obviously has a muting effect as well, because ultimately at the end of the day, that's a zero percent interest earning balance you're carrying. So, our NIM guidance in terms of sticking to our full year thoughts obviously implies we expect to see improvement in the combination of those categories. So, I would expect you'd see more flow through to card yield as we look forward here. Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great, thanks. And then a quick follow-up on, maybe for David. Just an update on the checking accounts, the debit rewards products. It seems like a really exciting opportunity and was just hoping for additional update there in terms of traction and when are you going to go full scale and launch that product? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : Well, we're very pleased with the results in the first half of the year. We've had virtually no marketing, but with the redesign of the reward component early this year, we've seen a much higher per month take-up rate, doubled our new accounts per month. We do expect to do some marketing in the second half of the year. We'll be introducing a new plastic design, and some additional feature functionality here shortly, but it will probably be next year before we're really ready to put more serious marketing heft behind it as we continue to get experience on the marketing and the fraud patterns and adding more feature functionality. We want to do this right. It'll be a gradual build. And over the very long term, we think it's very important, but we don't want to go too fast too early. Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: All right, great. Looking forward to that, so. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I wanted to, kind of, just concur with your point on the mail volume in the personal loan business. Your mail volume, though, is probably \u2013 (00:50:22) probably 2.5 times your personal loan business, but you're still doing a couple of hundred million pieces a year. Could you talk a little bit about whether there's anything we should think about on your costs from reducing that, or are you going to be able to reallocate that to other activities? David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : I wouldn't \u2013 we're going to be pulling back, but I don't \u2013 I'm not sure what percentage it is, but don't think that that volume is going to go away for us. I mean we're keeping disciplined. We're mailing segments that work. Our cost per account actually has held up remarkably well considering the volumes. In fact, one of the things that seems to be as a lot of that marketing that we're seeing out there, is not going to the same people that we're sending to. We're seeing people send many more pieces of mail than we think are good credit risks, and we see some people going maybe into sub-prime marketing, which obviously we're not in. So I would think about maybe some expense pullback, but it's not going to be material to the company, and it doesn't get us out of the range that, Mark, kind of, reaffirmed that we expect for the year for the full company. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, I would say Moshe, most of it gets reallocated, right? To the extent there's pullback, we'll reallocate it because we continue to see great opportunities elsewhere to drive great risk-adjusted returns. So, this is not a reflection of some giant concern we have in our personal loan book. It's really more reflective of what we said earlier, there's times when in this business, you want to be on the accelerator, and there's times in this business where you want a slightly lighter foot. And so I think it's really more that and those expenses will get reallocated largely. David W. Nelms - Discover Financial Services : And essentially we'll continue to mark it down to the marginal return being strong, and there's still a lot of good personal loan business out there that has strong marginal returns as long as one keeps the pricing and credit discipline, which we're doing. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Well said. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Just as a follow-up, Mark, in the past you've talked about a lot of different factors, kind of, in addition to the underlying performance of your consumers, but macro factors, we talked a little bit about leverage. Other macro factors when you think about the level of the reserve, how are they performing? And how does that fit into your, kind of, reserve determination? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So the big macros they go into their reserve, Moshe, it would be, unemployment is a biggy. That one is obviously continuing to perform at a benign fashion as you think about the forward 12 months. I think Moody's has been the outlier there in terms of forecasting, and they continue to kick the can down the road on when they see that tick up. I would say nonfarm payrolls would be a big input in terms of what we see, and that continues to go well. Initial bankruptcy claims are a big one. We don't see a significant movement there at this point in time. Consumer confidence is a big input, that remains strong. It's deteriorated a little bit, but remains very strong. That's been just choppy with all of the geopolitical and political noise out there. HPI continues to be a big input. That has continued to be strong across the spectrum, so that's why when we talk about a good environment, Moshe, in which to continue generating quality loans, the backdrop right now continues to feel very healthy on the part of the consumer. It doesn't mean you don't look for those pockets where, okay, there is signs of things getting a little long in the tooth emerging some of these segments in personal loans and the like, and you feather the accelerator there, and you reallocate toward areas where you see additional opportunities. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks so much. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yep. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP : Oh, hi, how are you? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Good, Brian, how are you? Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP : My last question has six parts. First, just to make sure I'm not doing anything stupid, I mean, you went through each of the guidance lines individually, so if I'm looking at the fourth quarter presentation and the six line items you gave ranges on, you're basically saying you're still comfortable with each of those six ranges \u2013 loans, expenses, rewards, NIM, net charge offs, and tax rate. It's all still the same in your mind? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, we didn't say anything about tax rate, but I'll go ahead and say, we're comfortable with the tax rate. Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP : And then just on the NIM trajectory, listening to you, it sounds like it would build through 3Q and then build again into 4Q if it's promos going down and Fed funds going up as two key drivers. Are you thinking like the exit run rate for NIM for the year is closer to 10.50? It seems optically like a big jump. I know you went through it one time. But is that like the implication? It's a 10.50 exit run rate for the year? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : I wouldn't validate the 10.50 number, but I would validate that it's definitely a big jump. There's no question. Through the first two quarters, we're sitting at a 10.22. That's not lost on us in any way, shape, means, or form. And obviously we see a significant movement in the balance transfer and promo portion of the portfolio, as you might imagine, preparing for this call. And we spent a lot of time looking at that and making sure and pressure testing. And we feel confident that we're going to see meaningful uptick in the NIM in the remainder of the year, and that for the full-year basis, that guidance still feels good. The other thing I would say is, just to be clear, maybe give you a little bit of a peek under tent in this regard too, it was never our expectation that NIM was going to be flat, higher across the full course of the year anyway. We knew some of the growth investments we were making earlier in the year would have some muting effect there as well. Again, some of them just had more of a halo effect for longer than we thought they would. Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP : And then if I could sneak two small ones in, on just these dynamics you're talking about, on the balance transfers, is it just a dynamic around how many offers went out and what the take-up was? Or has there been any change relative to what you thought on the maturing balance transfer sticking around at the standard rate? So any thoughts you can give on retention and balance transfers? And then on the transactor and seasonality in two key point \u2013 and it's something you've brought up and CapOne brought up, and USB brought up \u2013 and it wasn't even on my radar screen, is it that transactors were higher than expected or is it just that the transactor drag, now that rates are higher, is a little bit more noticeable and we all, kind of, forgot about the seasonality when rates were at zero for so long. So, maybe if you could just remind us, is that transactor thing something that was unusual this year or something we should think about seasonally every year going forward? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So BT retention at the expiration of the BT continues to be economically positive, continues to perform well. That being said, in a rising rate environment, there's only so much of your balance sheet, you want to allocate to that BT environment. And again, kudos to our marketing team, they designed stuff that really worked and stuck around longer. It worked better than we expected it to. So, we ended up with a little bit more of the balance sheet there. And again, that feathers off as we move forward throughout the remainder of the year pretty meaningfully. But I would say, BTs remain economic. At this point in time, the retention is good there. And the NPV of those offers continue to be positive and good. In terms of the transactor side of the equation, I would say the answer to your question is it it's a both/and. It is both transactors engaged at a higher level, higher degree of velocity. They were a greater portion of our spend increase to this quarter than they have been in a meaningful period of time. And the cost of carrying that transactor float is obviously a little bit higher too, as rates have risen. So, our quarter-over-quarter comment really is reflective more of their percentage competition of the growth. But as time goes on, obviously the cost of that float goes up. And that will be a piece too. Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP : Great. I think I got four in there. So I'll stop there. Craig Streem - Discover Financial Services : You can call us back with the other two. Brian D. Foran - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. Thanks, Craig. Craig Streem - Discover Financial Services : Salacia, I think we're done. What do you think? Operator : Yes, sir. I will now turn the floor back over to Craig Streem for any additional or closing remarks. Craig Streem - Discover Financial Services : Sure. Thanks for your interest everyone. And of course, we are available for any follow-up questions you might have. Thank you, bye. Operator : This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

LLC Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP Jill Shea - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. William Ryan - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Celisia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2018 Discover Financial Services earnings conference call. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Craig Streem - Discover Financial Services : Thank you, Celisia. Welcome, everyone, to this afternoon's call. I'll begin on slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8K report and in our 10-K and Second Quarter 10-Q, which are on our website and also on file with the SEC. In the Third Quarter 2018 materials, we've provided information that compares and reconciles our non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial information, and we explain why these measures are useful to management and investors. And, of course, we urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. As we announced on August 3, effective October 1, Roger Hochschild succeeded David Nelms as Chief Executive Officer of Discover. David and Roger worked together in leading Discover for 20 years, with Roger serving as President and Chief Operating Officer since 2004. Roger's been very active with the investment community in the past, so he should be well-known to many of you. And the transition in leadership should be as seamless to all of you as it's been to our 16,000 colleagues at Discover. Our call today will include remarks from Roger, covering third quarter highlights and developments. Then, Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. And as Celisia said, after Mark completes his comments, there'll be time for questions and answers. But I would ask during the Q&A session, if you would please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so we can accommodate as many participants as possible. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, Craig. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'm tremendously honored to succeed David as CEO. This transition comes with Discover in a great position, generating solid growth and robust returns, and with the Discover brand stronger than ever. Discover represents a unique combination of assets built on a culture that places the highest value on serving our customers, whether by introducing unique features in our card business or innovations in payments. I'm proud to have been part of the team for 20 years and excited to have the opportunity to build upon that legacy as we pursue our aspiration to be consumers' most trusted financial partner. Even with a change at the top, our priorities remain the same. First, the Discover lens-centric business model, integrated with the benefits of our proprietary network, remains at the core. We will continue to invest in the brand, in a differentiated customer experience, and in advanced analytics. And, of course, we'll maintain our consistent conservative approach to credit risk management. This strategy has served us well and continues to produce outstanding results. With that let's turn to slide 3, and review those results for the Third Quarter. We earned $720 million after tax, or $2.05 per share this quarter, generating a return on equity of 26%. This performance reflects the strength of the Discover business model, as well as consistent execution on our strategic priorities. Looking at the fundamentals, total loans grew by 8% in the quarter, led by 9% growth in the card business. This was above industry average, as the Discover brand continues to resonate with our target customers. New accounts were up 14% year-to-date, and we're also seeing higher engagement with both the number of active card members and spending per card member growing nicely. Our private student loan business shows the strength of the Discover brand beyond the card business, setting us up for another year of record originations. Student loan originations during the peak season were up 12%, as a result of improved brand awareness and greater effectiveness in our marketing efforts. In Personal Loans, it's clear the competitive intensity has not lessened, supported by the significant level of capital that has entered the market over the last few years. Much of this competition is from unbranded players, which means that their principal means of differentiation and growth is on price or credit standards. As we said, we will not chase growth that does not meet our return objectives, hence our decision to cut back on origination activity, and we continue to expect personal loan receivables at year-end to be flat to down from the prior year end. Focusing now on Credit. Overall performance is encouraging. In our card portfolio, the seasoning of recent years' vintages, along with continued normalization in the back book are in line with our expectations. In addition, we continue to invest in enhancements, not only in our underwriting processes, but also our servicing platform. We are increasingly leveraging data, advanced analytics, and machine learning to enhance the quality and efficiency of our servicing activities whether in day-to-day customer service or how we collect past-due accounts. This is paying off for us in a variety of ways. It creates a better customer experience, it improves the scalability of servicing operations, and it leads to better credit performance. Turning to Payment Services. The segment generated a healthy 22% increase in pre-tax income, driven by strong volume growth at PULSE, and in our network partners' business. Before I turn the call over to Mark, I want to personally thank David for his leadership over the last 20 years. I'm enormously proud of the business and the team we built together over that time, and I couldn't be more excited about Discover's prospects for the future. I'll now ask Mark to discuss our financial results in more detail. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, Roger, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by addressing our Summary Financial Results on slide 4. Looking at key elements of the income statement, revenue growth of 8% this quarter was driven primarily by strong loan growth. The increase in provision was largely consistent with ongoing supply-driven normalization in the consumer credit industry, as well as the seasoning of our strong loan growth. Operating expenses rose 7% year-over-year, as a result of higher compensation expense, as well as investments in support of both growth and new capabilities. The effective tax rate this quarter was 25.5%, versus our expectation for about 24%, as a result of adjustments to reserves for certain tax matters, which cost us about $0.02 per share. We continue to expect that our effective tax rate for the full year will be about 24%. Turning to slide 5, total loans increased 8% over the prior year, led by 9% growth in credit card receivables. Growth in standard merchandise balances drove much of this increase, spurred by continued strong sales growth. Promotional balances were a modest contributor to growth this quarter, coming in somewhat above our expectations. We are seeing higher-than-expected response rates, a FICO profile north of the portfolio average, and strong economics from these channels. As a result we made a decision to maintain the mix of promotional balances around their current levels as opposed to our prior expectation for them to decline. Obviously, if we see a deterioration in these economics, we'll revisit this approach. Looking at our other primary lending products, year-over-year growth in personal loans slowed to 2%, and, as Roger said, balances are expected to be flat to slightly down on a year-over-year basis by year-end, reflecting the continued impact of credit tightening. Private student loan balances rose 2% in aggregate, but our organic portfolio increased 10% year-over-year. Moving to the results from our Payment segment, on the right-hand side of slide 5, you can see that proprietary volume rose 9% year-over-year. In Payment Services, PULSE volume growth was strong again this quarter, with 14% higher volume compared to the prior year, driven by both new issuers as well as incremental volume from existing issuers. Diners Club volume rose 5% from the prior year on strength from newer franchises, and Network Partners' volume increased 34%, driven by AribaPay volume. Moving to revenue on slide 6, net interest income increased $173 million or 8% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances. Total non-interest income grew $26 million, primarily from a 12% increase in discount and interchange revenue. Sales volume also grew by 12%, led by growth in active card members and, to a lesser extent, higher spend per account. Adjusted for the number of processing days, sales growth was 9%. Our rewards rate for the quarter was 131 basis points, up one basis point year-over-year. As shown on slide 7, our net interest margin was 10.28% for the quarter, flat compared to the prior year and up 7 basis points sequentially. Relative to the third quarter of last year, the net benefit of a higher prime rate is offset by an increase in promotional balances and higher interest charge-offs. Relative to the second quarter, the net benefit of a higher prime rate and modest sequential improvement in interest charge-offs was partially offset by higher deposit costs in both brokered and direct-to-consumer. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are seeing better-than-expected production levels, credit quality and economics in our promotional channels. In addition, we are seeing month-over-month decreases in the portfolio revolve rate, as transactor engagement continues to pick up. For these reasons, we now expect NIM for the full year to come in modestly below our prior guidance of 10.3% to 10.4%. Total loan yield increased 30 basis points from a year ago to 12.45% as a result of a 23 basis point increase in card yield and a 63 basis point increase in private student loan yield. Prime rate increases and a modest increase in the revolve rate led card yield higher, partially offset by a higher mix of promotional balances and higher charge-offs In student loans, where about two thirds of the portfolio has a variable rate, higher short-term interest rates drove the 63 basis point increase in yield. On the liability side of the balance sheet, consumer deposits grew 12% as we continued to shift our funding mix toward more stable and cost-effective sources. Consumer deposit rates rose during the quarter, increasing 17 basis points sequentially and 51 basis points year-over-year. Deposit betas have increased, although cumulative betas continue to be better than historic norms and our expectations. Turning to slide 8, operating expenses rose $67 million from the prior year. Employee Compensation and Benefits was higher, the result of higher average salaries as well as increased volume-related and technology head count to support business growth. Marketing expenses were up as a result of greater investment in generating new loans, and these investments are yielding great returns. For example, in Credit Card, while total marketing dollars are up, acquisition costs per account are down on a year-to-date basis, and we expect that trend to continue through the fourth quarter. As Roger talked about earlier, we continue to invest in infrastructure and analytic capabilities, which led to an increase in information processing costs. I'll now discuss credit results on slide 9. Total net charge-offs rose 34 basis points from the prior year but are down 14 basis points, sequentially, in line with normal seasonality. Supply-driven credit normalization, along with the seasoning of loan growth from the past few years, continue to be the primary drivers of the year-over-year increase in charge-offs. Credit card net charge-offs rose 34 basis points year-over-year. From a sequential perspective, this quarter represented the fourth consecutive quarter of slowing year-over-year increases in card charge-offs. The credit card 30 plus delinquency rate was up 18 basis points year-over-year, and 16 basis points sequentially. Credit performance in the card business has been very solid. We've also mitigated a degree of future exposure by selectively closing long-term inactive accounts, eliminating nearly $30 billion in contingent risk since the beginning of 2017. Private student loan net charge-offs fell 18 basis points year-over-year, but were up 4 basis points sequentially. Personal loan net charge-offs increased 90 basis points from the prior year, and 12 basis points sequentially. The 30 plus delinquency rate was up 30 basis points year-over-year, and 15 basis points sequentially. There are a number of factors driving personal loan credit performance. First, is the seasoning and normalization phenomena that is also driving losses in Card. This trend continues to develop as we expected. Second, is the loss experience in certain origination channels we started discussing with you in the third quarter of last year. We cut off all origination activities in these sub-segments as soon as the problems became apparent, but the 24-month seasoning curve in personal loans means that the related losses will peak in the next few quarters. This'll drive dollars of charge-off higher until the pig is through the python. Third, I would point out that slowing loan growth will also contribute to higher charge-off rates, because of the denominator effect. And finally, there is a seasonality aspect to our personal loan charge-offs, in that we typically see sequential increases in both the fourth and first quarters. Putting all this together, we would expect to see about a 60, 6-0, basis point increase sequentially in the personal loan charge-off rate, in the fourth quarter, and a full year 2019 charge-off rate of around 5%. Looking at capital on slide 10, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased 20 basis points sequentially, as loan balances grew. Our payout ratio for the last 12 months was 109%. To sum up the quarter on slide 11, we generated 8% total loan growth at a 26% return on equity. Our Consumer Deposit business also posted robust growth at 12%, while deposit rates increased 51 basis points year-over-year. With respect to credit, our total company charge-off rate below 3%, reflects very positive underlying trends in Card and Student Loan. Finally we're continuing to execute on our capital plan with strong loan growth and capital returns helping to bring our capital ratio closer to target levels. In conclusion we're pleased with our performance this quarter, characterized by strong receivables growth, good credit performance, and very strong returns. That concludes our formal remarks, so now I'll turn the call back to our operator, Celisia to open the line for Q&A. Operator : We'll take our first question from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you, and good afternoon. I guess my first question relates to the NIM. It's been fairly stable, all things being equal, and obviously you're ratcheting down the guidance. Mark, could you roll through maybe the puts and takes to what is impacting that outlook for the rest of the year, please. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Sure, absolutely. Ken, I'll just tackle it head-on and say it's a conscious decision on our part. When we had our call last quarter we were looking at a forecast that was at the lower end of our guidance range and we were planning on taking down our level of promotional activity as a percentage of our total balances. And, we made some changes and we saw incredibly strong response rates in economics start flowing through. So, we made a conscious decision that we could either manage to a NIM rate or we could manage to the long-term shareholder value creation by booking business that was demonstrating extremely strong return profiles. We made the decision that we would sacrifice the NIM in the near term to book that good long-term business. So, that's the underlying thought process behind it all, I would say. If you think about it in context quarter over quarter, market rates got you about a 9 basis point good guy for NIM, the funding rate took away about 5 bps, credit with charge-offs of accrued interest being lower added back about 2 bps and then the receivables to rate was about a point or two with promo rates being a little bit higher. So, net, net that gets you 8 basis points sequentially in NIM. And, we continue to be positioned to be modestly asset sensitive. The bigger driver of NIM trajectory's going forward is going to more likely be that mix of promo balances that we now expect to be flat. So we would continue to expect some NIM accretion in the fourth quarter but it will not get us all the way to that prior guidance range. Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. And, firstly, Roger, welcome to the call, and congratulations on your elevated role. I'm interested in kind of a bigger-picture question. Obviously, you mentioned in the prepared remarks the lend-centric model that Discover's been so well-known for. Obviously, you've got a payments business both within the Discover card in a way that is more payments-related and obviously is geared towards transactors. Could you maybe just think, or help us think through, what, how you want to be kind of targeting these different markets? We have juxtapose it with, like, an American Express, who's very transaction-oriented, and has been moving into lending. They think that they have an easy way to pick up balances. You're more of a lend-centric business, and maybe you're trying to pick up transactors. Could you maybe just help us think through that strategic decision that you make. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. Thanks, Ken. I wouldn't confuse our Payments business with a focus on transactors. In fact, the biggest part of our Payments profitability comes from PULSE, which is a Debit business. So, Payments business is really working with third parties, whether they are networks around the world, our Diners Club franchisees or the banks that issue over PULSE. In terms of our card-issuing business, we remain very focused on our lend-centric model. That's something we've had consistently. And, so, while, again, we're seeing great transaction growth and net income growth in Payments, a lot of that is actually driven by the Debit market. Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Maybe I can just, I realize I only have one follow-up. Maybe, within the Discover card, though, you're clearly trying to bring in transactors just through the, effectively, the rewards, the cashback rewards that's more driven towards transactors. But you need to convert those to borrowers to really drive the earnings model. I guess that's really what I was going with. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. We've had rewards since we invented rewards over 30 years ago. So, I wouldn't point to that as a change from our lend-centric model. Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Hey, Sanjay. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hey. Congratulations, Roger. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, Sanjay. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: So, first question, Mark, for you is on the personal loan provisions. Is it fair to assume most of the provisioning related to that pig is behind us? Or should we expect more pressure as it relates to the losses there? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, if you look, our reserve rate was flat quarter-over-quarter, Sanjay. So, what you saw going on over the prior year since we started talking about this, you saw big increases in our reserve rate for the Personal Loan business. Now what you're seeing is those things for which we wrote the reserves starting to migrate through to charge-off. So, you'll still have that normalization phenomena we talked about impacting personal loans. And you'll still have, obviously, whatever happens to the economy between now and then. But that vintage of loans that we've been talking about that was driving reserves is now just blowing through to charge-off. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. My follow-up question, I guess, is for Roger. It's sort of like the second question previously. Maybe you could just talk about how your approach might be different than David's was. I know you guys have seen, generally, eye-to-eye. But maybe you could just talk about any changes, even if nuanced, that you'd propose. Thanks. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. You know, for 14 years, as President, I ran all the operating areas of Discover. So got to drive a lot of the growth, whether it's in the Payments segment, whether it's around our technology strategy or the new features we launched on the Card side. So, I think, really, it's continuing the path we're on. We have a great set of assets. We've been very successful in diversifying our direct banking business from beyond Card, and we're incredibly excited about the growth opportunities we see in the Payments business as well. I'd point to some of the partnerships we're striking with networks around the world. So again, I would not expect any big changes in strategy, but a continued focus around execution, and driving growth. Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good afternoon, guys, and Roger, congrats again. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, Ryan. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Maybe I could start with the promotional activity, Mark, that you talked about keeping at the same level. Could you maybe expand a little bit on what drove the decision to keep it at current levels, particularly what changed over the course of this quarter, relative to your view last quarter to run it down? Are you seeing it more just turning into revolve? You know, what drove the changes over the short-term? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So a couple things. Great question, Ryan. A couple things drove the change to the outlook. First of all, we did reduce the marketing eligible populations. We expected that would result in a response rate that would be lower. What we actually saw is when we reduced those marketing eligible populations and refocused on the remaining populations, we actually saw the response rates go up meaningfully. So the return on the invested dollars ended up being higher than we expected to see it. Number two, I would say, is the engagement we're getting out of these folks. So these aren't just balance transfers; we're talking sales promo as well. So, new account promotional activity as well, right. And we're seeing very strong engagement, actually an uptick in engagement across a number of those different sub-segments relative to what we had seen previously. So, that was a piece of it. And then, I had mentioned the FICO score has actually migrated north. It's actually, the FICO score that we're getting in these accounts right now is actually well north of the portfolio FICO for the card accounts, and the marginal ROEs actually ticked up meaningfully from what we've been seeing. So when you put that all in the blender and hit go, we really sat down and said, okay, again, we can manage to a NIM rate, because we're not insensitive to when we give you guys guidance, obviously. By the same token, managing to the NIM rate would have been walking away from fabulous business that's going to be really accretive to shareholder value over time. So, we made what we thought was the right decision. So that was kind of the facts and the thought process. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks for all the color on that, and maybe there's a question for Roger. Roger, we're hearing a lot of your competitors talking about accelerating marketing, American Express, Capital One talked about it on their call last night. And I just wanted to get your view on the competitive intensity in the card market. You guys have talked about loan growth slowing, pulling back from various channels, and just wanted to get your sense for the overall competitive landscape, given that, obviously with given where the stocks are trading on P/E, the market's obviously concerned that there could be a downturn at some point in the not-so-distant future. So, any color you have there would be appreciated. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, I think, first, the comments on loan growth slowing and pulling back from certain channels are really about the personal loan business. New accounts are up strongly on the card side. We're seeing great productivity on our new account investments, so even with significantly more new accounts, cost per account is down. My view is the card business is always competitive. There might have been a lull in 2008-2009, but the key is putting a great value proposition out there. We continue to differentiate in terms of customer experience, and the functionality we provide. So, again, we feel very good about the growth we're putting up, and we're continuing to invest in driving that growth. Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes, I had a question about card delinquency rate, 30-plus day. I was curious, it's been relatively stable on a year-over-year basis, arguably has been a tiny bit elevated more recently. I was just curious how you see that trend playing out. Do we stay steady, or do we have a bias to the upside because of growth math? And then also, Mark, on the reserve bill, you've been sort of hanging out in this $100 million range. How do you think about that on a going forward basis, you know, just directionally? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So in terms of the delinquency rate and the charge-offs, it was the fourth consecutive quarter, Don, where we've see a slowdown in the rate of increase in charge-off formation. So I think that migration has stopped. Delinquencies, I agree, have, they came down from call it 37 middle of last year plus or minus the increase, 37 basis points to more or less flat at about 16, 18 basis points, something like that over the course of the last few quarters. So, they are down meaningfully. I think one of the big drivers is the growth map piece. Right? As Roger mentioned, we had very strong growth in new accounts. We continue to target new card members selectively in this environment. We think the window for growth remains open with the current macro backdrop. So, if you think about the reserve piece as opposed to delinquency piece for a second, roughly, call it 35%, 40% of what you see for reserving is new account related, with the remainder being more season back book related. Right? So, in that context, you do have a big chunk of it that is being driven by the growth map, to use my competitors' terminology. So, but we think it's manageable. We feel very good about where it is, and we love the economics. In terms of the overall reserve build at the roughly $99 million, the bulk of that was related to card and really reflects what we see coming at us in that seasoning and in those pieces of the puzzle. It's down, the card reserve build is down, call it $20 million, over the same quarter last year despite generating a bigger amount of new accounts. That probably tells you something about the quality of the accounts and what we expect to see going on there. So, it continues to feel like we're booking really high-end, high-quality business right now. And I feel good about what we're putting on the books. Reserve rate going forward is also going to be impacted by macroeconomic factors and everything else, so I don't want to prognosticate other than to say we like what we're putting on the books. Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. I have a question about loan growth, maybe for Mark. Is the implication and the commentary around NIM and the decision to do more of the promotional balances than you originally thought, is part of the implication that maybe loan growth comes in at the higher end or above the higher end of expectations? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So, I think, if you think about it in terms of our guidance range for the full year for total loans of 7% to 9%, I certainly think you would come in north of the midpoint of that range as we sit here right now, I think that's a reasonable expectation. I think one of the things we're encouraged by, again, is not just the level of growth we're seeing, but, again, I'll reemphasize the quality of that growth, the FICO profile that's coming in from this incremental business that we have elected not to run off because of what we've seen since making some of those changes, or not to run down, since making some of those changes I alluded to earlier. Feel good not just about the level of growth but of the quality of the growth we're finding right now. And to Roger's point earlier, as well, cost-effective acquisition of these accounts right now. Marketing expenses are up, but cost per account are down. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then for my follow-up. I think, during the quarter, we heard a lot of incremental commentary from other players in the personal loan space that they were seeing credit, at least from loans purchased from some of the marketplace lenders, it was coming in worse than expected, economics that were looking worse. Did you see anything during the quarter that made you incrementally more concerned and maybe has you close to the guidance of being down year-over-year versus potentially flat? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : No, I mean, I think we haven't really seen anything new over the course of the last, since we spoke to you last in terms of the development there. We did start pulling back a full year ago. It was the third quarter of last year when we really started talking to you about what we started seeing in some of these segments. So, I think in Consumer Lending, you've got to have very, you've got to have continuous monitoring, and you've got to have tollgates set up for if you see certain things start to happen, they need to drive actions. So, I think we probably saw some of that start to emerge early and took action relatively more quickly, but there's no question, as we've said before, just the pile-on effect of every day you open your financial press and there's somebody else talking about entering the Personal Loan space. We've said all along, there's a time when you want to get on the accelerator in this business and a time when it makes more sense to, there's still a window of opportunity for personal loan growth. It's just nowhere near as wide as it once was, and you've got to be more selective. Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great, thanks. I was sort of wondering, given your comments about continued strong balance growth, but improving quality, could you kind of put that into context of, this sort of was addressed partially in a previous question. But when you think about the reserve needs for that portfolio, again, keeping the economy constant was we go into 2019, how should we think about that for the Card business? Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : So, one of the big swing factors in an actuarial portfolio, as you know, Moshe, is the macro factors. So, if you control for those and, say, hold all the macro factors exactly constant, right? It would really be more a function of just how much of the book is going through seasoning at that point in time. So, it would be what percentage of the book is new accounts would be the driver. And then, the second piece would be what is going on with consumer leverage out there more broadly. So, what's happening to loss severities, given a default. Those would really become the two swing factors that would drive that. We have seen consumers re-approach that normalized level of leverage. It's kind of what we believe is part of what's driving this normalization in losses beginning to slow. Right? The normalization and charge-offs beginning to approach some type of a normalized rate. So, I would say based on what we see now we don't see over-leveraging being something that I would say driving it right now. But that could change tomorrow, just to be clear. But we don't see it right now. So, I would say, going forward, those reserves are going to be far more affected by what percentage of the book is new accounts at that point in time would really be the swing factor if you neuter all the macro economic effects. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, thanks. And maybe a second question. I'm very impressed with the declining acquisition costs. And you've alluded to it before, but it seems like it's a more significant factor now. And I guess I'm trying to understand just given that this is a continued competitive industry, and you do see large upfront bonuses that many issuers are offering, like, what would you attribute that to and anything you can kind of tell us about the persistence of your revenue streams post promo pricing and how that's faring in this environment. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. So, in terms of new account pricing and promotions, we've tried to steer away from those kind of big-ticket $300, $500. We do double the cashback bonus for the first year and have found that to work very, very well and don't see a significant decline in spending once that promotional period expires because it's really driving long-term usage over an entire year. A lot of the benefits in terms of cost per account come from product differentiation, customer experience differentiation and just the strength of the brand. So, by leveraging our proprietary network, the advertising we have is working well, and then some of the investments we've been making around analytics. And so, optimizing, whether it's direct mail, whether it's the digital channels, optimizing conversion rate, those are really paying off and letting us achieve those lower-cost per account even as we book more accounts and have been tightening our credit box. Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Let me just add my congratulations, Roger. Thanks. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Hi. Thanks a lot, Moshe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks very much, and I'll add my congratulations as well. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, Eric. Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC : Just to follow up on some of these topics, the efficacy of the marketing spend, as you've talked about, is very apparent, and the flat level of marketing dollars spent. And yet growth remains very robust. But, I guess, then, like, is the offset in the income statement therefore coming primarily from the rewards rate in terms of where the cost of this promotional activity is being captured? Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : To some degree, I would say, Eric, that's a fair statement. So, we, kind of think of marketing dollars and rewards to some degree as flip-sides of the same coin. So, either way, you're trying to attract and engage customers to engage with the brand, right. So, sometimes that's more effectively done via marketing dollars, sometimes more effectively done via rewards. Last quarter, rewards were a big driver not only on the doubles promotion on the new accounts, if you hold the sales promo piece that we saw, but also our 5% rotating cashback category that we do. Last quarter it was restaurants, and we saw the highest level of engagement with the 5% rotating category we have ever seen in our history. So I think, yes, we are targeting in on some of those rewards pieces of the puzzle as a trade-off. But even if you think about it that way, rewards rate year-over-year increase is pretty darned modest, and you look at the growth into accounts we're getting, as well as the growth in balances from existing card members, I think the marketing team has done a great job dialing in getting that mix right, and really kind of driving great new account acquisition. Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you for that, and Mark, if I can just follow up on one other expense line item, which is the information processing. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yep. Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC : What are the analytical capabilities that you guys are investing in, and is a function, and what's motivating that? Is it a perceived lack of capability relative to peers, or what's driving that investment at this stage? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : So a portion of it is directly related to where that development is taking place. Historically, when you did legacy development for in-house systems, the development cost was capitalized. Today, we are pivoting much more into the Cloud, and a lot of the development work in the Cloud gets expensed. So that is a big piece of the driver of what's going on. In terms of exactly where we're investing, I'll kick it over to my partner Roger here to give you his thoughts on that one. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, I'd start by saying it's not driven by a feeling that we're lagging behind our peers, it's being driven by the opportunities we see, truly, over a multi-year horizon. If you look at the tremendous changes that are going on, and I hate throwing around the term, sort of, big data or machine learning, but you are seeing fundamental changes in the power of analytics. And if you think about everything that is model-driven in our environment, whether it's fraud, whether it's credit, whether it's marketing, and the ability of sort of next-generation models and technologies to drive significant results, let alone sort of automation, whether it's in the call centers or robotic process automation, those are some of the investments we're making and, again, we believe this will be a multi-year journey. Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Buckingham. Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question, congratulations. Want to talk about the brand campaign for a little bit. The advertising budget's been relatively flat, it looks like, from our perspective, but still see relatively high levels of advertising on TV. I'm just wondering if you can measure or discuss at all the lift you're getting from that brandings. The numbers look, consistently, getting share. You mentioned the positive trends you're seeing in the portfolio. How much can you attribute that to the brand, and then, on a related question, when are we going to see advertising as a cash back checking product? That seems like a no-brainer as a pretty successful product. Thanks. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, so, in terms of overall advertising, I think cross-channel attribution over a complex consumer decision journey, such as getting a credit card, is one of the biggest challenges in marketing. We've been investing heavily in that area as well, and the ability to track, sort of, where customers see our advertising, and what drove them to apply for a card. Some of that is proprietary, but the team in marketing does a great job in terms of making sure that we are getting value for our advertising, both in terms of how it drives decisions, but also rotating the placements we have. And so there's been a lot more science than, I think, in prior years, as people look at advertising. In terms of the checking product, we are very excited about that. We have been disciplined in terms of ramping it up, just to make sure that we provide the same great customer experience in that product as we do across all of our others. We have some actual radio spots that are in market now, and we're seeing those drive higher search activity. So while it will take some time for this to become a meaningful part of our funding, we're very excited about the product, the differentiation it has, and our ability to grow it. Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great, thanks. And, one quick follow-up on the personal loan trajectory. It seems like the fiscal increase in the fourth quarter seems relatively normal and 50 basis points sounds reasonable, or I think a little higher than that, actually, in our model. The 5% for next year is a little higher than I was thinking, and just wondering, can you talk about the seasoning curve, when would that peak in 2019? Towards the first half of the year, hopefully? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, I think that's a reasonable way to model it. At the end of the day, a big driver next year is going to be that denominator effect piece of the puzzle as well, right. So, otherwise, you would see it fall on a stable portfolio, or if you were originating just enough to keep the portfolio flat, you would see it come down a little bit from that 5% level. So, I think the denominator effect will be a piece of it. Chris Brendler - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: (44:00) Thank you so much. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache from Nomura. Bill Carcache - Nomura Instinet : Thank you. First question I wanted to ask is on, Mark, I wanted to follow up on your reserve commentary. We see that the year-over-year growth in your loan loss reserves has been slowing since the third quarter of 2017, and it looks like it's on a path to converging with your loan growth. And it also looks like the year-over-year change in your reserve rate peaked in the third quarter at around 40 basis points, and it's been on a downward trajectory since. So two- part question : first part is, is it reasonable to expect that these trajectories will continue? And then the second part is, if we are indeed, you know, approaching a point where credit headwinds are abating, and these trends hold, and you sustain your industry-leading loan growth and revenue growth, then is it reasonable to conclude that that's going to translate into incremental positive operating leverage, or would you guys reinvest some of that in the business? Just some color around those points would be great. And congratulations, Roger. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : There's a whole bunch. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, Bill. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : There's a whole bunch in there, I'm going to try to hit on all of it. Feel free to use your follow-up, to the extent I missed something. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : He already did. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : I think at the end of the day, in response to your first question about the declining rate of increase in the reserve growth, yeah, I think that is directly reflective of the trends we're seeing, as we're approaching that normalized level of losses. So I kind of think about it a little bit like that old calculus class that used to drive me crazy with limit calculations. You just kind of turn it on its side, and your limit curve is approaching the asymptote, and so as that's happening, charge-offs are normalizing, and you're seeing the impact reserve built in the card account, in the card portfolio normalized as well. So I think that's a reasonable way to think about it. The one thing I would remind you, or the couple things I'd remind you in that context is, it will be affected by relative growth rates in loan balances as well, right? So if we get a disproportionate amount of new accounts, or a disproportionate amount of loan balances coming from things that are less seasoned, that would obviously have bearing and could cause hiccups in that and everything. But I think, as a general rule, you're thinking about it the right way. In terms of operating leverage, in terms of how to think about that, I would pick up on Roger's earlier commentary. Well, first of all, I would say we are very committed as a company to positive operating leverage, so let's put that out there. There is a lot of leverage in the model that we perhaps aren't fully availing ourselves of right now, because we are investing very heavily in that digital and analytics side of the equation that we spoke of, and we're also taking advantage of originating quality accounts while the market is ripe for us to do so. So, I think there's more leverage that exists in the model when we choose to pull those levers. Right now, the levers we're choosing to pull are the investments in the digital and technology investments, because we're seeing tremendous payback on those. Bill Carcache - Nomura Instinet : Thank you. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Absolutely. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks guys, for taking my questions. Roger, congratulations. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, Rick. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Collectively, we've spent a lot of time over the last year thinking about the profile, the timeline and profile for a cohort of profitability, thinking about growing that cohort, reserving for it, experiencing the losses. You guys are focused now, in part, on growing the portfolio through some promotional balances. I'm curious as we've spent so much time refining our thought process on what that profile looks like, if it will be different, if it's delayed for balances to grow through promotional balances in terms of profitability. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : So I would say it's going to, Rick, depend to some degree on what type of promotional balance you're talking about. Sales promos I would say no, right? So if you're doubling the rewards in the first year for a new card member, those type things, I would say no, those aren't going to have delaying effects and mitigating effects and all those things. Balance transfers, the answer is, it depends on the nature of that balance transfer. If you do a $5,000-line assignment, and somebody transfers $4,995 over the day you do the line assignment, you probably made a mistake. You're probably dealing with somebody who doesn't have incremental borrowing capacity. And you're dealing with a surfer, and so you try and minimize for that to the greatest extent you can under, obviously, fair credit laws, which you're going to comply with at all cost, obviously. So, I'd say that's a piece of the puzzle. The other balance transfers, the more normalized balance transfers, I would say no. There might be a delay by a couple of months but not anything that's dramatically significant or that I would say would affect your modeling in a huge way. Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Yep. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair : Thank you, and Roger, congratulations on outlasting David. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Thanks, Bob. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair : The one thing, Roger, that you sounded a little more incrementally excited about for Discover is the growth of the payments business. That did have very nice growth, and there's probably nothing that could help your valuation multiple more than if that became a bigger piece of the pie. And it seems like a significant opportunity to do that with the network that you have. Is there an expectation or a focus incrementally that, on that payments business, on having it become a bigger part of the pie? And would you look at acquisitions? And I know they're expensive in the payment space, but I think even a short-term dilutive, long-term accretive acquisition probably would be well received. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. If you think about payments as a percent of total earnings, we would never slow down the earnings growth on the direct banking side. And you can see, while earnings are growing nicely on the payment side of the business, we're also focused on driving loan growth and growth in profitability on the Direct Banking side, too. Some of our biggest acquisitions have been on the payment side. So, if you look at PULSE that got us into the debit business, if you look at Diners Club that brought us global acceptance around the world. Both of those were transformational. You know, traditionally we have not done huge-scale acquisitions. So may look at bolt-ons or things that add capabilities. I would echo your comment around valuations on the payment side, but growing that business is a big part of our strategy. We have a unique set of assets. We're really excited about some of the partnerships we have, whether it's working with PayPal, or with Apple, or with networks all around the world. So, it is a key focus of ours. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair : Thank you. My follow-up question, just, on the Student Loan business, there've been a couple businesses, like SoFi or maybe Navient, focusing very aggressively on refinancing the highest-quality borrowers within that portfolio. Is that, are you seeing incremental, an increase in the loan payoff? And is that something that concerns you about being able to grow that business longer-term? Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Yeah. So, we are seeing pressure on payment rates from student loan consolidators, and that's having an impact on our loan growth. I wouldn't say it's necessarily impacting charge-offs as much, but really the impact is on the loan growth. We've still been growing at 10% year-over-year. We expect another record year of originations. So, I'd say it's something we're monitoring. It'll be interesting to see how those consolidators do in a rising rate environment, given the amount of fixed rate loans that are out there. So, I'd say something we're watching, we are seeing an impact, but nothing that's changing our overall strategic view on the Student Loan business. Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair : Right. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good evening. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Hey, Betsy. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Hey, Betsy. Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Congratulations, Roger. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Thanks. Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just a couple of follow-ups. One, on the NIM outlook, I know that you talked about earlier on the call at the coming in for the full year below the range of 10.3% to 10.4%. Could you just give us a sense as to, that's ever so slightly modestly below because it feels to me like it would be hard to go south of 10.2%, but maybe I'm wrong on that. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, no, no, you'll see accretion in the fourth quarter from the third quarter's level, and the way you're describing it is by far away the right way to think about it, Betsy. It's not going to, you know, we're talking a handful of basis points. We're not talking about below the guidance range, we're not talking a precipitous decline here. Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. All right, thanks. And then, separately, just want to get a little bit of a sense from you on how you think your customers are doing, you know, financially. You know, obviously good loan growth year-to-date, and expecting to continue to have loan growth. So I want to understand, because I know you see your customers' full picture, or pretty close to their full financial picture. Do you see them having a lot more capacity to add on leverage? Do you see them taking the leverage that you provide them with, and, you know, paying down other parts of the stack? And how do you see their cash flows? Maybe give us some color on that. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, so, you know, clearly it's a very robust economic environment. If you look at unemployment, if you look at wage growth starting to come into the marketplace. So given the breadth of our book, that's benefiting our customers as well. In terms of whether that opens up a huge amount of capacity, you know, we've been pretty clear that we've been tightening the credit box over the last couple years, and don't really plan on shifting that focus at this point, given how late we are in the cycle. But, again, we feel good about where our customers are, and that's showing up in the numbers. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, and I would pile on to that, Betsy, and just kind of say one of the things that we watch very closely is obviously not just the overall level of leverage, but as we're also in a rising rate environment, what is the cost of that leverage, right? And one of the things that's somewhat encouraging or maybe, you know, less troubling about the re-levering in the consumer, might be a better way to say it, is the vast majority of that incremental leverage they've put on has been fixed rate. So, unlike going into the crisis when everybody had a giant ARM and when rates started to rise, payments exploded, here, it's principally auto loans, student loans, and personal loans that have driven the bulk of the increase in the leverage since the low point, and all of those that have the combination, could be characteristic of largely being fixed-rate in nature. So while leverage is back to normalized leverage, the rate-carrying implications that are a little better than historically we have seen them. Keeping an eye on it, watching it like a hawk, but right now it feels manageable. Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, and then, just lastly, CECL, we haven't talked much about that, and I think parallel run starts next year. Is there anything that you would be able to do with regard to the reserve ratio to prepare for that? Or do you just have to wait until 1Q 2020? Maybe give us some color and updates on how you're thinking about that. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, the only way we could do anything would be to early adopt, Betsy, and we are still working through all the modeling activity that we need to be digging through to get ready to implement the standard. We do intend to do parallel runs, we do intend to, at some point next year, start giving you guy's transparency into what we're looking at. Our clear hope at the end of the day is, there has been a growing drumbeat across multiple different industry groups, across many different people for a delay and study approach to CECL. We think there are a number of different quantitative impacts here that just haven't been fully considered. You know, the interaction between CCAR and CECL, or whatever the stress testing for the mid-tiers like ourself is going to be, and CECL, how does that interact? The impact on, you know, the provision of loans into the economy. There's a pro-cyclical element of this sucker that you're going to pull back on extending credit at the beginning of downturns, right, when folks want banks to lend, right? From an SEC standpoint, there's going to be comparability challenges in terms of how you think about, you know, if in our card assumptions, we assume a short, shallow recession two years from now, and Brand X assumes a long, deep recession in 15 months, I don't know how you're going to compare our reserve thoughts to their reserve thoughts, and figure that out. So I really think delay and study is the right answer. We have commented on that, and to the extent those of you on the call think that would make sense as well, we would encourage you to join us and sign on. Betsy L. Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I would definitely like to study more. So, no, that's helpful. Appreciate the thoughts there, Mark. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Absolutely. My pleasure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Would also like to add my congratulations to Roger and then I'll turn and pivot and ask Mark a question from your February 2014 Investor Day just for fun. So, Mark. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Hopefully I remember it, but go ahead, fire away. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Yeah, exactly yeah. What I figured I would ask is just on the Personal Loan business because I think that was the last time you gave us some disclosure on sort of the complexion of those loans, the average FICA was 750, typical term was three to five years and then 60% of that portfolio had a separate Discover relationship. I was just wondering if in recent years if it still looked pretty much the same particularly on that Discover relationship being the majority of the portfolio for personal loans. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, so it's about 60% of the portfolio still cross sold has a relationship with the, on the credit card side with us as well. The average FICA was right around that 750 level still, so no meaningful upward or downward drift in FICO. In terms of term, the average life we're seeing right now is about two years. We offer three to seven but the average life is running about two years give or take. So I would say on a, actually, and the average life is like 1.8 years, but round it and call it two. So at the end of the day I would say no significant drift in the composition of the portfolio at this point in time broadly. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Got it, and then another history question for you. I apologize. But just a mix of promotional balances, is that around 19%? That's what it was about a year ago. Just wondering if it's still in that sort of ZIP code. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : No, it's up about 1% over the course of the last year, give or take in terms of where it's sitting today. Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Got it. Okay, that makes sense to me. Thanks, Mark. Operator : Our next question comes from Jill Shea with Citi. Jill Shea - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, good evening. Just on the credit quality side on the card side and the slowing year-over-year growth in net charge offs, could you walk us through the dynamics that you're seeing in the front book versus the back book loss curve? And then could you also provide some color on the performance of the front book vintage years and how they're performing relative to each other? R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : Yeah, we don't provide vintage year disclosure so I'll stay away from that one. What I can say is, if you think about the reserve bill this quarter, Jill, roughly give or take about half of it was result of seasoning of new loan growth and roughly half of it was due to that normalization phenomena with increasing severity as customers have carried more leverage. So that's about what's driving the reserving phenomena and obviously reserving expects what we, is kind of the driver really of kind of what we expect to see coming at us in the future. So that probably gives you a little bit of sense of how we're thinking about that. And in terms of the composition then of where we're seeing some of this come from in a different lens, I'd say, roughly let's call it 40% is new account related, two-thirds of the total is back book-related. Now those Venn diagrams aren't mutually exclusive. There's some overlap in there, so don't look at them both, because some of the back book is new loan balances and so there's different pieces of the puzzle there. But I think that probably gives you a pretty good way to think about it. Jill Shea - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks, very helpful. R. Mark Graf - Discover Financial Services : You bet. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Bill Ryan with Compass Point. William Ryan - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC : Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Just to follow up on the promotional balances, last quarter, I think you disclosed it was about 21% of the card book. If you looked a year ago, roughly what was the percentage of promo balances and if you looked at Discover's card book over a long-term period, roughly what percentage of the card book is typically on a type of a promo balance? And second part of that question, I mean, you've been running the double cashback promo for quite a while. Is there any incremental types of promo programs that you're running at this point? Thanks again. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : You bet. So a couple different parts of that. So the promo rates are up 1% over a year ago, so that call it 21%ish number is still the right way to think about it. They were more like 20% a year ago, give or take. Rough math in both cases. We kind of expect to see them flat. As I mentioned on my prepared remarks, we don't expect to see them tick up from here, so we'd expect that even though we're remaining more active in some of these segments than we initially thought we might be that mix will stay flat as far as that goes. In terms of thinking about how that level has varied over time I would say it tends to vary pretty dramatically. As you might imagine, when you see a downturn coming when you're in the middle of a downturn, you don't do a lot of promo activity so that balance falls off pretty meaningfully. When you're at a point in time in the cycle where you see great opportunities to acquire accounts and engage accounts via promotional activity; that tends to tick up. So, we are toward the higher end if you look at the ranges that we've run at from time. We're not at the absolute high, but we're toward, up toward the more upper end of that as opposed to the lower end, given the nature of the environment we're in right now. In terms of the doubles, I would say, no, double continues to be the significant sales promo we're running. We do run other things from time to time. But the real driver of the numbers is going to be the doubles on the sales promotion side, and it's going to be the BT activity as well. William Ryan - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC : Thank you. Roger C. Hochschild - Discover Financial Services : Absolutely. My pleasure. Craig Streem - Discover Financial Services : Celisia, we're good. So, thank you, everybody, for your questions, your interest. And you know how to find us for any follow-ups. Thanks.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Cilicia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter 2018 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Craig Streem : Thank you, Cilicia. Welcome, everyone to our call this afternoon. I'll begin on slide two of the presentation, which you can find in the Financial section of our Investor Relations website. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8K report and in our 10-K and third quarter 2018 Q, which are on our website and on file with the SEC. In the fourth quarter 2018 earnings materials, we've provided information that compares and reconciles our non-GAAP financial measures with GAAP financial information, and we explain why these measures are useful to management and investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Our call today will include remarks from our Chief Executive Officer, Roger Hochschild, covering fourth quarter and full year highlights and developments. And then, Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the rest of the presentation. And after Mark completes his comments, as Cilicia said, we will have time for Q&A sessions and we would ask of course that you hold your Q&As to one with one follow-up so that we have time for everyone to submit their questions. So, thank you. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, Craig and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. With this being our year-end call I want to begin by reviewing full year highlights and key performance indicators on slide three, then turn the call over to Mark to review fourth quarter results. Later in the call we'll cover our guidance elements for 2019. We earned $2.7 billion after tax or $7.79 per share in 2018. Generating a return on equity of 25%, as we put our capital to work to grow the business and repurchase our shares. Once again we generated a very strong return on equity, reflecting our unique combination of businesses across consumer lending and payments, as well as strong operating performance. Our performance in 2018 reflected robust receivables and revenue growth, particularly in the card business. We continue to invest in brand advertising, in marketing analytics and in superior service. And together these investments continue to drive profitable growth and of course we remain focused on providing an exceptional customer experience and are proud to have won the J.D. Power Award for credit card customer satisfaction in 2018. On the subject of how we treat our customers, I want to take a minute to acknowledge the difficult financial situation now faced by furloughed government employees. To support customers in that situation, we are providing payment holidays to those that ask for flexibility at this time. Overall credit performance continues to stabilize. The impact of normalization is diminishing and we are experiencing tangible benefits from enhancements to our underwriting and collection strategies. Our payment services segment generated strong volume gains, up 15% in 2018 largely due to the performance of PULSE. The PULSE team has been successful at winning new relationships and building business with existing issuers by developing creative debit solutions that deliver meaningful value for partners. Finally, I want to emphasize the importance of investing in our global acceptance footprint and technology. These are two distinct areas that both are critical to our ongoing success. In terms of global acceptance, we continue to see a great opportunity to partner with local acquirers to enhance merchant acceptance. We made significant progress on this in the fourth quarter signing a number of agreements in a variety of markets including the UK and Continental Europe. Universal merchant acceptance remains an important objective as we pursue our longer term vision of being a leading global payments partner. And in terms of technology spend, we are continuing to invest in initiatives to drive even better customer experience and competitive advantage. For example, we're making ongoing investments in machine learning to enable faster and better decisions about how to target our collection strategies and marketing campaigns. We've begun to see the benefits of these investments in 2018, with positive impacts on loan growth and credit performance. Now turning to slide four. We are pleased to generate strong total loan growth for the year of 7% with card receivables up 8%. I alluded to this a moment ago and talking about machine learning, but I am particularly pleased with our growth in new card accounts even as we continue to tighten credit and brought down the average acquisition costs per account. Student lending turned in another great year with organic receivables up 9% and record originations of $1.8 billion. Our personal loan portfolio grew 1% in 2018 as we cut back on origination activity by tightening underwriting standards. Competitive intensity remains high with new entrance continuing to ramp up originations. We will maintain our traditional underwriting discipline, as we focus on driving growth that meets our return objectives. Turning to slide five, credit continues to perform in line with our expectations with seasoning of recent growth and normalization being the key drivers. We will have more to say about the overall credit environment when we discuss fourth quarter performance in 2019 later in the call. But as we enter 2019 we feel very good about underlying trends. I\u2019ll now ask Mark to discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark Graf : Thanks, Roger and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide six. Looking at key elements of the income statement, revenue growth 7% this quarter was driven by strong loan growth and a slightly higher net interest margin. Provision for loan loss has increased due to the combination of the seasoning of loan growth and ongoing supply driven normalization in the consumer credit industry. Operating expenses rose 7% year-over-year, as a result of investments in support of growth and new capabilities. This includes the higher level of incentive payments made in support of the global merchant acceptance initiatives that Roger talked about earlier. Turning to slide seven, total loans increased 7% over the prior year, led by 8% growth in credit card receivables. Growth in standard merchandise balances drove much of this increase, with a lesser contribution from promotional balances. We currently expect the promotional balance mix to decline modestly in 2019 and for standard merchandise balances to continue to be the primary engine for growth in card. Moving to the results from our Payment segment, on the right hand side of slide seven, you can see that proprietary volume rose 6% year-over-year. In Payment Services, PULSE continues to drive the lion share of both volume and growth, with volume up 11% compared to the prior year. Growth was driven by both new issuers as well as incremental volume from existing issuers. Moving to revenue on slide eight, net interest income increased $182 million or 9% from a year ago driven by higher loan balances and modest NIM expansion. Total non-interest income grew 11%, primarily from a 13% increase in loan fee income. Sales volume grew by 5% driven principally by growth in active card members. Adjusted for the number of processing days, sales growth would have been 6%, which is down from 9% on a day adjusted basis last quarter. Our rewards rate for the fourth quarter was 128 basis points, up 5 basis points year-over-year. This increase is due to both portfolio mix, which continues to shift toward the Discover It product with its slightly higher average rewards rate, as well as our decision to feature warehouse clubs in the 5% category in the fourth quarter. As shown on slide nine, our net interest margin was 10.35% for the quarter, up 7 basis points on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. Relative to the fourth quarter of the prior year, the benefit of a higher prime rate and the expiration of the FDIC surcharge were offset by the impact of an increase in promotional balances, higher deposit costs and higher interest charge offs. Relative to the third quarter, the increase in net interest margin reflected a higher prime rate, the expiration of the FDIC surcharge and a mix shift in our liquidity portfolio from cash to investment securities. Total loan yield increased 45 basis points from a year ago to 12.59%, primarily driven by a 41 basis points increase in card yield. Prime rate increases and a modest increase in the revolve rate led card yield higher, partially offset by a mix -- higher mix of promotional balances and higher charge-offs. On the liability side of the balance sheet, consumer deposits grew 12% as we continue to focus on more stable and cost effective sources of funding. Consumer deposit rates rose during the quarter increasing 12 basis points sequentially and 56 basis points year-over-year. deposit betas have increased, though cumulative betas continue to be better than historic norms. Turning to slide 10, operating expenses rose $74 million from their prior year, other expenses were up $40 million, with almost $35 million of the increase due to the investments in global merchant acceptance, which Roger spoke about earlier and had previewed at the Goldman Conference in December. These were driven by agreements that we signed with new partners as well as existing partners in new territories. In some cases, acceptance milestones were achieved more quickly than anticipated and that contributed to the higher level of incentive payments in the fourth quarter. In marketing, expenses were up as a result of greater brand and digital advertising activity. Finally, our ongoing investments in infrastructure and analytic capabilities accounted for the increase in information processing costs. I'll now discuss credit results on slide 11, total net charge offs rose 23 basis points from the prior year. The seasoning of loan growth from the past few years and supply driven credit normalization continue to be the primary drivers of the year-over-year increase in charge-offs. Credit Card net charge-offs rose 20 basis points year-over-year. From a sequential perspective this quarter represented the fifth consecutive quarter of slowing year-over-year increases encourage charge-offs. The credit card 30 plus delinquency rate was up 15 basis points year-over-year and 11 basis points sequentially. Our disciplined approach to managing credit with both new and existing accounts has led to continued solid credit performance in the card business. Private student loan credit performance has also been very strong, with net charge-offs down 17 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points sequentially. Personal loan net charge-offs were up 87 basis points from the prior year and 40 basis points sequentially, slightly better than the 50 to 60 basis points we'd expected. The 30 plus delinquency rate was up 20 basis points year-over-year and 3 basis points sequentially. Looking at Capital on slide 12, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased 30 basis points sequentially as loan balances grew. Our payout ratio for the last 12 months was 93%. To sum up the quarter on slide 13, we generated 7% total loan growth and a 25% return on equity. Our consumer deposits business also posted robust growth or 12%, while deposit rates increased 56 basis points year-over-year. With respect to credit, our total company charge-off rate just over 3% reflects positive underlying trends in card and student loans. And finally, we're continuing to execute on our capital plan and strong loan growth and capital returns helping to bring our capital ratio closer to target levels. Turning to slide 14, I want to shift gears and review the key factors that we believe we'll contribute to another year of strong returns even as we continue to invest for a longer term growth. First, our base case for 2019 adopts the consensus view that macroeconomic conditions remain stable. Although our growth plan does contemplate a degree of tightening of the margin, the economy is growing. Of particular importance to us as a consumer lender, employment and wages are growing, and consumer leverage remains manageable. Very simply, we don't see any indication in the data of a turn in the credit cycle. Second, Discover has a very strong and widely recognized brand, which consumers associate with value, trust and exceptional customer service, particularly in card. These attributes remain core to driving profitable growth and we will continue to invest in brand awareness for our other consumer banking products as well. Third, we will continue to invest in technology, supporting the deployment of advanced analytics and automation. This will allow us to make better, faster decisions drive operational efficiencies in account acquisition, servicing, fraud and collections. And of course, the threat that weaves leaves all this together is our relentless focus on customer experience. We recognize that we live in a highly competitive environment, but we've been able to distinguish ourselves by introducing features and benefit that customers\u2019 value. Our customer centric approach has been fundamental to our consistently strong growth and returns. With that, let's move on to 2019 guidance on slide 15. As I said a moment ago, our base assumption for 2019 is a continuation of the current economic environment. If this proves to be wrong and we see meaningful deterioration in macro-economic conditions, we would, in all likelihood, pull back on growth and experience an increase in charge-offs. Of course, we would also have flexibility in managing rewards costs and operating expenses, which would provide a degree of mitigation. Looking at the specific guidance elements. First, we've established a loan growth target range of 6% to 8% based on opportunities that we believe will allow us to continue driving discipline profitable loan growth. Moving to expenses, we expect operating expenses to be in a range of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion. This reflects higher base levels of expenses to support growth in the business, as well as continuing investments in the initiatives that Roger and I have mentioned. With respect to rewards, we expect the rate to come in between 132 and 134 basis points for 2019, a modest increase, largely resulting from the ongoing shift in product mix, as we originate all of our new card accounts on the Discover It platform, which has a slightly higher average rewards rates than the predecessor product. Moving to our outlook for net interest margin, we expect the full year NIM to come in around 10.3%, with a bias to the upside. The prime rate increases from last year will contribute positively to NIM in 2019. We also anticipate a modest NIM benefit from a lower mix of promotional balances. Potentially offsetting these benefits would be deposit pricing pressure, wider wholesale funding spreads and modestly higher interest charge-offs. In terms of credit costs, we expect the total net charge-off rate this year to be in a range of 3.2% to 3.4%. As a result of the seasoning of a growing portfolio as well as continued though moderating supply driven credit normalization. So to sum things up, we're pleased with our performance in 2018 and look forward to continued momentum in the year ahead. One final comment. Earlier today we announced internally that Noelle Whitehead will be assuming a leadership role in our student lending business. I want to take this opportunity to thank her publicly for her outstanding service as a member of the Investor Relations team over the last several years. That concludes our formal remarks, so I'll turn the call back to our operator Cilicia to open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Yes, thanks. I think you had indicated last quarter that you saw better than expected growth in promotional balances impart due to some more effective marketing on your end. Could you just talk about whether that trend kind of held this past quarter? And what\u2019s your outlook is for that into 2019 and what if any impact it may have on your NIM guidance? Mark Graf : Sure Mark, happy to tackle it. We did continue to see promotional growth play a role in our -- in the growth in our card book over the course of the quarter. But it was a secondary level of growth and it was a distant secondary level of growth the standard merchandise purchases. So I would say, we saw a moderation in the component of the growth that was represented by promotional balances. As we think about looking into 2019, we would continue to see the proportion of growth represented by promotional balances continue to decline modestly. So in terms of NIM guidance that's what's kind of baked in there, thought through there. I think in terms of the 10.3% with a bias to the upside on the NIM thought just generally that guidance doesn't include any increases in rates by the Fed. Any short-term rate increases it's following the forward curve instead of the dot lots. So that would be also be a little bit of upside to margin if we were to get some of that probably to the tune of about 4 to 6 basis points for every 25 from the Fed. Mark DeVries : Okay. And anything you can share on what you're assuming around deposit betas in that guidance. Mark Graf : Yes, we've never talked about our deposit betas specifically, but I would tell you cumulatively the betas looking so CDs are 33% of the buck [ph] CDs always have a beta close to one. So we'll put that aside, but for the indeterminate maturity deposits the cumulative beta is sitting at 51, as we sit here right now. So it continues to be well below where you'd expect it to be cycle to-date. I would not expect there to be a lot of upward pressure on that from market rates. If there's any upward pressure it's likely to come from competitors as opposed to a lot of movements in the market. Mark DeVries : Okay, great. Thank you. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good evening. I guess, on loan growth I think it's clear your baseline on the economy is that it's okay and you're seeing opportunities for growth. But I was wondering if there's any specific attributes in the loan growth that make you comfortable with their resilience through a cycle. Because I mean it's pretty robust growth. Mark Graf : Yes, sure Sanjay. I would say, if I sit and I look at the nature of the growth, the line weighted FICO at acquisition in the card side continue to be right at about 7.30. So they continue to be very consistent in terms of what we have booked over time. And as we continue to book these new vintages, we see the card members come on more engaged with the brand, more engaged with the card and driving the types of behaviors that tend to drive long-term profitability. So we feel real good about that in terms of line utilization it's not like all these folks are coming on board and maxing out their line. So it's good responsible behavior that we're seeing out of those folks. The student lending business just continues to be a fabulous product for us risk adjusted basis it drives great returns we think it's a great introduction of new young people into the fold that can become a part of the broader Discover family as they grow. The personal loans business I think we've talked there and I would say we don't expect personal loans to be a giant grower. As we look into 2019, we do expect it's probably going to be -- balances there will be flattish to maybe a little up, but not a major contributor. And, of course, in student you're fighting a little bit of attrition from the acquired book too. So we would expect card to be the -- to drive the lion share of the growth in loans over the course of 2019. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. My follow up is for Roger. I guess, you guys talked about the importance of building out a global merchant acceptance via those initiatives. Is there any way to sort of assess the payoff economically as we look at those investments? Roger Hochschild : It's hard to look at that on a merchant by merchant basis. The payoff comes when you reach critical mass of coverage in any given market. And that benefits not just our own card issuing business, but also our network partners around the world who will see the benefits from that. So we have a very disciplined investment process that looks at target cost per merchant. When we can to a partnership with the network in a market of course lets us build acceptance at a very affordable cost, but that ongoing level of investment is embedded in the expense guides we\u2019ve provided for 2019. Mark Graf : Yes, and I think -- Sanjay, just to pile on to that for a second, I think the $35 million or so that came in, in the fourth quarter, I would say largely we encourage you guys to think about that as one-time that's why Roger kind of called it out specifically a Goldman. Anything else that we see currently is obviously baked into our guidance for 2019. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay, great. Thank you. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kenneth Bruce : Thank you, good evening. Let me pick up where you just left off on the comment about the building out of the global network. Understand that you've got some I guess factored into your guidance for next year. Do you feel like you're in the early stages of an investment cycle in terms of building out that acceptance? Is it something that is -- that we're going to be looking at in terms of a longer term payback. Maybe just give us a sense as to the kind of where we are in that cycle and kind of what the payback horizon may look like? Roger Hochschild : I would say it's been a long process of investment. So it's been continuous so it's been something we've been at for many years. I think the reason it's maybe attracting some attention now is really the lumpiness, Mark, talked about in the fourth quarter. But we view building out acceptance both in the U.S., but also in these international markets as critical components to our network strategy, which again is both monetizing it through our third-party Payment segment, but also driving our proprietary card growth. Kenneth Bruce : Okay. And maybe two part follow up so I can finish on that. So you would expect the payback to be over a longer horizon if I can just make that assumption you can correct it if not. And then, my follow up is just on the -- in the area of competition we\u2019ve seen quite a bit of increase in cost related to whether be acquisitions or rewards across the board. And I\u2019d like for you to maybe discuss where you think the competitiveness is within the specific segments that Discover is active? And how we should be thinking whether that is in a sense getting more competitive or some factor maybe is an easing, which was suggested by the press recently? Roger Hochschild : I mean, with our lend focused model are always in the prime lending space, we're not a sub-prime issuer. That business is always competitive, it can go up and down a bit, but in my 25 plus years in card issuing that there is never an easy time. You can see from our performance around new accounts, that we're booking more new accounts, our cost per account is coming down. And all of that is occurring as we've been tightening credit over the last couple of years. So we feel very good about our value proposition and how it can compete. In terms of overall activity, we believe a lot of the rewards competition has plateaued. You're not seeing the same pace of introduction of new programs. So it's going to remain competitive, but we feel good about our product, how it's positioned. And if you're buying business with big upfront incentives or the highest reward way in the market, you'll attract a disproportionate share of gamers and transactors neither fit with our long-term focus on the business. Kenneth Bruce : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Shane with JPMorgan. Richard Shane : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Roger, I appreciate your comments related to the shutdown and just wanted to ask two questions related to that. One is, how do you think your customer base indexes sort of more broadly against government employees, are you slightly higher concentrated in-line or lower? And then second, given that we're now almost 34 days in, which is pretty significant chunk of time. Have you seen any slowdown of change in spending behaviors? Roger Hochschild : So I'll start with the second one. We have not seen change in overall spending behaviors across our portfolio. Government, I don't think we over index for government employees we don't have necessarily employer account for our entire base, but it's not a meaningful percent. I think it's very important that all of us do everything we can to support the employees in this situation. And so that's why I called it out, but compared to programs we've done around major net natural disasters for example, in the past those have had a much more significant scale. Richard Shane : Okay, that's helpful context. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Just two questions related to the guidance, Mark, on the rewards rate I think historically the transition from Discover to Discover It product had about a 2 basis point inflation in the rewards rate. Is that still true? Mark Graf : Yes, I would say it's run somewhere over time between 2 and 3 basis points. I think last year it was 3 basis points. So, if you think about the sort of the guidance range, if you will, what we're kind of calling out is we really don't expect any pressure in rewards other than that continued migration as a greater percentage of the portfolio was made up of it card members? Eric Wasserstrom : Okay, great. And then just on the NCO guidance, I think last quarter you indicated on the personal loans component you expected a change third quarter to fourth and you came in a bit better. But I think the fourth quarter to first quarter of this year, I think that kinds of something like an incremental 40 basis points. Is that still your outlook? Mark Graf : Yes, I would say that feel somewhere in the right general zip code. I'm not going to call it out as a specific number at this point in time. But really, we saw a little bit of goodness in the fourth quarter relative to what we expected. We installed a number of new technologies in the personal lending business that are helping us really do a better job sniffing out synthetic fraud and really segregating our underwriting a little bit better. So, we are -- hopeful, we can do better than that 5-ish percent kind of guidance we gave last quarter. But for right now, we're early in the year. So I think I'll stick to something pretty close to that 40 basis points for the first quarter. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Buckingham. Chris Brendler : Hi, thanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on domestic spending for the 6% normalized rate down from 9% normalized last quarter. Despite what appeared to be a pretty successful rewards quarter. Is that just sort of tougher comps or a little bit macro slowdown so I think we had a good Christmas. So it's a little bit of surprise to see that magnitude of deceleration? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Yes, there are mix of factors in there. Part of it is a bit tougher comps, we booked a lot of new accounts in the fourth quarter of last year. And those of course, come on and activate and start spending quickly. There was a slowdown in holiday spending towards the back half of the holiday season. I think that's not just us, you've seen a number of major retailers pull that out. So those are probably the biggest drivers on the sales front. Chris Brendler : Okay. And a follow-up on your NIM guidance. Mark, does it matter that much what the Fed does, if the Fed sort of stayed on a more aggressive path, it would help out your yield. If not potentially deposit costs start to catch up with deals. Is that a big swing factor or is that doesn't play in fast enough to really matter to 2019 outlook? Mark Graf : No it's not a giant swing factor, I mean, it's a little bit inside baseball if I go back to the fall when we were putting together our operating plan for the year and you looked at the forward curve it assume two rate increases one in June and one in December. So you'd have gotten the benefit of half a year of one of those increases and essentially none of a year of the other of those increases. So if you go to zero it's not a giant impacter if you will. So I\u2019d take you back to that other thought really sitting back and saying roughly if we do get them all in including the deposit beta assumptions and everything else you're probably looking at somewhere between 4 to 6 basis points of NIM accretion coming flowing through as a result of the 25 basis point move where we\u2019ll get one. Chris Brendler : Awesome. Thanks so much, guys. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good evening. A follow up to that question, so 4 to 6 bps up if you get another 25 bps hike. But if we don't get another hike then I know your guidance is saying 10.3 plus minus with a bias to the upside. Is that bias also a 4 to 6 bp range? Mark Graf : No it really Betsy would depend on too much of what happens. I mean, I've got in pulling together thoughts around guidance, we've obviously got 50 scenarios we've run about what if this and what if this and what if this. I think you how you should interpret it is a lot more of those scenarios come out better than 10.3 than come out tougher than 10.3. And that's why we're kind of talking about a bias to the upside. I think at the end of the day if we see continued mitigation in the rate of increase in delinquency formation, which is kind of pretty flat right now or if we see charge off formation continue to moderate there could be some goodness there. But in terms of overall it's going to be a function of market rates, portfolio mix, promo activity, interest charge-offs deposit betas, funding mix and a whole host of other things. So it's hard to call. But I emphasize the bias to the upside for a reason. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then, maybe I could just have a follow up on how you're thinking about reinvesting the deposits that you've got I mean in this past quarter deposit growth was very strong in I believe the mid-teens or so. Can maybe you give us some color on how you're thinking about driving that growth rate in a flat rate environment and should we expect that that tails off, flows down or do you think you hold that level of deposit growth? And then, how do you think about the reinvestment of that given that the loan growth is more in the mid singles. Roger Hochschild : Yes, clearly we have multiple channels to use in our funding mix. So it's not as if we'll have to go out and buy assets or storied asset growth. Mark, will do his magic on the treasury side. I think we and others benefited from a big investor move towards cash in the fourth quarter. And so that drove flows up across the industry. But we do feel good about our ability to continue to grow deposits without posting at the top of the rate tables and having a value proposition very similar to card in terms of differentiated product service, customer experience, leveraging our brand and then also cross-selling into the card base. So deposits will continue to be the most significant part of our funding mix, we expect it to grow faster than assets, but that just therefore result in a shifting the overall mix. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. William Carcache : Good evening. The high end of your expense guidance is a bit higher than the low end of your loan growth and I know there it's difficult to be precise with all of the moving parts. But at a high level, Mark, you mentioned all of the different scenarios. Maybe could you just speak to at a high level your commitment to controlling expenses for the revenue environment and generating positive operating leverage in 2019. You guys have historically done a good job with positive operating leverage. But curious if you could speak to that in 2019? Mark Graf : Sure happy to. I would say the bulk of that investment activity -- I mean, obviously there is spend ongoing to support the generation of assets in a let's call it a BAU type environment. But the bulk of that incremental spend is really investment into a lot of these new technology platforms that Roger and I spoke about. Most of these new technologies are domiciled in the cloud as opposed to resident in our four walls. One of the big differences between traditional systems development within your own four walls and the cloud is you capitalize the traditional version so it doesn't have a big annual impact on expenses. Cloud-based development gets expensed. So a chunk of the increase really a big driver of the increase you're seeing year-over-year is the result of our continued migration due to deployment of lot of these new technologies that the results we're seeing from them are just really strong. And we feel very good about that. In terms of just overall the commitment to expense discipline, no question. I mean, I appreciate your commentary on the positive operating leverage. I think it's been a number of years since there was a negative number in front of that. Despite some really big investment activity on our part, so I think it underscores the strength of the revenue engine as well. But we definitively are committed to managing our operating expense base. We're committed to positive operating leverage and we unequivocally have leverage in the model, as I called out in my prepared remarks that if we see something in the environment start to change, we\u2019ve got leverage in marketing dollars, we got leverage in rewards costs, we\u2019ve got leverage in a lot of different items in the P&L that we won't hesitate to pull those levers if it's the right thing to do. William Carcache : That's very helpful. Thanks, Mark. If I can follow up quickly on credit, on an annual basis, we saw your provision growth exceed your loan growth by incrementally large amounts in 2015, 2016 and 2017, but the excess of provision growth over loan growth actually shrink in 2018. And this trajectory is consistent with some of the favorable credit trends that you highlighted in your prepared remarks. As we look ahead to 2019, is it reasonable to think -- to expect that that excessive provision growth over loan growth should continue to compress modestly? Mark Graf : Yes, I'm going to trying to stay away from answering that one specifically, because I don't want to give provision guidance. What I would say is we have called out that we continue to see the rates of increase in charge-offs in the card business moderate for five consecutive quarters. We obviously set our reserves and provide on a quarterly basis based on a whole number of factors that we see at that point in time. But the fundamental underlying underpinning piece that is the biggest component of it obviously is what are the trends we're seeing in credit. And those trends with normalization slowing continue to feel pretty good. But in terms of actually calling on a forward basis what provision is going be, I'm going to stay away from that one. William Carcache : Understood. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Robert Napoli : Thank you, and good afternoon. Question, new card growth in the past 11% and cost per account down 6%, pretty impressive combination is the new card growth in acceleration and what is going on with net card growth? Is the one-offs picking up, what is driving those really good metrics in card growth and cost per account? And then are those I guess the same quality of accounts, are you seeing any faster runoff of accounts? Mark Graf : Yes. So in terms of -- I would separate the two. First, we have not seen any change in attrition and given how we deliver on customer experience, our attrition tends to be the lowest in the industry. In terms of what's driving our card acquisition performance, it really is a lot of those investments around technology in particular next generation analytics and modeling as well as just how well the value proposition competes with millennials and younger consumers especially. So we're very pleased to see that. And again I'll repeat, all of that is in the context of continuing to tighten credit around our new account underwriting. Robert Napoli : Great, thank you. Follow-up question, just in line with the 2019 growth, Mark, one area you didn't give any color around and not you have in the past is the non-interest income revenue growth. And that's kind of been a low single-digit revenue growth item. Is that the continued expectation is kind of low single-digit growth of non-interest revenue? Mark Graf : Yes, I don't think we've historically guided on non-interest revenue Bob. And so, I'm going to kind of stay away from that one. It's not really a giant driver of our components of our P&L. Robert Napoli : Okay, great. Thank you very much, appreciate it. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Christopher Donat : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Mark, I had sort of a clarification, as you use the expression supply driven credit normalization a few times on the call. Just want to see if you could expand on that one. And then if you want to get philosophical, maybe also give us your view on what if at some point we ever have an end to the credit cycle what might cause that? Mark Graf : Well, on the first part that's easy to do. I would say the supply driven credit normalization if you think about the components that would drive an increase in charge -- delinquencies and charge-offs, you really have an incidence component. In other words, what percentage of the portfolio comes under stress and then you have a severity component, which is once that account does come under stress what's happened to the balances are they bigger now than they were a couple years ago. And I would say the driver cycle to-date in this has really been -- in our case has really been we have seen some verities increase much more so than we've seen incidence rates increase. So if you think about it, going through the crisis consumers delevered either by choice or otherwise. And so for a number of years coming out of the crisis they carried really low levels of leverage. Few years back consumer credit availability started creeping back in, consumer started levering up. So while we're not seeing a greater percentage -- much greater percentage of the book come under stress, when somebody does come under stress they're carrying more debt therefore the severity of the charge-off is bigger. We're referring to that as supply driven normalization because supply of consumer credit that's really been the primary driver of that. Speculating as far as what's going to be the driver of the next recession, there's a lot smarter people than me if you could ask who could give you a better sense on that one. I guess, what I would say is looking at the data seeing ever everything we see we don't see it as a consumer led issue it feels more geopolitical, global macro something like that, as opposed to an over leveraged consumer or a consumer asset bubble. Christopher Donat : Got it. I appreciate that one. And then just as a follow-up, I'll ask a very pedestrian one, of the other expense line on the income statement just a little higher than normal. Is that where we saw some of the merchant acquisition or your cloud based investments show up in that line or those elsewhere? Mark Graf : It's the global network stuff that we spoke about earlier on the merchant side that is showing up there. Christopher Donat : Got it. Okay. Thanks very much, Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Well, all my questions have been asked, I'm going to try out with painful topic Mark and it's related to CECL. I think specific question is I believe you're all supposed to start running parallel models now and I guess the specific question is you do you have enough, I guess inside to all the elements of CECL to begin running that if not where the uncertainties around what the modeling would entail? So do you have any comments around that at this point? Mark Graf : knew the question is going to come up. So no worries about the painful ask, not a problem. I guess, I would say one of the places a lot of that technology that Roger and I have alluded to a few times ago has been put to work in is in the CECL modeling. Trying to break away and come up with some machine learning approaches, really starting to think about every way we can to start slicing and dicing our portfolio. So we are in the process of going through what I would describe as a giant Monte Carlo simulation. The standard itself is very broad in terms of how you can think about and how you can define certain things. So we're doing a Monte Carlo simulation to really kind of figure out what the right answer for Discovery is, right? What's going to produce, essentially the best least volatile answer, that most accurately reflects the lost content and in the portfolio. So I would say the technology is largely in place. Now we're in the process of running these Monte Carlo simulations to figure out how exactly we want to think about this going forward. So parallel, yes, some point in time this year we will go to a full parallel. There's no question about that. And as we said at that point in time, once we have a sense of what that CECL reserve is going to look like, we feel like we have a disclosure obligation we\u2019d put in front of you. I would say right now, I would just underscore what we said before and that is in a CECL environment reserves will be higher and more volatile for consumer loans. As that\u2019s just the nature of the beast in terms of the way the standard is set and it would work. On the positive note, we continue to interact heavily with the FASB along with a number of our peer institutions, who are also actively engaged. There is a proposal out there to run, a lot of the volatility created CECL through AOCI as opposed to through the income statement and we're hopeful that the powers that we will see the wisdom in that instead of creating a truckload of EPS volatility that doesn't reflect the underlying trends in the business. John Hecht : Really appreciate that color. Thanks very much. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. Most of my questions actually also have been asked and answered and I think that it is kind of interesting that you've been talking for a couple of quarters about improvement in account acquisition costs and I think it's particularly notable that you're able to do that without increased reliance on promotional balances. And so, maybe it's not a fair question, but it seems like the entire industry is trying to do that. What -- is there anything you can tell us that you're able to -- any reason that you're able to do that and others aren't? Roger Hochschild : One thing we've always highlighted is the differentiation we get from our proprietary network. And so, I do think you\u2019ve seen two issuers that have proprietary network really stand out in terms of growth and both of us tend to be conservative on the credit side. The other thing I would say is just that relentless focus on the customer. We've won the JD Power Customer Experience Award for last five years It's not just the great 100% U.S. based customer service it\u2019s the mobile app, it\u2019s the rewards, it\u2019s the new features and benefits. So we look carefully at our targeted customers and are always thinking of new ways to add value. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. And maybe just from a credit standpoint since you've kind of given some expectation that losses will be higher the rate of increase on the personal loan side while it's a smaller piece of the portfolio is going to be higher than your overall expected rate of increase. I guess, I mean the arithmetic conclusion is that you're expecting that the increase in losses on credit cards set to be less than that. I mean -- so, I mean -- I think that is -- any kind of thoughts or additional insight you can give us there? Mark Graf : No I would say mathematically I agree with your conclusion, Moshe. It really -- we've seen some pretty big increases in the personal loan book and I think we've kind of called that out and talked about that one as you know pretty extensively in the past. We're hopeful that we can actually produce a better result than what we called out over the course of the last couple of quarters in terms of looking into 2019 there. But we're early in the year, so I'm not going to declare victory. But yes, the rate of increase in the charge-offs in the card book continues to moderate. We feel very good about that student loan book you can see in the supplement the statistics there is performing exceptionally well. So unless something else pops up that changes the trend it really does feel that both the card and the student businesses are performing really well from a credit perspective right now. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks so much. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Donald Fandetti : Hi, good evening. So, Roger, are there any competitive implications from the Fiserv, First Data acquisition in terms of PULSE on pin debit. And then secondarily, how do you think about that business, is that a strategic asset? I know it sort of leverages into rewards and debit cards and plays into tracking, but have you ever thought seriously about trying to monetize that? Roger Hochschild : Yes. So first we don't discuss M&A. So acquisitions and divestitures, but in terms of the merger I'd say it's probably too early to tell. Both companies are a good partners of ours, we compete in some parts, we partner in others. And so, I think we will watch that very carefully. In terms of the PULSE business, coming off a very strong year of performance. And clearly as we look at our Payment segment being able to offer both credit and debit capabilities out there is very important as a network. So we feel very good about the payments assets we've assembled both through the PULSE acquisition as well as Diners and are working hard to continue to increase the share of profits that come from payments. Donald Fandetti : Got it. That's all I had, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Caintic with Stephens. Vincent Caintic : Thanks. Good evening, guys. Just a few quick follow-up. So just first on a follow up on the global merchant acceptance. So it's great to see the partnerships that you've put together, just kind of wondering when we think about the medium term, what are your thoughts about increasing the merchant acceptance in terms of what the activities you plan to do there? Should we expect more partnerships, different products other investments? Roger Hochschild : Yes, I would say it's a continuation of a multi-year journey. So again getting a lot of attention because of lumpiness in the single quarter, but we've been working and if you go back and look at the stream of announcements, we've been working with merchant acquirers in markets outside the U.S. for many years. The one part I would say we're probably focused on are our partnerships with networks around the world, which brings us both broad acceptance in different markets, but also volume as they leverage our account number ranges are shifts backs. And so it helps to strengthen the overall network. And so, that's a strategic trust that you can expect to continue. Vincent Caintic : Okay, great. Thank you. And then just one more shifting to the private student loan market. So I noticed that the credit trends have gone better year-over-year in 2018 and they got progressively better over the course of each quarter in 2018. Just wondering if there is anything that's in particular that's driving that, and what should we expect for 2019? Thank you. Roger Hochschild : I would say, we\u2019ve had a growing portfolio at a pretty rapid rate over the course of a couple of years. And as that portfolio season it was getting to a maturation level you were seeing a bit of uptick in the credit statistics and the charge-off rates and the like. As that portfolio begins to -- as the growth there begins to moderate a little bit, I think you're seeing some of the impact of that. I think the other key piece of the puzzle is really just the discipline nature of the underwriting that's continue to go on there. You've got an average FICO in that book in the order of 750 right now. So it's a 20 points higher coming on the books than the average card account is. And just to remind all of you who don't live in the FICO world normally every 20 FICO points doubles the default risk. So a 750 defaults that has the risk of a 730 as a starting point on addition to that. So I would say that's a key piece of the puzzle as well. And obviously not to try taking credit for brilliancy you also have a really strong economy out there. These kids are coming out of school and they are able to find jobs. So that's a piece of the puzzle as well. So I'd say all those are contributing factors. Vincent Caintic : Great, thanks very much. Roger Hochschild : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Hi, thanks for taking my question. The new loan growth guidance is a bit lower than what we saw in 2019. Can you talk about how much of this is related to gas prices and non-gas price impacts? Because the impact be about maybe 2%. And then are there any other categories that are standing out within the spend that you see potentially slowing down, or is this just really related to you tightening those new card acquisitions? Thank you. Mark Graf : You bet. So I think there is a couple of pieces embedded in there. We do over indexed as a card to gas tends to be on the order of these days of about 5% of our sales. That's down from about 10% of our overall sales when gas prices were higher. So there definitely is a muting impact associated with the decline in gas prices there is no question about that. Certainly an element of it reflects just the tightening around the margin that Roger referenced earlier in terms of our credit standards, in terms of booking new accounts. And then the third piece of it obviously is look personal loans we've talked about we expect to be a -- pretty much a flat to a very modestly growing book. And that's a book that over the last couple of years has been a significantly higher grower. So I think taking that growth component out of the mix as well also has an impact. So put all those together and that's kind of how we're triangulating on that range. Dominick Gabriele : Great, thank you. And just really quick, can you talk about if you expect any impacts in the next few years in your student loan originations and loan growth given that Navient is kind of coming up to that here with new in school student lending product. And then maybe pushing a little harder on the refinance loans, could you just talk about the industry dynamics there. Thanks so much. Mark Graf : Yes, I mean, I think we intend to not to focus on any specific one competitor. So I would say in general the refi volume touch them, but just the whole growth of student loan refi has had an impact on our payment rate. And so that's something we're watching closely. We still been able to grow through that, but it's had a noticeable impact. And so, I think we'll see how sustainable that is both; A, as those companies at some point need to focus on profitability; and then, B, also as rate have risen. So refi does have an impact, but we are continuing to grow through it. Dominick Gabriele : Thanks so much, really appreciate it. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Jill Shea with Citi. Roger Hochschild : Jill? Mark Graf : Jill, are you there? Roger Hochschild : Cilicia, it looks like Jill may have dropped. Jill Shea : Sorry about that, can you hear me? Mark Graf : Yes, we got you. Jill Shea : Okay, thanks so much. So maybe just quickly on credit quality, in the past you've mentioned the portion of the loan loss reserve build that's related to the seasoning of accounts versus the normalization of the backlog. I was just wondering if you could give us an update there and what you're seeing in terms of trends? Mark Graf : Sure I\u2019d be happy to. In the fourth quarter this is in a sniper rifle kind of estimate. It's more of ballpark estimate, but I would say about two thirds of the provisioning was related to new accounts, about one third of the provisioning ballpark was related to the seasoning of the backlog, again reflecting that moderating pace of normalization taking place across the industry that we referenced earlier. Jill Shea : Okay, great. Thank you. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Craig Streem for any additional or closing remarks. Craig Streem : Sure, thanks Cilicia and thanks everybody for your questions. And we're available for any follow ups that you might have. Thanks, have a good evening. Operator : This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2019 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Craig Streem : Sure. Thank you, Thedra, and welcome, everyone, to our call this evening. We'll begin on Slide 2 of the earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was provided to the SEC in an 8-K filing and in our 2018 10-K, both of which are on the website and again, on file with the SEC. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild, covering first quarter highlights, and then Mark Graf, our CFO will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. And after Mark completes his comments, as always, we'll have ample time for Q&A. I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up during that period, so we can make sure that everyone has an opportunity. And now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, Craig, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. As you can see from our numbers, this was a very clean, solid quarter for Discover, reflecting continued execution on the key drivers of the business. We're in $726 million after-tax in the quarter or $2.15 per share, and generated a very healthy ROE of 26%. As always, our principal use of capital is to support profitable growth, but in the first quarter, we also returned just over $600 million of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, bringing the reduction in the level of outstanding shares to 7% from a year ago. Our emphasis on profitable growth means that we always look to achieve a balance amongst receivables growth, net interest margin, credit and operating expenses. And our performance this quarter demonstrates, how that approach continues to generate very strong returns. Total receivables grew 7%, with each major product performing as expected. And NIM came in at a very robust level, keeping us on track to hit our full year target for that important measure. Credit performance remains solid as the normalization impact on the back book continues to lessen and operating expenses were also consistent with our expectations, leading to a 50 basis point improvement in our efficiency ratio from last year's first quarter. As I said a moment ago, it's all about executing on fundamentals and striving for excellence in everything we do. Let's take a look at how that played out, for each of our principal products. In card, we saw strong receivables growth as we leveraged the opportunity provided my last year\u2019s significant new account growth. We also continue to drive a high level of engagement from our customer's, which is reflected in our increased sales volume. Year-over-year, we invested a bit more in brand advertising, while account acquisition spend was basically flat. From an earnings point of view, slower growth in card marketing costs, somewhat offset the higher rewards costs from this quarter's grocery category. Our private student loans business turned in another very strong quarter, with organic receivables growth 9% and further improvement in credit performance. In personal loans, our portfolio grew 2%, consistent with the outlook we shared with you. We continue to focus on originating loans that we expect will generate the appropriate level of long-term returns as opposed to simply targeting a higher level of growth and what continues to be very competitive environment. As expected, charge-offs were off in personal loans, principally driven by earlier vintages. Newer vintages are performing well, and we're seeing positive results from our revised underwriting strategy. Our Payment Services segment generated 9% growth in volume, largely due to the performance of PULSE. The PULSE team has been successful at winning new relationships and building businesses with existing issuers, by developing creative debit solutions that deliver meaningful value for partners. Wrapping up my part, our performance this quarter clearly demonstrates the strength of the Discover business model and our ability to deliver sound, profitable growth. The economic environment remains quite good. And we believe we're well positioned to deliver continued strong results. I'll now ask Mark Graf to discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark Graf : Thanks, Roger, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide 4. Looking at the key elements of the income statement, revenue growth of 7% this quarter was driven by strong loan growth and a higher net interest margin. With respect to the provision for loan losses, about two-thirds of the 8% increase reflects the seasoning of our strong loan growth, with the remaining third due to continued supply driven normalization in the consumer credit industry. Operating expenses rose 6% year-over-year, due to higher compensation expense and investments in support of growth and new capabilities. The effective tax rate for the quarter was just under 22%, due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. We continue to expect that our affective tax rate for the full year will be about 24%. Turning to slide 5. Total loans increased 7% over the prior year led by 8% growth in credit card receivables, with the majority of this increase coming in the form of standard merchandise balances. The contribution from promotional balances decelerated from the prior year and was a relatively modest contributor to growth this quarter. Looking at our other primary lending products, our organic student loan portfolio increased 9% year-over-year, while total private student loans balances were up 2%. Personal loans also increased 2%, which was in line with expectations given the slowdown in originations we've discussed over the past few quarters. Moving to the results from our payment segment. On the right-hand side on slide 5, you can see that proprietary volume rose 5% year-over-year. In Payment Services, PULSE volume continue to grow with a 9% increase over the prior year, driven by both new issuers as well as incremental volume from existing issuers. Network Partners volume increased 24%, primarily driven AribaPay, while Diners Club volume was down slightly from the prior year due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Moving to revenue on slide 6. Net interest income increased $205 million or 10% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances and increased market rates. Total non-interest income decreased $17 million, primarily driven by a 9% decline in net discount and interchange revenue. Gross discount in interchange revenue increased, driven by higher sales volume, which was up 7% year-over-year. However, this was more than offset by increased rewards costs due to higher customer engagement in the 5% rotating category. This higher engagement was the result of our featuring groceries this quarter as opposed to gasoline in the first quarter last year. As shown on slide 7, our net interest margin was up 23 basis points year-over-year and 11 basis points sequentially coming in at 10.46% for the quarter. Relative to the first quarter of last year, the net benefit of a higher prime rate was partially offset by higher costs in both brokered and direct-to-consumer deposits as well as higher interest charge-offs. Compared to the fourth quarter, the net benefit of higher prime rate was partially offset by higher costs and brokered and direct-to-consumer deposits with interest charge-offs being much less of a factor. Total loan yield increased 58 basis points from a year ago to 12.8%, primarily driven by 57-basis-point increase in card yield and 74 basis point increase in private student loans. Prime rate increases and a slight increase in revolve rate led card yields higher, partially offset by an increase in promotional balances and higher interest charge-offs. The increase in student loan yield was primarily driven by increased short-term interest rates. On the liability side of the balance sheet, average consumer deposits grew 15%, reflecting our success in attracting more stable and cost-effective funding. Consumer deposit rates rose during the quarter, increasing 15 basis points sequentially and 56 basis points year-over-year. While deposit beta did increase, cumulative betas continue to be better than historic norms. Turning to slide 8. Total operating expenses were $56 million higher than the prior year with the efficiency ratio at 37.1%, a nice improvement quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The increase in employee compensation and benefits was driven by average salaries, which included the impact of the higher minimum hourly wage we implemented in May of last year. A higher level of advertising spend drove marketing expense up 5% from the first quarter of last year, representing a lower growth rate than the 8% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter. Increased information processing costs reflects our ongoing investments in infrastructure and analytic capabilities. Professional fees were up year-over-year, primarily driven by increased collection costs related to higher recoveries in the quarter. I'll now discuss credit results on slide 9. Total net charge-offs rose 16 basis points from the prior year. The seasoning of loan growth from the past few years and supply-driven credit normalization continue to be the primary drivers of the year-over-year increase in charge-offs. Credit card net charge-offs rose 18 basis points year-over-year. From a sequential perspective, this was the sixth consecutive quarter of slowing year-over-year increases in card charge-offs. This positive trend reflects the fact that normalization continues to moderate. The credit card 30 plus delinquency rate was up 12 basis points year-over-year and two basis points sequentially. Looking forward, we expect to see continued solid credit performance in the card business. The credit performance of private student loans remain strong with net charge-offs down 26 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially as a result of efficiency gains in collections. Personal loan net charge-offs were up 50 basis points from the prior year and four basis points sequentially. The 30-plus delinquency rate was up 14 basis points year-over-year and decreased nine basis points sequentially. Looking at capital on slide 10, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 40 basis points sequentially, as card loan balances exhibited their normal seasonal decline. Our payout ratio for the last 12 months was 88%. To sum up the quarter on slide 11, we generated 7% total loan growth and a 26 return on equity. Our consumer deposit business posted robust growth of 15%, while deposit betas remain below expected levels. With respect to credit, while our charge-off rates had increased as loan growth seasons and credit conditions normalize, performance remains consistent with both our expectations and our return targets. Finally, we're continuing to execute on our capital plan, with strong loan growth and capital returns helping to bring our Tier 1 ratio closer to target levels. In conclusion, we're pleased with our performance this quarter and we remain comfortable with guidance we provided for 2019. That concludes our formal remarks. So now, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Thedra, to open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good afternoon. Roger Hochschild : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Just wanted to have two quick questions. One, on the rewards you highlighted that look this is the 5% rotating groceries. So as we go into next quarter, given the fact that you're going to have a different rotating, the question is, we would expect that you would have a decline in that rewards rate similar to prior years we've gone from grocery to gas over left in the following quarter, is that a fair expectation? Mark Graf : So what I would say, Betsy, I don't want to get into business doing quarterly guidance on rewards rates, but what I would say is you're absolutely, correct that the grocery category is the most lucrative. It's really easy for people to engage and max out the benefits. If you think about it, to spend $1,500 in groceries in the quarter, you only need to spend something less than $125 a week. So not a lot of people spend it on gas, but a lot of people spend that on groceries. So it tends to be very lucrative when we run that one. We did not very specifically revise our guidance on rewards rate. Matter of fact, I think in my prepared remarks I retreated all of our guidance we provided. So that probably -- that combination should probably give you a pretty good answer to that question. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then on the expense side, marketing costs looks like it decelerated a little bit. And I'm just wondering, is that because you don't need to spend as much too and send people to take the card out, because you've got the rotating and groceries? And so, is that a little bit of an offset to changing the category next quarter? Or is there something else that we should be thinking about maybe the efficiency that you've got going on the marketing spend, maybe that's what's going on there and it's more persistent, that's essentially the question? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. We're certainly seeing efficiency in our marketing spend. But I think a lot of that were just leveraging to drive more growth and to put on, for example, increased number of new accounts. There is a bit of an offset in terms of stimulating the portfolio, when we have a program that has as broad participation as grocery. But it also impacts new account marketing and there can be elements of seasonality to our spend as well. So I wouldn't necessarily read too much into it. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Obviously, NIM came in quite strong relative to our expectations and obviously, higher than the guidance, part of another range. I guess, Mark, when we look ahead, is there anything that should cause any downward pressure? Or should we assume that these are buildup of this level for the rest of the year? Mark Graf : No. I would say, again, we reiterated that NIM guidance. So along with all the rest of our guidance is that 10.3 plus or minus, Sanjay. We would expect just to give you a little bit of a thought there, we would expect a little bit of compression probably as we head into the second quarter. I think it's a couple of different things. Number one, revolve rate seasonality drives a piece of it, right? You're going to have a paydowns from some revolvers within normal seasonality, if you will. And then, of course, deposit cost continue to increase modestly as well. So you'll probably see a little bit of that. So I'd expect something in the order of mid single-digit compression in NIM from the first quarter into the second quarter. We feel good about the NIM guidance for the full year. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And my follow-up question is on CECL. Obviously, we got a little bit more clarity there from FASB. And one of your competitors came out and gave a pretty high number in terms of what they expect the impact on card balances to be. I was wondering if you had anymore guidance as it relates to CECL? Roger Hochschild : Sure. So I want caveats in here, Sanjay. I guess I would say, our models are not yet fully validated. There is a number of alternatives that remain under evaluation, and we're still analyzing a number of factors for a potential inclusion or exclusion based on their predictive capabilities over time. In addition, I just point out remind you that the ultimate impact won't really be determinable until the date of adoption, because it's really heavily dependent on both the composition and trends in our portfolio as well as our forward-looking view of the economy at the time of adoption. So -- but basically, if you want a preliminary estimate, I would say, based on the view that we have right now, you would have seen our total reserves, not just card, total reserves, somewhere between 55% and 65% higher than where they were this quarter, assuming we had adopted the standard this quarter. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And then when we think about how you're thinking about capital return, obviously, there is a phase-in element to it. How should we think about how you're planning for that? Mark Graf : Yeah, I think we've known about the phase-in all along. So we've been planning for that. And I think all of our forward capital planning contemplated nothing disconnected from a numbers I just shared with you. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Thank you. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : And your next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good evening guys. Mark Graf : Hey, Ryan good evening. Ryan Nash : Mark, maybe just a follow-up on the net interest margin question. I understand you're not in the business of quarterly guidance. When I think back years ago, when points in time when rates were stable. The NIM would have positive seasonality in the back half of the year. So I just want to maybe understand the puts and takes once we get beyond the next quarter. And then just related to that, if we are in a fed environment here, how do you think about the impacts on your deposit pricing going forward? Mark Graf : So maybe as opposed to giving specific guidance thoughts quarterly or seasonally, if you will, maybe I'll just talk about the key things that impact the margin and we would cover it that way, Ryan a little bit. So market rates, obviously, you talk about our current thoughts are the fed is done, right? There is no forward moves factored in any of our guidance. Portfolio mix will play a part. That is seasonal, right? There are times when you see higher level of revolve rate, lower level of revolve rate. There is also an element of that, that somewhat unpredictable, right? We do see transactors from time-to-time, coming in and engage and other times we see them disengage. And you can't always ascertain as to exactly why. So there is a seasonal element there. And there's just a local wildcard element there as well. Levels of promotional activity going to affect that. We said, we don't expect this year to be assembly promotional as last. Interest charge-offs, we've talked about normalization continues to moderate, but it's not over. And we do have the seasoning of growth. So there'll be a factor, but less of the factor probably. Deposit betas are there. I'll punk that to the second part of your question and obviously, funding mix and funding rates. And obviously, as we have fundings rolling off, we're replacing those fundings in a higher rate environment, so that's probably a bad guy. As far as deposit betas go, they remain fairly very well managed, Ryan. I mean, if you look at through history, usually deposit rates keep going up for a little while after market rates stop, but it's not particularly concerning factor for us. Ryan Nash : Got it. Appreciate the color. And then Roger, we\u2019ve heard a competitor to talk about being capital online. I think late last year you talked about tightening a bit. But you're still seeing a high single-digit growth. Can you just talk about what you're doing online? And are you still tightening credit? And or do you expect that we could continue to sustain this type of growth? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Yes. I want to make clear that we're tightening credit as we grow. And that I do expect unless we see significant changes in economics to the good side, that this lane of cycle, we'll continue to be quite a little being on the cautious side. So, as I look at the changes that come through credit policy, they continue to be more on the contractionary side than expansionary. That doesn't mean we're not still looking to leverage our advances in analytics. So identified we take kind of swap-in, swap-out that would let us grow faster and improve credit performance. And then continued focus on differentiation, the better your product is and the better you can compete in the marketplace that would drive your growth even as you are disciplined on the credit side. And I think that's always been one of our hallmarks here. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Operator : And your next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good evening Roger and Mark. One of your competitors has indicated that the digital investments they've been making over the years have positioned them to exit legacy data centers and fully migrate to the cloud by roughly the 2020 time frame. And this positions them for meaningful improvement of operating efficiency by 2021. Can you discuss whether Discover sees a similar potential for a step function improvement and efficiency from a similar dynamic in the future? And any other thoughts around that dynamic would be helpful? Roger Hochschild : Yes. I mean, certainly, there are benefits from a cost standpoint in migrating from legacy data centers to more a cloud-based infrastructure. But, I guess, I would view that as not necessarily the most exciting piece of the advanced analytics journey. It's really been, how do you leverage the data and that much cheaper storage in the cloud for speed and driving business benefit. And so as we think about the benefits from advanced analytics, that's a piece, but not even necessarily when I see the most exciting piece. Mark Graf : That, in addition to that, Bill I would also note, we have for a couple of quarters now talked about the fact that we do see an opportunity to bring our efficiency ratio down over time. We've noted as the general purpose issuers we're already the lowest. But we see over time an opportunity to lower it. And that migration into a cloud-based environment is a key piece of that thought process. Bill Carcache : That's really helpful. Thank you. And separately, can you give us an update on your prepaid debit product is going? What's the engagement from existing Discover customers? Are you attracting new customers? Has there been any pushback for merchants on the higher pricing that you enjoyed due to your Durbin exemption? Mark Graf : Yes. You're talking about the checking product? Bill Carcache : Yes. Roger Hochschild : Yes, so not a prepaid, just a checking. Bill Carcache : I am sorry. Yes. Great. That's great. Roger Hochschild : Yes. No. no. We're excited with how that doing. We continue to grow it at a steady pace. We\u2019ve ramped up the marketing of that product. One of the great things about taking account is how sticky the deposits are, but I think that also is part of the challenging growing it. We have not received any pushback from merchants. The volume there is still a very low portion, but in terms of the quality of the accounts, we're booking, we're very excited. Average age is about 35, so targeting that younger demographic we're seeing about 25% of the customers set up direct deposit, but we're also seeing 25% open a savings account. So that impact on deposits is beyond just the checking balances we get. And you tend to see a lower beta on those savings accounts, when they will also have checking relationship with you. So I would say, continued focus on growth of that product. Bill Carcache : Very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : And your next question comes from Chris Brendler with Buckingham Research. Chris Brendler : Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask on the acceleration you saw in sales volume. Was there any extra or lacking processing days, some other issuers and networks you called out, your processing days as well as Easter holidays? So 6.6% growth actually could be little better than you reported to make sure that's the case? Roger Hochschild : Yes. We would not call any adjustments like that. It's a clean number. Chris Brendler : Great. And does that mostly driven by the successful rewards promotion, anything else that's driving the increased pickup in spending in the face of most people showing some deceleration this quarter? Roger Hochschild : I would say, we saw a broad-based pickup in spend. But there's no question that the grocery promotion did play a part on that as well. Chris Brendler : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : And your next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Roger, I think the consensus view in the card industry is competition sort of peaked loan growth seems to moderate it. But if you look at credit performance and the returns from Discover and a lot of the other issuers, return are very good. Looking at some of the banks, at JPMorgan, their loan growth picked up a bit. What do you think the chances are of your bank competitors reaccelerating? Or do you think they're going to look at the cycle and just sort of weight low until we get the downturn? Roger Hochschild : It's hard to talk for an entire industry. But I think in general, it dominated by large sophisticated players with good risk management who have been to most cycles. So, I guess, I's probably be surprised that someone who started growing aggressively at this point borrowing some fundamental changes in the economy and people is to where we are. You see quite a lot of discipline out there from the major issuers. We see a lot of continued competitive focus around transactors and at the high end transactor segment. And we tend to focus more on a lend-driven versus spend-driven model. But, again, I would expect continued discipline. Don Fandetti : And Mark, just to clarify on credit. On delinquency trends year-over-year have been very steady, it sounds like you expect that to sort of stay in that zone, is that correct? Mark Graf : Yes, I would say, we don't give quarterly delinquency guidance, but I would say, what I would really underscore is, normalization is continuing to moderate, if not over. But for six consecutive quarters now, we're seeing the rate of formation and charge-offs moderate. Delinquency trends are obviously a leading indicator of that for a little bit as well. So, I would say we feel pretty good. I would say, going forward, provisioning will continue to come more and more a function of loan growth as opposed to that normalization piece. Don Fandetti : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Roger Hochschild : Hey Moshe. Moshe Orenbuch : Thank you. So, I guess, I was just wondering, you talked a little bit about marketing spend. Can you relate that to the cost you're a very impressive lower cost for 2018, is that continuing? Roger Hochschild : Yes. We continue to see strong performance on the cost for new accounts. And again, achieving that when you tighten credit, it tends to be the cheapest more responsive accounts that you cut. So, in a tightening environment, I am even more excited by the progress that the team has. And again, it's leveraging the advances in analytics and it also continued shift towards more and more of the mix being on the digital side. But we expect continued strong performance this year as well. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks. And switching over to personal loans business. I mean, the business -- the growth has kind of -- is slowed, but the other metrics are coming off, deteriorating as much as, I guess, as I thought you seen to indicate in the past and noticing that you've got probably a 20%, 25% decline in overall volume in the industry. Can you talk about your plans there? Is that something you would start up again? I mean, how do you think about your performance there and what the outlook is? Roger Hochschild : Yes, I think we've tried to be very explicit around the channels that we cut back on. Some of them were more of the aggregator and the unsolicited channels. And one of the things we highlight was the new vintages we're booking. We're pleased with the credit quality. So, we have made adjustments both to our account mix and our underwriting strategy. And we're achieving the returns we want from what we can see from the newer vintages. In terms of overall industry mail volume rates, you had a couple players whose mail volumes were just off the chart. And I think it appeared unsustainable. So, I wouldn't be surprised. The other thing is a lot of them, underwriter much broader spectrum than we do. So, we're probably competing head-to-head against the subsequent of their overall volume. But I would just view that as some of the excesses is getting flushed out of the system. It's probably still going to remain competitive. Mark Graf : And Moshe, to the point looking a little bit better than what we've taught or guided, I would say, we definitely saw Q1 come in a little bit better. I would say collection strategies and some of the technology we've layered into the synthetic broad has had a pretty meaningful impact. Not going to call a trend based on one quarter at this point in time, but with charge-offs up only four bps quarter-over-quarter and delinquency coming down, it does feel like possibly there's an opportunity there. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : And your next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Hi guys. Thanks very much. Mark, you talked about -- you mentioned the terms supply-driven normalization. And I assume that means that kind of incremental or marginal dollar getting into the consumers pockets got a little bit more risk tied to it. And then Roger, you guys -- you're talking about marginal tightening. So, are you guys seeing some participants into market? You're taking incremental underwriting risk? Is that dictating how you're managing credit trends at this point of time? Roger Hochschild : It's very hard to see, especially real-time what competitors are underwriting. So, we tend to focus on our product and again, different competitors have different strategies targeting other segments. So, it remains competitive. But, again, we continue to see, as I look at competitors earnings and what they're putting up, people seem to be saying discipline. Mark Graf : And the supply-driven normalization piece, really a flex of fact that coming out of the crisis, consumer credit was pretty restrained. So, consumer leverage ratios were very low by historic standards. And what we saw is time went on, as consumer credit availability kept back in, a lot more providers willing to provide credit. So, you saw consumers re-lever back toward normalized levels of leverage. And that's what really driven that. The supply credit has driven that re-leveraging and its driving normalization of loss rate. John Hecht : Okay. And then, I know it's early on, Mark, but you talk about seasoning of the credit book normalization and so forth. How do you think the 2018 vintage looks against the 2017 vintage at this point in time? Mark Graf : It's too early to call. And we don't typically tend to talk about vintages in isolation. What I would say is, I think, both Roger and I have over the course of the last couple of quarters talked about advancements in advanced analytics and our ability to do a better job, targeting and detecting synthetic fraud as well. So, I would say, we feel good about the current accounts we are booking and those we booked in 2018. John Hecht : Great. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Chris Donat : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, wanted to follow up on your comment on deposit betas. And I'm just wondering if there is anything you're seeing in the competitive market? You said that the overall deposit betas were pretty well managed. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any competitors be more aggressive than you'd like. Or do you feel like, because of what you have in deposit now and even the savings accounts, private checking and that you don't need to worry about what competitors do? Mark Graf : I would say, there's always somebody who you scratch your head about a little bit in most businesses, I guess. But in terms of where we are, I mean, cycle to date, I think our beta on our deposits has been 51. So continues to be lower than you would expect at this point in time. I would say, we are now up to -- I think, traditionally we've said over 60% of our depositors have a relationship with us on the card side as well. I think that is now approaching 70%. I think it's up to like 68% at this point in time. So that cross-sell provides some virtuous benefit there. They don't tend to be just retail capital markets customers re-shopping. So we tend to target being in that six to 10th place in the bank rate table, as opposed to the first and the fifth place, and it's a strategy that had e served both us and our customers well, we think. Chris Donat : Okay. And then, on a completely different topic, just wondering, as you think about the student loan market, there was one of the democratic presidential candidates, for that a proposal that included canceling private student loans -- again, it's a proposal. But anyway, just as you think about student loans, some competitors had exited the market over the years and I think partly because of the concerns the regulatory environment could change. Just how do you think about the potential for big changes in regulation of student loans, including your private student loans, not just the federal side? Roger Hochschild : Yes. I wouldn't read too much yet into the proposals of individual democratic candidates. So I think we have a long way to go before anyone's elected or anything gets put into law. It is a very, very complex product to originate. And I think when the federal loan program expanded, a lot of players decided the volume wasn't worth it. We're very excited about that business and it continues to perform well. Your pricing more new entrants coming into that than exit, as I look at this year's season versus the last. But it's a business that we feel good about. Chris Donat : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Thanks guys for taking my questions. Look, we did see a delay in tax refunds. But I think by the end of tax season, it seems to have really caught off on a year-over-year basis. I am curious, if you saw any state level distortions that we should think about as we consider normal seasonality as we move through the rest of the year? Mark Graf : No, Rick. We really didn't see much out of the ordinary in terms of any pockets of particular strength or pockets of particular weakness. Rick Shane : Great. Thanks, Mark. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : And your next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Thanks. I have a two-part question around capital planning. Could you just talk about what the capital planning and approval process looks for you here, both timing and process over the next year? And then second question is, I think in the past, you've historically talked about eventually targeting an economic capital level of maybe 10% to 11% CET1, but it had obviously be about that, given some of the regulatory constraints. But given maybe a less constrained process going forward, should we expect you to kind of migrate down towards that level? And if so, how I might see some kind of play a part in that transition? Roger Hochschild : So I would say the capital planning process for us at this point in time continues to evolve. There is the guidance out there about the $100 million to $250 million banks that still requires a little bit more specificity, so we understand exactly what it ultimately going to look like. But I would say, this year, specifically, we were granted an exemption from CECL and had a worksheet-based, formula-based approach to improve our capital ask, if you will. Still a strong governance process through our Board and everything else around that and our planned capital actions, we're not outside the range that was allowed in that process. Yes, we definitely see an opportunity to continue to migrate our capital levels lower. I think we've said that with the CCAR, having been modified or gone away for us that the rating agencies, Mark, are probably the buying constraint for us at this point in time. I think 10.5% is definitely in the cards in our eyes at this point in time. And the CECL overlay, there is the three-year phase-in associated with that. And getting back to my earlier comments, the 55% to 65% range I gave earlier with an awful lot of caveats, I would say is not inconsistent with our thoughts or the thinking around that target capital ratio. Mark DeVries : Got it. Thank you. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : And your final question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Brian Hogan : This is Brian Hogan turning for Bob Napoli. Good afternoon. Roger Hochschild : Hey, Brian. Brian Hogan : First question actually on the home equity loan product, which is in the other loans. Obviously, you got some pretty strong growth there, 89% in that category. I guess, what is the long-term potential of that product? And how long can it grow at a very rapid pace? And what is your plan to grow? Mark Graf : Yeah. I would highlight it is coming off a very small base. So over time, we think it can grow into a nice business, but it's going to be, while it's a meaningful portion of our overall loan book. Brian Hogan : All right. And then the next -- final question is actually more related to your payments and network outlook. Just what are you doing to drive more growth along that -- along your network in your payments business and obviously you have SAP Ariba, but SAP doing more stuff with competitors as well like American Express in my view. Are you seeing -- what are you seeing out there from like a partnership perspective or what are you doing to grow that network business? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. So you mentioned the SAP Ariba arrangement the amount American Express, I don't think -- expect that to have a material impact on profitability of our arrangement with SAP. There is -- it's hard to go over everything we're doing on the payment side. There's a couple of highlights here, certainly PULSE represents a significant portion of our profitability. They continue to execute well as you can see from the growth there. And we see room for continued growth. We also -- I probably most excited by some of our international network partnerships. We call them our net-to-net where we provide technical support, including our BIN ranges, chip spec, et cetera. There we provide acceptance for them everywhere outside their home market. They provide acceptance for us. I just got back from a regional conference in Vietnam and very excited about opportunities we're seeing in Asia. So again, we see a lot of room to continue growing our payment segment, but also continuing to leverage our proprietary network to drive value for our core card issuing business. Brian Hogan : All right. Thank you. Operator : And we do have a question from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS Securities. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you for sneaking me in. Mark, just a couple of quick questions. In the past, you've talked to the proportion of your growth in receivables that coming from existing customers. Has that trend changed at all recently? Mark Graf : No. It's been pretty healthy. It tends to bounce somewhere between 60/40 and 40/60. So on average we talk about it sort of as a 50/50 kind of range. This quarter, I think it trended a little bit more towards the 60% new and 40% back book, but again, relatively consistent. Eric Wasserstrom : And in your K, you had a disclosure about some change in TDR policy. Can you just explain what was occurring there? Mark Graf : So, last year, there were a number of workout programs that we decided we should classify as TDRs. So you saw a big migration in early last year as we went through the process of reclassifying those programs into TDRs. That was a big piece of the puzzle. And then as we continue to originate significantly larger vintages over time, you see migration into TDRs as well. I would say, there's been a little bit noise out there we've heard on the TDR book. I would say -- I really don't think it's warranted. If you look at the 90-day past dues in TDRs, they have continued to be below -- slightly below 5% on a very consistent basis over the course of the last two years. And those programs can be a very effective way to work with customers. So, we think it's customer-friendly and the credit impacts that are negligible. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. Thanks very much. Mark Graf : You bet. Operator : And I will now turn the floor back over to Craig Streem for any additional or closing remarks. Craig Streem : Sure. Thanks, Thedra and thank you all for your attention, your questions. You know how to find us for any follow-up. We're there for you. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2019 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Craig Streem : Thank you, Erica [ph] welcome everybody to our call this afternoon. I\u2019ll begin briefly on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in today\u2019s earnings press release and presentation.Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild, covering second quarter highlights, and then Mark Graf, our Chief Financial Officer will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. And after Mark completes his comments there will be plenty of time for question-and-answer session. But we\u2019d limit yourself to one question please and one follow-up so we can make sure that everyone gets one and now beginning on Slide 3.It\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks Craig, and thanks to our listeners for joining today\u2019s call. Very simply this was another very good quarter for us with solid loan growth, strong net interest margin and ongoing improvements in underlying credit performance. We earned $753 million after tax or $2.32 per share and generated a robust return on equity of 26%. Our ability to balance loan growth with disciplined credit management continues to generate very strong returns while our investments in the Discover brand and advanced technology enhance our ability to drive a differentiated customer experience and competitive advantage, to that point, we were recently awarded the highest ranking by J.D. Power for customer satisfaction among credit card, mobile apps and websites. This recognition highlights how our investments in technology and analytics have enabled us to deliver industry leading customer value while maintaining operating efficiency.Looking at some of the specifics of our second quarter performance; total loans were up 6%, with strong credit performance across all of our products reflecting our disciplined and underwriting new accounts and line management along with continued investments in collection capabilities. Looking to our lending products, the 7% growth in card receivables was forced from a healthy mix of new, versus existing customers. In terms of card portfolio mix growth was primarily from higher yielding merchandise balances versus promotional balances.We\u2019ve previously shared with you our intent to decrease the level of growth from promotional activity and that trend continued in the second quarter. This provided a meaningful contribution to our net interest margin performance this quarter. Turning to our student loan business, growth remains strong and as we entered the peak season early origination activity looks good and is consistent with our expectations. We believe, we\u2019re well positioned to continue to gain market share.In personal loans, our recent credit tightening has achieved its desired effect with both charger off and delinquencies declining from the prior quarter and loan growth consistent with our target. We remain focused on originating loans that will generate satisfactory long-term returns rather that pursuing faster growth in what remains a very competitive environment. Overall, underlying credit trends continue to be favorable across our lending products as the normalization impact on the back book continues to lessen and credit performances increasingly driven by growth in receivables.Our payment services segment generated a robust 15% increase in pretax income driven by strong growth in volume, that majority of which came from our PULSE business. The team at PULSE continues to win new relationships and build business with existing issuers by developing creative debit solutions that deliver meaningful value for partners. We continue to execute our strategy in payments to enhance global acceptance by investing in partnerships primarily with local acquirers in Western Europe as well as adding to our network-to-network alliance partnerships as we make progress against our objective of universal merchant acceptance.In summary, our results this quarter reflects a disciplined and commitment to excellence that will bring to serving our customers and delivering long-term value to our shareholders. Clearly, the favorable economic environment is contributed to our performance and we don\u2019t see any signs this is changing in the near-term. Nevertheless, we recognized that this may moderate at some point and are continuing to adapt our growth in credit strategies as appropriate.Before I turn the call over to Mark, I want to highlight two important additions to the Discover team. First, I want to welcome Wanji Walcott, our new Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel. Wanji joins us from PayPal with significant prior experience at American Express shows she brings a wealth of highly relevant knowledge to Discover. I also want to welcome Jennifer Wong, Chief Operating Officer at Reddit who has joined our Board of Directors. Jen will be an invaluable addition to our board bringing deep experience in media and digital advertising.I will now ask Mark to discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark Graf : Thanks Roger and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll begin by addressing our summary financial results on Slide 4. Looking at the key elements of the income statement revenue growth at 10% this quarter was driven by solid loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Looking at the provision for loan losses roughly three quarters of the 6% increase was driven by the seasoning of the loan growth with the remaining 25% reflecting continued supply driven normalization in the consumer credit industry.Operating expenses were up 10% year-over-year due to higher compensation expense and investments in support of growth and new capabilities. The effective tax rate for the quarter was in line with our expectations at 24%. Turning to Slide 5, total loans increased 6% over the prior year led by 7% growth in credit card receivables. As Roger noted, higher yielding standard merchandized balances were the primary driver of the increase. While the contribution from promotional balances was less of a factor this quarter as it continued to decelerate. Compared to the prior year promotional balances were down 80 basis points and dropped 70 basis points sequentially reflecting our decision to decrease the level of growth from promotional activity over the last several quarters.Turning to our other primary lending products, our organic student loan portfolio increased to 9% year-over-year while total private student loan balances were up 3%. Personal loans increased 2% which was in line with expectations given the slowdown in our originations which we have mentioned previously.Moving to the results from our payment segment, on the right-hand side of Slide 5 you can see that proprietary volume was up 4% year-over-year. In payment services, PULSE volume increased 7% over the prior year driven by incremental volume from existing issuers, new issuers on the network as well as growth in our PINless products such as PULSE PAY Express and PULSE e-commerce. Network Partners volume was up 29% primarily driven by Revit BIM. Diners Club volume was up 1% over the prior year having been impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange movements.Moving to revenue on Slide 6, net interest income increased $203 million or 10% from a year ago driven by higher loan balances and increased market rates. Total non-interest income increased $46 million primarily driven by 14% increase in net discount and interchange revenue. The 5% increase in gross discount in interchange revenue was primarily driven by the year-over-year increase in sales volume which was also up 5%. Rewards cost were flat to the prior year and up a bit sequentially reflecting increases in sales volume, offset by lower utilization in the rotating 5% category. Just to remind you, groceries which we featured in the first quarter is a rotating category that attract the highest level of spending and quarterly shifts in the 5% category can have a significant impact on both the rewards rate and sales volume.As shown on Slide 7, our net interest margin was 10.47% for the quarter up 26 basis points year-over-year and one basis point sequentially. Relative to the second quarter of last year, the net benefit of prime rate increases in March, June and December 2018 as well as favorable shift in the promotional balance mix and revolve rate were partially offset by higher deposit costs in both brokered and direct consumer, a higher charge offs of accrued interest. Compared to the first quarter, the benefits from two additional cycle days a shift in promo balance mix and a favorable funding mix were mostly offset by the higher cost in brokered and direct consumer deposits.Looking forward, our outlook for net interest margin reflects continued strong credit performance and favorability in portfolio mix, balanced against a degree of uncertainty around the timing and level of set actions. That said, it\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s looking more likely that full year net interest margin will evidence a bit of upside biased we spoke about when we provided 2019 guidance. Total loan yield increased 54 basis points from a year ago to 12.82% primarily driven by an increase of 56 basis points in card yield and a 54 basis point increase in private student loan yield. Prime rate increases favorability in the revolve rate in a lower level of promotional balances led card yields higher partially offset by an increase in interest charge offs.As we noted earlier, the mix of lower yielding promotional balances decreased 80 basis points from a year ago reflecting the slowdown in growth from [indiscernible] activity which had a positive impact on card yields and overall NIM. The year-over-year increase in student loan yield was primarily driven by higher short-term interest rates as slightly over 60% of the portfolio is at a variable rate. On the liability side of the balance sheet, average consumer deposits grew 16% and now make up over half of total funding. The strong growth in consumer deposits reflects our continued focus on attracting more stable and cost effective funding. Consumer deposit rates rose during the quarter increasing five basis points sequentially and 49 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see cumulative deposits betas below historic norms. As we consider potential cuts in the feds funds rate. We expect that the results in decline in loan yields would be mostly but not completely offset by lower funding costs. We\u2019ve been trimming our asset sensitivity and expect to be down to roughly three quarters of 1% asset sensitive by the end of the third quarter.Turning to Slide 8, total operating expenses rose $94 million from the prior year. Employee compensation increased $27 million driven by higher average salaries and benefits which included the impact of the higher minimum hourly wage we implemented in May, 2018. Information processing costs were up reflecting our continued investment in infrastructure and analytic capabilities. Professional fees increased $22 million primarily due to increased collection costs related to higher recoveries in the quarter as well as investments in new capabilities.Now I\u2019ll discuss our credit results on Slide 9. Total net charge offs rose 11 basis points from the prior year. The increase in charge offs continues to be primarily driven by the seasoning of loan growth in the past few years and to a lesser extent supply driven credit normalization. Credit card net charge offs were 15 basis points higher year-over-year. From a sequential perspective this was the seventh consecutive quarter of slowing year-over-year increases in card charge offs and as trend reflects the fact that normalization continues to moderate.The credit card 30 plus delinquency rate was up 18 basis points year-over-year and down 11 basis points sequentially. Credit performance in the card business continues to be very solid reflecting our disciplined approach to credit management in both new and existing accounts. Private student loan credit performance also remains strong with net charge offs down 31 basis points year-over-year and five basis points sequentially aided by efficiency gains in collections. Personal loan net charge offs were up 36 basis points from the prior year and down 20 basis points sequentially. The 30 plus delinquency rate was up seven basis points year-over-year and decreased two basis points sequentially. Credit performance in the personal loan portfolio continues to stabilize which you can see reflected in the sequential improvements in both charge-offs and delinquency.Looking at capital on Slide 10, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased 10 basis points sequentially as loan balances grew. Our payout ratio for the last 12 months was 82%. We recently announced that our Board of Directors has approved our capital plan for the four quarters ending June 30, 2020 which includes $0.04 per share increase in our quarterly common stock dividend as well as planned share repurchases up to $1.63 billion over the new four quarters. I\u2019ll remind you we were not subject to CCAR for 2019 but will require [indiscernible] capital plan that was approved by our Board of Directors and submitted to regulators.As always, we remain committed to efficiency deploying our shareholders capital by focusing on profitable and disciplined asset growth and returning excess capital via dividends and share repurchases. To sum up the quarter on Slide 11, we generated 6% total loan growth and 26% return on equity. Our consumer deposit business saw a strong growth of 16% while deposit rates increased 49 basis points year-over-year. With respect to credit, while our charge off rates have increased as loan growth seasons and credit conditions normalized performance reflects positive trends across our lending products and remains consistent with both our expectations and our return targets. And last but not least, we\u2019re continuing to execute on our capital plan with loan growth in capital returns helping to bring our capital ratio closer to target levels.In conclusion, this was a terrific quarter for us characterized by continued receivables growth, solid credit performance and very strong returns. That concludes our formal remarks, so I\u2019ll turn the call back to our operator Erica [ph] to open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Bob Napoli : Solid quarter and Mark, sorry to see you leaving next year but it\u2019s been great working with you. Question on CECL I guess and hopefully you\u2019re not leaving because of CECL mark. I know that\u2019s frustrated you there a little bit. Can you \u2013 the reserve build, do you have an idea what do you expect the reserve build to be and then, maybe more importantly after the reserve build, just any thoughts you would have on, what effect CECL would have on earnings growth over the long-term, on average overtime? Mark Graf : Sure. First of all, Bob, I would say thanks for the kind words. I appreciate it. I have enjoyed working with you and all the folks in the market tremendously over the last nine years so I\u2019m not gone yet so you got to suffer through with me for a little while. In terms of CECL, I would say Bob there\u2019s no change to our 55% to 65% guesstimate for the increase in reserves at adoption of CECL. Now I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t remind you that is a guesstimate, it\u2019s heavily dependent on both the composition and trends in the portfolio and the forward-looking view of the economy actually at the time we adopt. But again, if we had adopted this quarter it looks like roughly a 55%, 65% range would be the right way to think about it.In terms of where that impact comes in, its longer duration, higher lifetime loss content assets and [indiscernible] managed asset classes are obviously pretty heavily depended on a macro factor in a CECL environment. So, the volatility going forward I think is really going to be the speed and level of change in macroeconomic forecast will really be the driver in volatility as you sit and look at those things in addition to loan growth, itself right. There\u2019s a penalty for growth under CECL, so those would be the moving parts and pieces.I think our number one concern remains comparability across issuers is going to be challenging. So, it\u2019s going to be incumbent upon us to provide really good disclosure and for all the users of the financial statements to really dig in there. Bob Napoli : The capital return is a little bit below what we were looking for is that because of CECL, was just trying to figure out, is that all related? Mark Graf : So CECL and the implementation of CECL definitely impacted our thoughts in terms of the forward four quarter ask in terms of the [indiscernible] or churn basis, yes. Bob Napoli : Great, so I thought. Thank you appreciated. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Rick Shane : I wanted to ask a little bit about transition on promotional rates. I\u2019m curious what the results have been with promotional balances that you\u2019ve been able to convert to full pay in the way that you anticipated. Is the NPV MF [ph] program what you expected? Roger Hochschild : Promotional balances remain very profitable for us and it\u2019s a mix of using promo rates around ET and retail for new accounts as well as targeted offers to our existing portfolio so profitability has been very strong. It\u2019s just some of the growth we\u2019re seeing around merchandized balances and some other forms of stimulation including rewards are working well and so that\u2019s driving down the overall mix that\u2019s at promotional rates. Mark Graf : And in terms of NPV part of the question I would say, yes, the NPV\u2019s continue to perform in line with expectations and candidly some of the level of focus on promotional balances obviously as you know, do we believe in the current environment based on competitor actions and otherwise. Do we have the ability to keep hitting those NPV\u2019s and if we can\u2019t, we pull back because we don\u2019t want to put asset growth on the books that doesn\u2019t meet our desired return thresholds? Rick Shane : Great, thank you. And then, you\u2019ve alluded to the fact that you\u2019ve been able to implement some strategies to dampen asset sensitivity. Can you talk a little bit about that? Mark Graf : Yes, principally what we\u2019ve been doing is over the course of the last several months we\u2019ve been adding to our invest portfolios specifically buying short dated treasuries [indiscernible] two years in. it\u2019s been the primary vehicle we\u2019ve used to accomplish that dampening on the asset sensitivity side. I think realistically there\u2019s a little bit more room there to add, a little bit more on the treasury book. But and there also be some synthetic activities will engage in to do principally and then asset swaps will be the way to think about it. We\u2019re in market today, with an ABS floater, a two-year ABS floater. Specifically, we won\u2019t swap that fix, the way we\u2019ve done over the years with a number of our ABS floaters as well, that will also help in that capacity that\u2019s about $800 million deal roughly give or take. Rick Shane : Thank you, guys, very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Was hoping you could help us better understand the pace of reserve builds. While the year-over-year increases in delinquencies and charge offs have been improving at a fairly steady pace changes and the reserve ratios have been more erratic with some quarters like this one, where there\u2019s almost no change sequentially and quarters like the last one where it was up 17 basis points. And this quarter is kind of flat was actually in a period where, for the first time in a while you actually saw your year-over-year delinquencies increase. So, I was hoping Mark, you could just give us kind of sense of how to think about on a quarterly basis, what causes you to move your reserve up or down? Mark Graf : Sure. So today pre-CECL, we set our reserve base on expected losses on loans that are on the balance sheet now and it will be the losses we expect to see over the coming 12 months and the key really influencers of that level are going to be delinquency trends we see in the portfolio, macroeconomic trends and forecasts. Obviously, bankruptcy forecast what we see going on incident rates and what we see happening with consumer leverage and abilities to pay.Where \u2013 would be the key influencers I guess that will be out there today Mark and I think the other thing is we try and not to react with a knee-jerk reaction one quarter versus the next. So, when we see some goodness, we\u2019ve got a relatively flat reserve rate this quarter vis-\u00e0-vis last quarter, we saw a little bit of goodness in a couple areas. We\u2019re not just going to assume that represents a trend we\u2019re going to wait and see that developed and we\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re being prudent in how we think about trends in the portfolio as oppose to just knee-jerk reacting up and down.As we go into CECL environment I think that level of judgment will increase candidly but we will become far more sensitive to changes in macroeconomic forecast as well as the level of growth in the portfolio in a CECL environment as well, so that would be how to think about it now and really how to think about it going forward. Mark DeVries : Okay that\u2019s helpful. But then when we think specifically about this quarter versus last quarter, what did you see maybe differently in all those different things you evaluate that because you keep reserves mostly unchanged, is the reserve ratio versus last quarter where there\u2019s a more substantial increase. Mark Graf : I mean the reserve rates stayed relatively flat. I think we saw constructive activity on a quarter-over-quarter basis in delinquency trends. We saw constructive developments in quarter-over-quarter trends in charge off trends. Macro trends a little less clear candidly then we would have seen historically not relatively flat, but uncertainty around what the [indiscernible] is going on the with the fed quite honestly, would be entering into that process. Incident rates up a tad but nothing significant. I mean there\u2019s no question severity remains the primary driver.Consumer leverage pretty consistent so you kind of put all that into the blender and hit go, I suppose you could have gotten yourself comfortable with a modest reserve rate reduction, but we don\u2019t target a reserve rate again we set reserves based on the loans we see on the books and all those factors we talk about earlier and we want to see those factors develop over more than just a month or two. We actually want to see them develop into trends before we responded as trend because most importantly those reserves are meant to reflect the risk that we as a management team feel exist in the loan book today and not just to knee-jerk quarter-over-quarter based on things we see moving. Mark DeVries : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : This is Mihir for Jason. Just quick question on the purchase volume. Is there anything you would call out in terms of the Discover card purchase volume other than just the different category in reward because well you saw a little bit of slowdown this quarter? I think it was up 4.5% plus there\u2019s even 6.5% last quarter and so I was just wondering, is there anything particular there? Mark Graf : Couple of things, one when you look at us compared to competitors ours is explicitly more of a lend focus model versus spend focus because sometimes there\u2019s a bit of disconnect, part of it was just a challenging comp year-over-year. The switch in 5% category probably caused us roughly almost a point of growth, the other thing is gas prices can have an impact and so that also dampened our year-over-year sales growth. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you and then just, can you give us an update on the checking products, the one with the rewards. What kind of engagement are you seeing from the customers, is the population different that are attractive to this product, whether it\u2019s millennial versus your card product if you will and is there an opportunity to drive that growth a little further in the interest rate as you know, if the interest rate environment is we\u2019re expecting with the lower outside funds rate maybe and might see a little bit less yield chasing. Mark Graf : The benefits of checking compared to other products actually gets tougher in a lower rate environment just because in checking you\u2019re not paying interest, but you\u2019re paying OpEx and so as rates come lower the advantage of checking versus say saving starts to get compressed. We continue to be excited about how checking is performing, the average age of new customer is about 35, our card actually does well with students and millennial too, but we\u2019re excited about the product about a quarter of the new customers are also opening a savings account, so exciting about that, we\u2019re seeing good growth year-over-year in new account. So, it continues to be a good product for us but I would caution you, we view it as a long-term build before checking deposits become a meaningful piece of our funding. The role \u2013 the direct to consumer deposit portfolio is doing very well and as we mentioned on the call, it\u2019s not over half of our funding. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : I guess I have a question on loan growth obviously the card growth continues to be strong and the mix is actually improving to less promo. Could you just talk about what driving this window to be open for you for this long Roger and maybe you could also just talk about how you\u2019re incorporating the shift views on the macro and to the underwriting process? Roger Hochschild : We have not, I\u2019ll start with the back of that Sanjay. We haven\u2019t changed our views on macro, we continue to be at the margin tightening credit and nothing is changed there in terms of how we think about our card underwriting. I think the window is there, as long as we can execute around having a compelling value proposition in a very competitive environment and so we always target a healthy mix of loan growth coming from both new accounts as well as stimulating our existing card accounts. We\u2019re happy with how it\u2019s performing but we continue to see good opportunities as well. Mark Graf : And it continues to skew toward prime oriented solid growth Sanjay if you something you\u2019ll see in our Q as it comes out at the end of the quarter [indiscernible] front run a little bit, the percentage of accounts at or below 660 actually decreased to about 19% in the quarter. So, you\u2019re seeing the percentage of the book that\u2019s actually classified as subprime begin to shrink as well. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay and then just a follow-up for you Mark. I appreciate the commentary on the NIM in lower rates, so far but maybe you can just backing up a little bit more high level talk about deposit betas and how they may vary early in the process of rates going down versus later in the process because we were seeing that difference as we were going late into the rate rising cycle, so maybe you could just talk about those dynamics. Mark Graf : Yes sure. We typically it\u2019s not unusual for deposit pricing to continue increasing after market rates stop. So, we did see a little bit of that across the industry, more recently we\u2019ve seen decreases including some of our product book as well. We\u2019ve implemented rate decreases also. So last quarter when we talked Sanjay the cumulative beta through the cycle was 51, the cumulative through the cycle as we sit here today is 49. So at the end of the day obviously competitor actions will have a bearing on how we act and respond because we are trying to be relevant to the market, we continue to target that sixth to tenth kind of place in bank rate to offer real significant value but not to have rate due to leading proposition, so that\u2019s generally how I would think about it.On the NIM question more broadly, I guess what I\u2019d say is, I mentioned we did see a little bit of upside biased to the upside when we gave our guidance in, we\u2019re really seeing that be more likely right now I\u2019m guessing NIM could come in anywhere from call it five to 9 basis points roughly higher than 10.3 that was part of our initial guide. I think want to make sure folks don\u2019t overreact to the growth we\u2019ve seen in NIM and really make extrapolate that as well because we are asset sensitive still roughly 25 basis point increase by the fed on a 12-month forward basis takes about a basis point or two off a margin give or take. It\u2019s kind of the way to think about it and those treasuries we\u2019ve been buying to dampen our asset sensitivity also are \u2013 that lower yields than some other things as well.So, I mean we\u2019re doing the right things to prudently position the balance sheet. NIM is going to be clearly on the plus side of that guide with the biased to the upside but I don\u2019t want folks to runway and assume it\u2019s going to the moon either. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs Ryan Nash : When I look at credit broadly, so net charge offs year-to-date running kind of towards the bottom of the range 3Q historically it\u2019s seasonally strong for losses. Can you maybe just talk by-product, how you\u2019re feeling about the trajectory of losses and giving positive seasonality, could we end up coming in at or below the low end of your 3Q to 3.4 targeted range? Thanks. Mark Graf : Yes, I\u2019m not going to get into the trap of revising guidance on you on the credit one here, but I\u2019ll be happy to walk you through the parts of pieces. I would say, card Ryan continues to feel very stable and very good. I would say that from that perspective this is the seventh consecutive quarter, we saw the rate of increase in charge offs moderate year-over-year. The rate of growth moderate year-over-year, we still are seeing the impacts of normalization but it\u2019s down to roughly call it a quarter of the impact. The other three quarters is really coming from growth and as our loan growth has moderated a little bit, our guidance for the year is six to eight, as we\u2019re coming in closer to that six-ish percent kind of range so far, I would say that has bearing on that equation a little bit as well, so it feel to me at the end of the day like we\u2019re in a good shape with respect to trends in card charge offs. If we talk student loans that product has consistently just been a very solid credit performer for us. Don\u2019t see any signs of change on that horizon at all it just continues to feel decidedly solid I would say.Personal loans, too early to declare victory but it is looking like that 5% general soft guide we gave around personal loan charge off rates because of working through some of those segments that we talked about going back about a year or so ago. It looks like that was probably a little conservative, so I do think our personal loan charge offs will come in inside of that 5% number, you saw really positive quarter-over-quarter trends this time again I\u2019m not going declare a victory on the basis of quarter. But I do feel like things are trending well there as well. So not prepared to revise credit guidance at this point in time, but I would say we continue to feel really good about the trajectory of credit, the performance of credit and the health of the book. Ryan Nash : Got it and sorry to ask you another question on the net interest margin. But if I look year-to-date, you\u2019re running at close to 10.47, the guidance would impact about a 20-basis point fall off in the back half which is historically seasonally strong. So, I guess I just want make sure I understand all of the moving pieces given that, you\u2019re slightly asset sensitive, your better seasonality. But then you also have lower promo activity which is helping support the margin. So, if you just walk us through the puts and takes of how we end up with the margin, the back half of the year that\u2019s lower relative to the first half. Thanks Mark. Mark Graf : Yes, I\u2019ll do my best and I would not interpret this as being to be all inclusive but I\u2019ll give you some things to think about. So, as we head into the latter part of the year transact or engagement typically tends to pick up as we go into the holiday shopping season. So, you\u2019ll have a bigger percentage of the mix that essentially is effectively a 0% earning asset, so that has an effect \u2013 is there that you should be thinking about at the end of the day. The asset sensitivity depending upon the pace of the fed, the guidance we have implies right now. Our guidance would imply 25 coming up here shortly and 25 in the fourth quarter, if the pacing is greater than that, it would have a bigger impact and I already said 12-month forward a basis 0.1 or 0.2 for every 25 the way to think about that. Those portfolio purchases have a dampening effect of the treasury.On the promo piece, we don\u2019t expect that to continue to decline from its current levels. We\u2019re thinking the level we\u2019re sending that right now is a percentage of mix feels about right. So, you won\u2019t have further tailwind from promo at this point in time. So those will be some of the things I would generally would be thinking about Ryan it\u2019s not all inclusive but I\u2019m trying to send a balance message on NIM. It\u2019s clearly a good story it\u2019s going to end up higher than that 10.3 that we had talked about, but I don\u2019t want folks to think we\u2019re sandbagging and setting something up we it\u2019s going to moon either. I\u2019m trying to send a very balanced, very clear message there. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : My first question is on rewards and promotional activity. I know it\u2019s early in the quarter, but can you discuss whether include PayPal and this quarter\u2019s 5% cash back rewards category whether you had expect that to drive a pickup in volumes and how should we think about the sustainable rewards rate level, as we look ahead from here in light of the decrease that we saw this quarter. Roger Hochschild : Yes, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the decrease this quarter. We talked about how the categories can have a significant impact to Q-over-Q but that doesn\u2019t change our long-term perspective. We\u2019re very excited about the program with PayPal. They\u2019re a great partner, so but just given their overall scale I would say modest impact on rewards in the coming quarter. Mark Graf : On a full year basis, I would say we aren\u2019t moving that guide we gave for the year that 1.32 to 1.34 so it definitely does tend to move around based on how lucrative that category is. So, like in the first quarter, groceries it\u2019s really easy to max out on the $1,500 in spend. I think you have to spend $125 a week or something inside of that even to max out. It\u2019s really easy to do. Certain of the other categories it\u2019s not as easy to max out on that if you unless you\u2019re a high spend transactor. So, we do see variability based on that as well, but the guide for the year the 1.32 to 1.34 is still I think, how would be thinking about it. Bill Carcache : Got it. Thanks, helpful. Thanks Roger and Mark. My last question is regarding your digital investments and specifically on cloud you guys have talked about pursuing a hybrid cloud strategy versus the public cloud strategy that some of your competitors are pursuing. Can you discuss whether you have any concern that first of all you may be falling behind your competitors and secondly maybe if you could discuss what you\u2019re seeking to optimize with your strategy. Roger Hochschild : So, in terms of hybrid cloud versus sort of moving purely to the public cloud. I think our focus around technology, it was always technology to drive business value not technology for technology sake. I mean so we try and take a really practical view, so moving 100% of your applications to the public cloud, moving your general ledger. I might actually see the benefit. On some of the consumer facing applications we have migrated to the cloud and we\u2019ve written architecture, you\u2019re seeing 30% plus increases in feature delivery rate, so clear benefits from public cloud but we feel like our hybrid strategy is the right way to go.In terms of falling behind our competitors on technology. I maybe think more about what\u2019s the opportunity in front of us versus comparing because everyone\u2019s business a bit different. Certainly, we\u2019re doing a great job in business value, if you look at what we\u2019ve done to mobile space being number one rank there. But I\u2019m also excited about how quickly technology is changing and what we can do in the coming years. Bill Carcache : It\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Actually, most of my questions have been asked, so I just have one. Roger you referred to a good mix of sources of growth from new customers and increasing advances. Can you parse out that gives a little bit more information of the growth? How much of its coming from utilization versus advances versus new customers? Roger Hochschild : I\u2019d guess a bit more from new customers versus the portfolio so probably for the last roughly 18 months, we\u2019ve been close to that 60-40 range between the two, maybe a little higher this quarter. But again, a healthy mix, so it\u2019s consistent really with what we\u2019ve done for a while now. John Hecht : Okay and I guess it\u2019s related \u2013 how would you discuss the competitive environment, you guys have used the word competitive quite a bit, but has it leveled off, is there changing dynamics on competition for new customers and rewards or how do we think about that? Roger Hochschild : We said for a while that rewards competition has leveled off. Going back a couple of years it was just every quarter someone was out there with a hot new program, so it\u2019s stable. The card business is always very competitive. If you look at the returns and so it\u2019s really the same competitors pursuing it aggressively and that\u2019s just a constant state for the business. John Hecht : Great, thanks very much for the color. Operator : And your next question is from Vincent Caintic with Stephens. Vincent Caintic : Most of my questions have been answered or raised. So maybe just switching gears to the expense side, so on Slide 8 very helpful color on some of the expense growth. If you could talk about maybe in some more detail about information processing and the professional fees and other expenses those are up on the double-digit range. Is that something we should expect to continue going forward or is there one-time things and specifically for the investments infrastructure and capabilities maybe you could discuss that further into the deal. Thank you. Mark Graf : Sure, if you think about the information technology spend, I think that really is the battle field on which the bank of the future is being built quite honestly. So, I would not expect to see technology spend be something you\u2019d look to see [indiscernible] back on anytime soon. Obviously, we have a leverage there, if we were hit downturn a major bump in the road, something like that. But it feels like those investments are driving great returns, you\u2019re seeing it already in some of the performance in our personal loan book as we\u2019re able to better weed out some of the challenges we were faced with their if you will, you\u2019re seeing it across the board in the portfolio so we feel good about that.If you\u2019re talking about the professional fees, I think on that piece to the puzzle yes I believe there\u2019s some lumpiness to that ones I think you\u2019ll see that one continue to be exhibit a degree of lumpiness and I would not take that as an elevated run rate or something that I would expect to see on a normalized basis. On the other category that was up $28 million. I would say the variance there, it\u2019s about $11 million year-over-year due to global acceptance about $13 million and this year I think that it was about $2 million in it, last year same quarter something like that and about $9 million of that is driven by fraud reserve. We had a second quarter of 2018 last year we had a reserve release in the fraud reserve. This year second quarter we had a normal build driven consistent with loan and deposit growth.The end of the day those would be the big drivers in the other, other. So, continue to feel good about the expense guide broadly for the full year and continue to feel that there is significant untapped leverage in the expense base that we can avail ourselves of, if and when we see a shift in the environment. Roger Hochschild : And maybe to build off Mark\u2019s comment. You can see great stability in operating efficiency even as we made those increases in investments in technology and I think that reflects really our discipline around expenses that to the extent we need to make investments. We\u2019re going to look hard at everything and see how we can fund this. Mark Graf : And actually, we\u2019re at not to peak season DSL [ph] expenses that you incur, your efficiency ratio actually this quarter would have come in at 37.1. So, I think yes and I feel really good about the expense guide and I feel very good about the leverage that exist there. Vincent Caintic : Okay, got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank. Meng Jiao : A quick question just on M&A. I think earlier this year you guys spoke to \u2013 would be loving to do acquisitions at payment space, but you noted that valuations are high. I just wanted to get any sort of updated thoughts that you guys had in terms of M&A space whether it relates to payment space or direct US banking. Thanks. Roger Hochschild : I think the same comments still holds through, we love to do acquisitions in payments and valuations are still high. So, if you look back over the years both PULSE and Diners were transformational acquisitions in the payment side. But Mark and his team are on a very disciplined process and we\u2019re focused on value and making sure that transactions work out well for our shareholders. On the banking side there\u2019s probably a bit less to get excited about just buyer portfolios is it\u2019s like buying a bond and we\u2019re very happy with the presence we\u2019ve built in the products we\u2019re in on the consumer side. So, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily encourage you to think about any acquisitions on the direct banking side, we\u2019ll look at anything opportunistically but we feel good and I think quarter shows there\u2019s a lot we can do around organic growth. Craig Streem : Erica [ph]. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Chris Donat : I wanted to ask about the competitive environment for deposits because Mark I thought I heard you say that you have put some decreases in the product book and we\u2019ve seen Ally [ph] and the Marcus product from Goldman Sachs we\u2019ve seen some incremental reductions just trying to get a sense of how confident you feel that you can trim deposit rates without having any adverse impact. Mark Graf : So, I would say, that is always the $64,000 question. I think the real question out there is, where do you see it on a relative basis. Right. You have to be in the relevant range in the market place. I think do we have the ability to lead the market down in the terms of deposit pricing. No, I don\u2019t think we have the ability to lead the market down in deposit pricing we didn\u2019t lead it going up either. Do I feel like the betas that we\u2019ve built into our asset liability models and the guidance we provided around NIM and other things for the year continue to feel really good and do I feel like that is a business that continues overtime to look more and more like a traditional banks deposit business where there\u2019s real relationship, yes I do.I mean I think when I look most recently, I think we\u2019re just a hair shy of 70% of our depositors now have the relationship with us on the asset side of the balance sheet. Right, so I feel very good these are not hot money quasi-capital markets accounts and I feel very good about our ability in a declining rate environment to harvest some benefit there. Chris Donat : Okay, that makes sense. Then just kind of curiosity wise on the upper end of the competitive spectrum we\u2019ve seen. Robo-advisors like better manual front get a little more aggressive on deposit products using [indiscernible] traditional bank product, but using bank relationships to get FDIC \u2013 anyway you\u2019ve seen meaningful competition from there or is that really hitting kind of different part of the marketplace and you\u2019re targeting for deposits. Roger Hochschild : Yes, we haven\u2019t seen any impact from that. Chris Donat : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I was hoping to kind of talk a little bit to couple of questions before that competitions. Your marketing spend was flattish as you mentioned that rewards category in Q2 didn\u2019t had a lower level. I mean as you look in the second half, I mean is there an opportunity to take more share, to generate a little better growth in either lending or spending or both. Mark Graf : We tend to think about it in terms of the ROI for the marketing dollars we put out there. If you think product by product certainly seasonally, you\u2019re going to start seeing ramp up in Q3 given the peak for student loans. For personal loans, we were very explicit about trimming back from channels based on credit performance but also that we\u2019re starting to see the benefits from that in terms of the losses and the new generation of models going in. fourth quarter tends to be heavy for card, so yes I think you can expect to see us continue to invest and look to gain share particularly around student loans and card. Personal loans I think you want to not pursue share and growth there too aggressively that\u2019s really driven by return and we\u2019ve been very vocal over years now. There are times to market that product and there are times to cut back and we\u2019ll continue to be disciplined. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it, thanks and maybe just a follow-up for Mark. You\u2019ve always used capital markets funding in conjunctions with deposits and as we\u2019re getting into this declining rate environment and to the extent that the industry doesn\u2019t cut as fact. I mean would you kind of switch over to a greater degree of that capital markets funding. Mark Graf : I\u2019d say, I think about a little bit like a constrained optimization Moshe. At the end of the day I think over the long haul the value of a true relationship oriented deposit base can\u2019t be replicated so I would still have a bias that general direction. That being said, we\u2019re economically motivated and to the extend the cost of funding and the capital markets really started to gap out, sure. Be willing to do that at the end of the day. Subject to maintaining good discipline around asset liability management and make sure we\u2019re not doing anything that is near term beneficial, but plans land mines in the forward P&L when those things mature or reprice [ph], but sure be willing to consider. Moshe Orenbuch : Yes, thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Couple of questions, first for Mark. Just want to make sure, your commentary around for every 25 bps, 1.2 basis points that I think last quarter was four to six so just want to make sure I heard that right as well as just understand the [indiscernible] differential all the actions that you discussed earlier, is that 1.2 for the second half of the year or is that 3Q and so we should expect an even lower level of impact as we hit 4Q? Mark Graf : So, the four to six Betsy would have been predicated that goes back maybe two quarters ago and it\u2019s predicated on what the benefit would be from a rate increase. We\u2019re now looking at what the likely cost of a rate decrease would be and it wasn\u2019t symmetrical the way we built it, so you\u2019re looking at one to two basis points of cost to margin on a 12-month forward basis associated with a 25 basis point reduction and we\u2019re continuing to shift the asset sensitivity. So, I would expect overtime that will moderate from that current one to two basis points level as we continue to shift the positioning of the balance sheet. Betsy Graseck : Got it and that\u2019s against spot or that\u2019s against the forward curve. Mark Graf : That\u2019s against the forward curve. Betsy Graseck : Got it, okay. And then Roger question for you in the prepared remarks you were talking a bit about the European opportunity and how you saw some of that come through this quarter. Could you give us a sense as to, which kind of markets you\u2019re seeing the uptake the most rapidly and where you feel you are in terms of opportunity set here is, what we saw this quarter something that you can continue for a while or do you think anything in particular, hey this is more of a one quarter event. Roger Hochschild : I think for us probably a lot of focus is around Spain, but also the UK and Ireland. Some of the smaller markets we\u2019re seeing great success and exciting partnership. So, Bulgaria is another one highlight this really is a multi-year strategy different countries will link in and out, but it\u2019s a broad focus across Western Europe. Betsy Graseck : Okay so early innings because these are not necessarily new markets for you but they are new given the relationships that you extended recently it\u2019s an accelerating growth path, is that fair? Roger Hochschild : Yes, and some of them while, clearly, we\u2019re in hundreds of countries around the world, some of these reflect I would say step function changes in terms of merchant acceptance within those markets. Betsy Graseck : Okay, so we could see these paces continue as your relationships build out in these markets. Roger Hochschild : Yes. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Streem, your closing comments please. Craig Streem : Thanks Erica [ph]. Thank you all for your interest. We appreciate your queuing up with us in light of who else maybe out there this afternoon and anything else you need of course, feel free to come back to us. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2019 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Craig Streem : Thank you very much, Erica. And welcome everyone to this afternoon's call. I'll begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com.Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear on today's earnings press release and presentation.Our call today will include formal remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild, covering third quarter highlights; and then it's my pleasure to welcome John Greene, our new Chief Financial Officer, who will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. After John completes his comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up, so we can accommodate as many participants as possible.Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, Craig and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. As you can readily see from our results, we continue to deliver very sound fundamental performance this quarter, leading to net income of $770 million after tax or $2.36 per share with a robust return on equity of 26%. We achieved our key objectives for loan growth, net interest margin and credit performance, setting us up to finish the year on a very solid footing. But at the same time, the strength and profitability of our business allow us to make ongoing investments which could further enhance our competitive position in each of our products and enable us to achieve continued strong results.Looking at the key drivers, total loans were up 6% and credit performance remains strong across all of our products, reflecting our disciplined and underwriting new accounts and line management as well as the clear benefits of our continued investments in servicing and collection capabilities.Card receivables grew 7% this quarter, reflecting a healthy mix of volume from both new and existing customers and origination activity skewed more to higher yielding merchandise balances versus promotional balances. This demonstrates a positive degree of customer engagement while providing a favorable contribution to the overall net interest margin.Turning to our student loan business, growth remains strong this quarter and originations were in line with our expectations through the peak season. We're seeing an improvement in conversions driven by increasing awareness of the Discover brand in the student loan market and better customer experience at the front end.We're excited about our competitive position in private student lending and we remain confident in our ability to grow loans and gain market share despite competitive pressure. In personal loans, growth was in line with our expectations as we remain disciplined on originating loans that meet our return objectives. Credit performance continues to stabilize, reflecting the positive outcome from recent credit tightening and implementation of enhanced risk mitigation strategies.Overall, underlying credit trends continue to be favorable across our lending products with credit performance driven more by growth in receivables as compared to normalization of the back book. The U.S. consumer and the overall economy continue to look good with unemployment at a 50-year low and consumer sentiment at a high level as we enter the holiday season.This was also another quarter of strong growth in consumer deposits which past the $50 billion mark and are now over half of our total funding. We've been able to maintain deposit pricing in the middle of the pack and have been pleased with our ability to continue to attract cost-effective funding in a falling rate environment. We recently introduced our no fee commitment across our deposit products and while still early, we believe this has resonated with customers and is contributing to our deposit growth.Pretax income for our Payment Services segment increased 16%, primarily driven by strong volume growth from our PULSE business. The PULSE team continues to expand business with existing issuers and win new relationships through creative debit solutions that deliver meaningful value for partners.Additionally, we can see to make progress against our strategy to enhance global acceptance by investing in partnerships with local acquirers and adding network-to-network partners. This quarter, we added two acquirer partners in France, [indiscernible] and Ark\u00e9a as we continue to focus on acceptance in Western Europe. In addition, we're expanding acceptance in Africa with our partnership with Verve, a Nigeria based payments network that will provide acceptance in a number of African countries for Discover and our net-to-net partners such as RuPay and BC Card.To summarize the quarter, our performance once again demonstrates the strength of the Discover business model. Our commitment to providing an industry-leading experience to our customers and our disciplined approach to profitable growth and credit management continue to provide strong returns and long-term value to our shareholders.The economic environment remains favorable and we do not see that changing in the near-term. That said, it is likely that we are in the later stages of the economic cycle and we are continuing to manage origination, servicing and operational effectiveness with that very much in mind.Before I wrap up my section of our formal remarks, I want to acknowledge Mark Graf\u2019s retirement from Discover. Mark has been a valued colleague and leader since he joined the company in 2011 and will remain at Discover as an Executive Advisor until his retirement in early 2020. We wish Mark and his family the very best for the future.And now I want to take a moment to formally introduce our new CFO, John Greene. John brings significant experience in financial services including over eight years at HSBC where he held the role of CFO of their largest business unit retail banking and wealth management. And he also brings over 12 years of experience at GE. John held public company CFO roles at Willis Group Holdings where he was instrumental in a turnaround of the company and subsequent merger with Towers Watson and most recently John was CFO at the Biogen spin-off Bioverativ.John is joining Discover at an important time and brings very relevant capabilities and experience. I'm very excited about the impact I expect John to have here at Discover. And I'm sure you'll enjoy working with him.I'll now ask John to discuss our financial results in more detail. John Greene : Thank you, Roger. Before I begin, I wanted to say that I'm very excited to be part of the Discover team. My first month confirmed my initial view that I was joining a great organization. I'm looking forward to an exciting future with Discover as well as the opportunity to work with all of you.Now onto the business at hand. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on Slide 4. Looking at the key elements of the income statement, revenue growth of 6% this quarter was driven by loan growth of 6%, consistent with our expectation and a very solid 8% growth in net interest income. The 8% increase in provision for loan losses was mainly driven by the seasoning of newer vintages and to a lesser extent by the continued supply driven normalization in the consumer credit industry.Operating expenses were up 9% year-over-year due to higher compensation expense and investments in supportive growth and new capabilities. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.5%, reflecting $12 million benefit from the favorable resolution of a certain tax matters. Net income and EPS were up 7% and 15% respectively.Turning to Slide 5, loans increased 6% over the prior year, led by 7% growth in credit card receivables. Standard merchandise balances continued to be the primary driver of card receivable growth. While the contribution from promotional balances was minimal, reflecting our decision to reduce the level of growth from promotional activities over the past several quarters, roughly 60% of the increase in loan balance was from new accounts and about 40% from existing.Turning to student loans. Total loan balances were up 4% from the prior year. The organic piece of our student loan portfolio increased 9% year-over-year, reflecting our strong competitive position. Personal loan growth was in line with our expectations increasing 1% from the prior year, reflecting the previously mentioned slowdown in originations as we work through the development and testing of new underwriting models.Moving to payments volume. To the right on Slide 5, you can see the proprietary volume was up 6% year-over-year. In Payment Services, PULSE volume increased 5% over the prior year, driven by incremental volume from existing issuers, new issuers on the PULSE network and growth in our PINless products such as PULSE PAY Express and PULSE E-commerce. AribaPay drove the 30% increase in Network Partners volume while Diners Club volume was flat to the prior year.Moving to revenue on Slide 6, net interest income of $2.4 billion was up 8% from the prior year, driven by three factors. First, higher loan balances. Second, higher revolve rate this quarter and third, somewhat lower promotional balances in this year's quarter. Total noninterest income was $498 million in the quarter, down $3 million or 1% from last year's quarter. The principle drivers of the decline were lower net discounts and interchange revenue, partially offset by higher loan fee income.Drilling down a bit, net discounts and interchange revenue was $255 million in the quarter, down 9% as revenue from higher sales volume was more than offset by higher rewards costs. This was primarily due to adding PayPal to the 5% rewards category. Sales volume was up 4% from the prior year were 5% when normalizing for processing days, offsetting the decrease in net discounts and interchange revenue was an increase of $17 million or 17% in loan fee income. The increase was principally due to an increase in late fee occurrences as well as an adjustment in late fee pricing tiers.As shown on Slide 7, our net interest margin was 10.43%, up 15 basis points year-over-year and down four basis points sequentially. Relative to the third quarter of last year, the increase in NIM was due to a favorable promotional balance mix and higher revolve rate. These were partially offset by higher brokered and direct-to-consumer deposit costs and by higher interest charge-offs. Compared to the second quarter, NIM decreased principally due to the roll-off of lower coupon brokered and direct-to-consumer deposits, along with the impact of prime rate decreases in July and September.Partially offsetting this was a favorable funding mix, a higher revolve rate and lower interest charge-offs. Total loan yield increased 31 basis points from a year ago to 12.76% driven by increases in yields for all of our principle loan products, 29 basis points in card, 35 basis points in private student loans and 51 basis points in personal loans.Card yield benefited from the impact of the 2018 prime rate increases, favorability in the revolve rate and a lower level of promotional balances which were partially offset by higher interest charge-offs and the impact of recent prime rate decreases. The year-over-year increase in student loan yield was primarily driven by higher short-term interest rates as about 60% of the portfolio is floating rate.The increase in personal loan yield was also driven by the impact of prime rate increases in the prior year as well as positive pricing actions. We expect to see a degree of yield compression from recent cuts in the Fed funds rate, which won't entirely be offset by lower funding costs. We have taken action by steadily reducing our asset sensitivity and consider our interest rate risk position to be essentially neutral at this point.Looking ahead, we expect to maintain this interest rate risk position for the foreseeable future. Our outlook anticipates one more 25 basis points rate reduction in 2019. On the liability side of the balance sheet, average consumer deposits grew 19% from last year and now make up 53% of total funding. Consumer deposit rates decreased four basis points from the prior quarter and 28 basis points above the prior year.Importantly, we've been able to achieve strong deposit growth while maintaining a disciplined pricing strategy. Since the Fed began raising rates in 2015, we realized a 51% cumulative deposit price beta for online savings. Of course, the Fed has recently cut its target rate by 50 basis points and we've responded by lowering our deposit rates where they realize beta of 50% on our savings accounts over the last few months. We will continue to manage deposit costs prudently taking into account competitors' behavior.Turning to Slide 8, total operating expenses rose $92 million from the prior year. Employee compensation increased $31 million, driven by staff additions in technology and other areas to support business growth as well as higher average salaries and benefits. Increased investments in new account acquisitions across our deposits, student lending and card products drove marketing cost up 6% from the prior year. The 8% increase in information processing reflects our continued investment in infrastructure and analytic capabilities. Professional fees were $23 million higher with a little over half of that due to increased collection costs related to higher recoveries in the quarter.Now I'll discuss our credit results on Slide 9, total net charge-offs were up eight basis points from the prior year. The increase continues to be primarily driven by the seasoning of loan growth and supply driven credit normalization. Credit card net charge-offs were 18 basis points higher year-over-year and down 17 basis points from the prior quarter. The credit card 30 plus delinquency rate was up 18 basis points year-over-year and up 16 basis points sequentially. Credit performance and the card business continues to be very solid, reflecting our disciplined approach to credit management in both new and existing accounts.Private student loan credit performance also remains strong with net charge-offs down 37 basis points year-over-year and two basis points sequentially aided by efficiency gains in collection, including enhanced communication and outreach to co-signers. Personal loan net charge-offs decreased 10 basis points from the prior year and 34 basis points sequentially.The significant improvement from the prior quarter reflects a degree of seasonality in originations and charge-offs that 30 plus delinquency rate was down eight basis points year-over-year and flat to the prior quarter, as credit performance continues to stabilize. Looking at capital on Slide 10, just a brief comment here. Common equity Tier 1 ratio remains sequentially flat at 11.4%, our capital payout ratio for the last 12 months including buybacks was 79%.Now summarizing our results for the quarter on Slide 11, we generated 6% total loan growth and a 26% return on equity. Our consumer deposit business saw strong growth of 19% and now composes over half our total funding. With respect to credit while our charge-off rates have increased as loan growth seasons and credit conditions normalize, performance reflects positive trends across our lending products and remains consistent where their expectations and return targets.We continue to execute on our capital plan with loan growth and capital return, helping to bring our capital ratios closer to targeted levels. Finally, we remain on track for a strong finish to 2019, achieving all aspects of our financial and operational guidance.In conclusion, this was a great quarter with solid execution by the team. Now before I go to Q&A, I wanted to say again how excited I am to be part of the Discover team. I look forward to helping the business continue its history of strong execution as we grow this great franchise.With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator, Erica to open the lines for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Yes, thank you. Roger, I was hoping you could comment on significance of today's announcement around Click to Pay and what you think it could mean for the business? Roger Hochschild : So in terms of the announcement on SRC, we are very excited as a member of EMVCo to be part of that. I think it's really fundamentally going to be great for consumers. It reflects the industry moving forward to significantly enhance the online checkout experience. I think it'll be a great step forward. So we're very excited to be part of it. Mark DeVries : Okay. In terms of just what it can mean though in terms of volumes or defending market share, anything else you could share on that? Roger Hochschild : I think it\u2019s probably too early to talk about share shift, but to the extent that we\u2019re working with other networks on a seamless integrated customer experience. We think that\u2019ll help our cardholders and be good for our business. Mark DeVries : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good afternoon. Roger Hochschild : Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Two questions related, Roger just wanted to understand, you had a really strong quarter on the revenue side and the expense ratio came in nicely as well, but it looks like there was a little bit of investment spend going on the quarter. How should we think about that? Is there a kind of expense ratio you\u2019re looking to run between? Or was this just a quarter where you had an opportunity to invest a little bit more and so you opt the investment spend this quarter or should we expect this level of investment spend to continue from here? Roger Hochschild : We don\u2019t necessarily target in an efficiency ratio to the point you are making, our investment spend, as we see opportunities to drive loan growth consistent with our conservative approach to credit, we will do so. And we think more in terms of overall returns. Our efficiency ratio is one of the best within financial services, but in terms of overall expense levels, those can vary based on the marketing investment. Betsy Graseck : And then as we think about the NII and the NIM, I think John you were mentioning that you are largely neutral and you\u2019ve got one more rate cut baked into your outlook. But we should expect NIM comes down a little bit. So I\u2019m just trying to square that and maybe get a little bit of more understanding as to what you\u2019re expecting over the next couple of quarters from a NIM perspective. John Greene : Certainly, happy to take that. So we ended the third quarter year-to-date results with a NIM rate at 10.45%. And then as we look at the fourth quarter, there\u2019s really three things that are going to impact it. So certainly the rate cuts that occurred throughout 2019 will be fully baked in. And then we\u2019ll have our funding rate, which actually ticked up mildly. And then of course in the fourth quarter, there\u2019s transactor and revolver mix shifts that ultimately will impact the rate.So I know the company gave some guidance at 10, 10.3, and then it was subsequently revised upward by 5 basis points to 9 basis points. I would expect based on what we\u2019re seeing here looking at the fourth quarter to come in probably at the higher end of that and probably 1 basis point or 2 basis points higher than 10.39, so probably 10.4-ish. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Yes. Roger, so looks like the card business is hitting on a lot of cylinders, credits, pretty stable, competition stable, demand is decent from the consumer. I guess I wanted to just get your thoughts on whether or not you see any risks to that in the near-term. Obviously, we\u2019re all focusing on the back row, but for example, is your sense that the delinquency rate year-over-year is going to continue to be in this sort of zip code, and if you\u2019re seeing any type of movement within segments of higher end to mid prime? Roger Hochschild : Yes. So we spend a lot of time looking for turns in the economy, looking at our portfolio kind of every way we can cut it whether it\u2019s a geographically, we look at the different vintage buckets, et cetera. And as I said on the call that the U.S. consumer is holding up well. I think part of it is reflected in terms of the fifth-year low in unemployment. But we remain disciplined and conservative and credit, because it feels late cycle and certainly is by any historic measure. But in terms of what you see in consumer behavior and the numbers we\u2019ve reported the consumer is holding up very well. Don Fandetti : And then I guess if you look around at the other networks, there\u2019s a lot of talk about B2B. We\u2019re seeing a lot of bolt-on acquisitions for the payment companies. Where you in terms of your thought process on B2B, I know you have a small business card that\u2019s pretty modest. And then do you think you need to make any type of bolt-on acquisitions at this point are you in good shape? Roger Hochschild : So in terms of B2B, we\u2019re always looking at opportunities, but I think we tend to think about it in terms of a mix of acquisitions but also partnerships. So we see a lot of B2B volume coming through our partnership with SAP and Ariba. We announced a new B2B space partnership this quarter. So it\u2019s an area we\u2019re focused on. Margins tend to be a little thinner on the B2B side compared to the B2C payments. But it\u2019s an area that we focused on for quite a while in the payments part of our business. Don Fandetti : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. I guess I\u2019ve got a question on the private student loan credit quality, and the nice improvement in the reserve right there. Obviously, we\u2019ve seen some pretty significant improvement in the charge-off rate and the associated coverage with the reserve came down quite a bit. Is it just a reflection of the delinquency rate trajectory and you expect that to continue and sort of what\u2019s driving that improvement? John Greene : Sanjay, this is John. I\u2019ll take that. So we\u2019re really pleased with the performance there. And first of all, the book is really solid. About 90% of the portfolio has co-signers. And in the first quarter of this year, the collection team began a outreach to co-signers when there was a early stage delinquency. And that\u2019s actually made a pretty substantial difference and collection effectiveness and overall delinquency levels. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. I guess question for Roger sort of similar to what Don was asking. I guess the ROEs have been really, really strong. And I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re surprised at how strong they are given where we are in the cycle. It seems like with such high returns you\u2019d have more competition, but there hasn\u2019t been a whole lot. So I\u2019m just curious how to reconcile. Is it something you guys are doing differently that\u2019s generating these returns? Or is it just at the competitive intensity is weaker because where this fought late into a cycle? Roger Hochschild : Yes, I probably would challenge the view that there isn\u2019t much competition in the card space. If you look at the players who are in it and the investments they make, I think part of it is, it is a very challenging business. So you tend not to see too many new entrance, but it is very competitive. And I think there\u2019s a difference between the marginal return that competitors look to as they think about how to grow their book and the total return. But I think the credit card business has been one of the highest returning consumer asset classes for my 25 years in the business. And I think it reflects just sort of some of the challenges and operating it well and we have a very discipline model here at Discover. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. I wanted to welcome and congratulate John on his new position and just one quick clarification. The NIM guidance that you provided was that a fourth quarter guide or was that for the full year? John Greene : That was fourth quarter. So when we come out with yearend results in January, we\u2019ll provide updated guidance for 2020. Sanjay Sakhrani : All right, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric Wasserstrom : All right, thanks very much. So just to circle back on the credit discussion for a moment. Certainly the NCO trends seem very contained and the delinquency trends also seem to be very contained in terms of the rate of change. On the other hand, the late fees are creeping up. That\u2019s often a harbinger of a future credit deterioration. You guys have talked a little bit about what you\u2019re doing on mod. So I\u2019m just trying to put the whole picture together. Is the characterization that it\u2019s stable, but with a slow slope towards deterioration, or how should I think about it? Roger Hochschild : Yes. I think I would probably highlight more of the stable side, part of what\u2019s driving up late fees is just overall growth in the portfolio. And certainly that\u2019s going to drive more delinquent accounts. But as you look at the overall delinquency rates and the trajectory those have been on, I think those reflect strong performance in a continued stable economic environment. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Thank you for that. And if I may just follow-up just quickly on NIM as well, without pushing you to provide point guidance which is not my intent. But I think in the past, what you\u2019ve indicated is every incremental 25 basis points reduction is 1 to 2 points of annualized NIM reduction. And so as we just think through whether it\u2019s our own economist or the Blue Chip consensus in terms of the 2020 expectation. Is that still a good framework to consider on the basis of the fourth quarter endpoint. John Greene : Eric, it is 1 to 2 basis points for every 25 basis points downward. Eric Wasserstrom : Great, thanks very much. Roger Hochschild : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good afternoon, guys. And John, congrats on joining Discover. John Greene : Oh, thank you. Ryan Nash : Roger, maybe I\u2019ll start with a similar question that some of the others have asked. So you\u2019ve been tightening credit for two years, yet you\u2019re still growing above the market. So one, do you think this could continue? And two, what do you think that you\u2019re doing different from the market now that\u2019s allowing you to continue to take share? Roger Hochschild : I feel good about the credit decisions we\u2019ve made and there are a mix of what we do for new accounts, but also for the portfolio. A lot of it has to do with differentiation. And so we focused a lot on innovation. So if you think about going back to the FICO score on statements, the ability to freeze your card, Cashback Match continues to perform well for us. And then also focusing on a superior customer experience. We\u2019ve won the J.D. Power Award for five of the last six years. We have the best mobile app in the business.So really that yes, relentless focus on every part of the customer experience. And then wrapping that with the Discover brand, which obviously having our own proprietary network helps us in terms of building that brand and providing differentiation. So yeah, I think the whole business model is focused on driving high quality loan growth. Ryan Nash : Got it. Maybe one for John last quarter or the end the quarter before the company had outlined the upfront impact regarding CECL. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the day two impact. How to think about the impact for a company that\u2019s experiencing nice growth yet still seeing supply driven normalization in a very uncertain macro backdrop. Thanks. John Greene : Yes, thank you. Good question. So let me start by saying that we\u2019re looking at CECL and the impact pretty extensively. We have now three quarters of simulations. We expect the overall reserve rate to be somewhere between 55 and 65 in the two most recent quarters that it\u2019s trending to the north end of that. We\u2019ll continue to monitor that and it will be impacted by the composition of the portfolio and certainly macro factors. So none of that is probably new to the folks on the call.In terms of the volatility, it is \u2013 it does drive a level of volatility. And we are \u2013 frankly I\u2019m holding off on giving a quantification on the volatility until we that down the estimates and clearly have a view of what the portfolio will look like and also the macro economics. So it will be more volatile. And we\u2019ll provide disclosures. They provide a clear view on an apples to apple basis, so non-GAAP disclosures that will align to 2019 GAAP, so let there\u2019s comparability. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. Roger Hochschild : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from David Scharf with JMP Securities. David Scharf : Yes, thanks for taking my questions and welcome aboard, John. Maybe a couple more questions on the credit side, maybe more hypothetical. We\u2019re \u2013 listen, we\u2019re obviously closing it on four years of everybody wondering whether we\u2019re in the eighth or ninth inning of this cycle and the data has suggested otherwise. But I\u2019m wondering two things, just hypothetically, whether this occurred in one quarter or six quarters from now.If you had any indicators whether internally based on delinquency trends or even macro indicators, suggesting we\u2019re heading towards let\u2019s say a 5.5% to 6% unemployment environment, which is consistent with two recessions ago, going to ignore the great recession. Trying to get a sense, and I realize there are so many variables and inputs, but generally speaking from a strategic standpoint, should we be thinking about Discover is a business that is still targeting some level of loan growth in the midst of that kind of environment, sort of flat or year-over-year decline. I realize it\u2019s very hypothetical just trying to get a sense for how to think about at this stage of maturity how the business operates in that type of macro backdrop. Roger Hochschild : Yes. I can\u2019t really sort of comment on exactly how much we grow at what unemployment level. I would say though that is, we look at the new accounts we book and the models that John and the finance team do. We use the through the cycle of loss rate as opposed to where we are at any given point in time. And we\u2019ve spent a lot of time analyzing accounts that we book through the last downturn. The vast majority of our new accounts we would have booked in December of 2007.So even going into that time, even if we had known what was coming, the vast majority of accounts would have booked. There are certain segments that are sort of more in the near prime side that are more volatile. And so those tend to be where you cut back, you cut back on the number of line increases you do, and there are other actions on the portfolio. But again, most \u2013again, the vast majority of those new accounts, we use the through the cycle loss rate and book in a much more challenging credit environment than what we have next. David Scharf : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just a follow-up along those lines, once again, this is hypothetical, but maybe it\u2019s something you could quantify for us. If the loan book in aggregate starting today, I mean the back book today were to be flat over the next 12 months. Is there any sense you could give us in basis points of how much upward pressure on loss rates just the pure seasoning would exert if we no longer had any contributing denominator effect? Roger Hochschild : That\u2019s something we really couldn\u2019t put together. I mean we don\u2019t run a scenarios of our loan book flat, because we\u2019re going to keep trying to grow it. But I really can\u2019t answer that. David Scharf : Got it. Fair enough. Thanks very much. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Look the uptake on the rewards program that PayPal was very strong during the quarter. I\u2019m curious if you could help us understand tactically what the intent of that program is. Is it a demographic drive from millennials or is there something else we should be thinking about? Roger Hochschild : Sure. So a lot of our programs do in fact target millennials. PayPal is a great business partner both on our issuing side as well as on the payment side. And with some merchants like PayPal, you do get a bit of a lock in, because once people change their default card, they are tends to be a tail of sales. So we\u2019re always looking for how to use our rewards dollars to cost effectively drive growth and provide value for our customers. I think it's one of the advantages we have from the structure of our rewards program. And so that was an investment we made and we're excited about what we're seeing in terms of cardholder pickup of that. Rick Shane : Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for answering the question. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good afternoon. I had a couple of follow-up questions. First a follow-up on Rick's PayPal 5% category question. Can you give any kind of early indication of the stickiness of those customers post promo, just trying to get a sense for the willingness of those customers to keep discover as their primary card after the promotion ends versus, how much gaming behavior you're seeing? Roger Hochschild : I will comment specifically. I would say we've had a lot of experience running our 5% promo and know kind of by each different category of what type of tail we spend and that goes into the targeting. So, I'll go back to saying we're very excited about how it's performed and we think we're getting good value for our investment. Bill Carcache : Okay. Thanks, Roger. And then another follow-up on Ryan's question about the day two impact of CECL, at a high level, is it reasonable to expect that the building of reserves on future growth under CECL would also increase by the 55% to 65% that you guys have guided to versus what it would have been under the incurred loss model? Roger Hochschild : Yes. So great question. So no, to be specific on that. So the portfolio when we're putting up the 55% to 65% increase for day one reflects a maturity of the portfolio that already has some incurred losses reflected in it. So when you put up new loan accounts, what happens is you have to book the lifetime losses and therefore the impact is actually greater than the day one impact of 55% to 65% that we've talked about. Bill Carcache : Okay. So it's like as a starting point in 55% to 65% day one impacted, the day two impact on the incremental building would actually be larger than that. John Greene : It would for new loan account. And then obviously the macro factors would come into play there, that the type of assets we're putting on the books. So are they credit card or personal loans will impact. So there is a lot of factor. And as I said, I'm going to hold off on giving a specific number until we get it sorted out. We've got more work to do as an organization, but we're progressing well on it. And in the first quarter, we'll share that. Bill Carcache : Got it. Thanks, John. Welcome to the team and I look forward to working with you. John Greene : Thank you much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Bob Napoli : Thank you. And I'll also welcome you, John, look forward to working with you as well. First question is just on the direct deposits. The growth of direct deposits has been so strong and it is by far your lowest cost of funds. And I just \u2013 if you could have any thoughts around what percentage of your funding over the long-term could be through direct deposits because that's a nice tailwind obviously to your business, to your margins. John Greene : Yes. So it is. So what we do is we concentrate on the overall funding stack and obviously it's really important to make sure we have the right level of liquidity and other funding sources in place. But with that said, as we mentioned on the prepared comments, 53% of this funding stack was from deposits. We'd like to grow that. And I think the previous guidance the business has given was in the medium term somewhere around 60%. And we'll look at that as a path forward and we may adjust upward if conditions wants. Bob Napoli : Thank you. And follow-up call on Roger, on the competitive front. I mean you do have, one you have an Apple Card and just your thoughts around that. And then we've had some mega mergers in the payment space and they're looking for revenue synergies. And one area that one company feels like is low hanging fruit is would be related to the PULSE business. And so I just want to \u2013 if you could comment on the Apple and, and then the mega mergers and the ability of your to be able to continue to grow your payments business. John Greene : Yes. In terms of the, the Apple Card, we've yet to see that have a noticeable impact on our volumes. So we're watching it carefully, but again no noticeable impact. In terms of the mega mergers on the payment side a, if we compete against Visa and MasterCard, so we're used to competing against very large companies and payments. A lot of it is \u2013 it's sort of a broader ecosystem where there are, in fact partnership opportunities with some of those companies as well. So, at present it's too early to understand this, the full impact on PULSE, but our goal is to be able to compete globally against anyone in the payments industry. Bob Napoli : Great. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Chris Donat : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I had one on the professional fees and the increase in them. And does that represent some sort of change in how you're doing collections? Like are using rather than first party or in-house collections are using more third party collections or is it just something else going on there? John Greene : Chris, thanks for the question. No. what actually you see there is a pretty substantial increase in overall recovery. So recoveries third quarter 2019 versus third quarter 2018 are up about 32%. So that drives obviously a bit of the \u2013 I'll call it commission for the third-party collectors. Chris Donat : Okay. Got it. And then just one more on CECL. As you talk about the volatility's you get more experienced with the sort of the parallel run of CECL, does that affect how you might be thinking about capital in 2020 and beyond of maybe needing to have a little more pressure and recognizing that there's a phase in from a regulatory perspective for CECL? Or is that too soon to tell? John Greene : Yes. So there will be a capital impact, right? The phase in is 25% over four year period. It doesn't change the underlying cash flows of the business. So we're going to continue to try to optimize the capital base and we're progressing excluding CECL towards a target level of 10.5% So we'll present a capital plan to the board and to the regulators and see what that looks like in 2020. Chris Donat : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Thanks very much. Welcome, John. Most of my questions were asked, maybe going to dive a little bit into the consumer behavior. So for new customers that you're attracting at this point, are they more \u2013 are they reacting more to zero balance transfers, or what are the promotional factors are \u2013 you're having heavy reactions at this point? John Greene : We always try and bring in cardholders that are not just balanced transfer active, but use their card as well. And so the cash back match continues to perform very well for us. But that probably is the other thing that's impacting new customers. But again, we focus on customer experience. We focus on line assignment, every component is important. But I'd probably highlight that cash back max is sort of the biggest thing we have for new cardholders. John Hecht : Okay. And you mentioned the lines that the \u2013 any changes to utilization rates? Are those behaviors been pretty consistent as well? John Greene : We haven't \u2013 I'll go back. We have not picked up signs of distress in our portfolio as we look. John Hecht : So utilization rates just stable as expected? John Greene : Yes. John Hecht : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank. Meng Jiao : Hi, good afternoon guys. Quick question on I guess a loan growth, just from simple back the envelope math, I mean loan growth and need to I guess, accelerate have been 4Q to reach that low end of that six to eight prior guidance range. I'm wondering if you guys could provide any color on it and do you still expect that to be true or, and where are you seeing the most strength there? Thanks. John Greene : I won't comment on the guidance. I would say if you look at the quarter, we feel very good about our card loan growth. We feel good about how student loans perform in the peak season. And we had talked about really a lower growth rate for personal loans in terms of expectations for this year, as we tested our new credit models for some segments that had not performed as well as we wanted. We're excited about how those are doing as well. So again, we feel good about our ability to achieve loan growth. It'll of course depend on the holiday season. But so far consumers seem to be in a pretty good space. Meng Jiao : Gotcha. Great. And then my second question is just on overall international acceptance, I think, mid quarter you mentioned that international acceptance was somewhere in the seventh inning. And I know in your prepared remarks you mentioned focusing more on Africa as well as Western Europe. I like to get any sort of updated thoughts you had there in terms of innings and how you see discover progressing internationally going forward? John Greene : You know, the seventh inning is quite long. We may go to extra innings. So maybe that, that's not the best way to phrase it. It will be a continued investment and I think Africa just gives you an example of the breadth of our investments. We're also working with network partners everywhere from Eastern Europe to Asia to South America. A particular focus has been on Western Europe and working with acquirers there. So you heard us announce a number of partnerships, so we will continue to build out our global acceptance footprint. Meng Jiao : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Foran with Autonomous. Brian Foran : Hi, good evening. John Greene : Hi, Brian. Brian Foran : Maybe just on the deposit betas, the 50% so far was interesting and I think most of the traditional banks are struggling to get, 15% 20% beta so far. Is your feeling that that's a timing issue, i.e., it's easier for you and peers to lower the online deposit rates and reprice most of these most of the book quickly? Or are you more encouraged that, maybe the betas could just be higher on online deposits throughout a fed easing cycle? John Greene : Yes, I mean, I think if you compare to a lot of the more traditional brand space things, they tend to have a lower beta. A lot of it has to do with their product mix. And so having more in checking or in savings accounts and are paying in the \u2013 sometimes in the single digit basis points, they pay through operating expenses as opposed to the rate. So, I think there's a natural symmetry between the betas you experienced on the way up and what you have on the way down. And so a lot of those banks captured the rate increases on the way up and didn't move their rates much at all, but unfortunate it doesn't give you much room to adjust when rates are coming back down. Brian Foran : Got it. And then two small things on the, one on the loan fees, when you referenced the changes that drove it to 120 versus kind of around 105 before, does it all else equal stay around 120 or does it go back to 105 as we think about putting something in the model going forward. John Greene : So that's a function of the late payments and also the pricing tiers that we put in place. So, I would expect a little, certainly a tick up based on history, but some of it will be tied obviously to late payments and in that, you'll be able to see the trends there. Brian Foran : And then, I hate to ask for a clarification up the clarification of the NIM guidance, but I managed to get myself tripped up when you were kind of saying a basis point or two above deal, 10.39 high end that was for the full year, we should think about 10.40? John Greene : Yes. Thanks for that clarification question. Yes, it would be for the full year. Brian Foran : Okay. So 4Q 10.3% plus or minus is, is kind of the implied output of that? John Greene : Yes. You solve the math and\u2026 Brian Foran : I wouldn't put a lot of trust in that, so I figured I'd ask. I appreciate it. Thank you. John Greene : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Mahir [ph] on for Jason. Thanks for taking my questions. And firstly, congratulations John, on joining the team up. The first question, I think if I could go back where we started, I guess back to the quick to pay or the unified payment, button and I was just curious, will you be putting any promotional efforts around getting your cardholders to enroll their Discover cards or make them default in on that button? John Greene : I think we're in the early stages of implementation, clearly we try and make sure that our cardholders are using Discover and I think this is where there may be an advantage for us in terms of our integrated network and card issuer model. We can enable it probably more seamlessly than, someone who uses a third-party issuer. You know, as an example, we were the first ones to be able to provision Apple Pay from within our app. So we'll look for opportunities where we can make the experience more seamless for Discover card holders. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks for that. And then just around \u2013 I just had a question around credit and just your net charge-off guidance. I think you've mentioned 3.2% to 3.4% for the year. And I was just doing the rough math here, looking at of how you perform the year-to-date, is there a potential for it to come in a little better than that or are you sticking with, or at least the very low end of that? Just because, I mean, it sounds like you're pretty favorable on credit and looking at year-to-date performance and Q3 performance, it need to be pretty meaningful quarter-over-quarter degradation to get, but the higher end of that, certainly. John Greene : Yes. So thanks for that. So yes, the guidance was 3.2% to 3.4% and we're certainly performing at the lower end of that. At this point I'll probably just pause there and say that lower end of the guidance and if you choose to put something else in your model be comfortable with it. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our final question from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Jon Arfstrom : Thanks. Good afternoon. John Greene : Good afternoon. Jon Arfstrom : Great. Just a quick one on deposit growth. Curious if you had to put your finger on what's driving it, would you say that new deposit account growth is tracking with overall deposit account growth or using something like higher average balances on existing accounts or is it both, if that makes sense? John Greene : Yes. No, it's both. So we're attracting new customers, but we're also seeing some of our existing customers build their balances, whether it's adding another CD or just putting more money into the savings accounts. So it's a mix of both from new as well as existing customers. Jon Arfstrom : Okay. All right. Thank you.There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Streem, your closing comments, please? Craig Streem : Thanks, Erica. Thank you all for your attention, for your questions. And you know where to find us for any follow-up. Thanks. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter 2019 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Craig Streem : Thank you, Erika. Welcome everyone to this afternoon. We will begin as usual on Slide 2 of the earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations Web site, investorrelations.discover.com.Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear on today's earnings press release and the presentation. Our call today will include formal remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild, covering 2019 full year and fourth quarter highlights. And then John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through the rest of the earnings presentation. And when John completes his comments, there will be plenty of time for a Q&A session. And please limit yourself, if you don't mind, to one question and one follow up so we can accommodate as many participants as possible.Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, Craig. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'll begin by reviewing the highlights and key performance metrics for the full year. Then turn the call over to John to review fourth quarter results as well as our guidance elements for 2020.2019 was another very good year for Discover with net income of $3 billion after tax or $9.8 per share, and a healthy return on equity of 26%. These results reflect our business model that brings together the positive attributes of high return consumer lending and direct banking with the benefits and long-term potential of owning our own global network. Our robust returns allowed us flexibility to return excess capital to our shareholders, while continuing to make important investments in the Discover brands' advanced technology and expanding our acceptance globally. These investments have further strengthened our competitive position in 2019, and set us up for continued strong returns in 2020 and beyond.Looking at some of the specifics. Total loans grew 6%, in line with our expectations. And credit performance was also on target, as we benefited from the continued strength of the U.S. consumer and ongoing advances in our risk management and servicing capability. We achieved a robust net interest margin of 10.41%, and operating expenses remained in our targeted range. The economists are forecasting continued growth in the economic environment in 2020. However, given the unprecedented duration of the economic expansion, we will manage credit with that in mind.We continue to invest in our global payments business in 2019, focusing on expanding acceptance by adding network partners and relationships with acquirers in key markets like the UK, New Zealand, France and Spain. Our payment services segment generated 24% increase in pretax income, primarily driven by strong volume gains from our PULSE business. The team at PULSE had a great year, adding volume from acquirers and both existing and new issuers.Turning Slide 4, we had solid loan growth in all our products, with total loans and card loans both up 6%. In our card business, the majority of this growth was in higher yielding merchandise balances as opposed to promotional activity, reflecting strong card member engagement. We continue to introduce features and service enhancements that are relevant to customers and prospects, including for example, leveraging merchant partnerships to provide even greater value to our partners.We also had a good year in our student lending business, with organic receivables up 9%. Loan growth is benefiting from increased awareness of the Discover brand, enhancements through acquisition models and improvements in the conversion process. We continue to benefit from our strong position as the second largest provider for private student loans.Our personal loan portfolio grew 3% in 2019, a touch above our expectations. Our investments in analytics and modeling have had a significant impact on our personal loan credit performance, enabling us to increase originations, while maintaining an acceptable level of credit risk.Turning to Slide 5, credit performed very well in 2019 and was in line with our expectations. The seasoning of loans from recent vintages was the primary driver as the impact of normalization in the consumer credit industry continues to abate. As I said earlier, we feel good about the underlying economic and credit trends as we enter 2020, and we'll have more to say about overall credit environment when we discuss fourth quarter performance and 2020 guidance later in the call.Before I turn the call over to John, I want to wrap up by saying how excited I am about our prospects for continuing to create value for Discover's customers, team members and shareholders. We finished 2019 on very solid footing, generating outstanding returns by combining solid loan growth and effective credit risk management. I'll now ask John to discuss our financial results in more detail. John Greene : Thank you, Roger and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on Slide 6, looking at key elements of the income statement. Revenue, net of interest expense, increased 5% this quarter, driven primarily by 6% increase in average loans. Provisions for loan losses increased 5%, mainly driven by loan growth and to a lesser extent by ongoing supply-driven normalization in the consumer credit industry. Operating expenses were up 7% due to higher compensation expense and continued investments to support growth in collections, digital platforms and advanced analytics.Moving to Slide 7. Roger already covered the key loan metrics. But I wanted to emphasize that the majority of the growth in card receivables came from standardized merchandise balances, with a smaller contribution from promotional balances. We expect merchandise balances will continue to be a primary driver of card growth in 2020. Just under 70% of the increase in receivables was from new accounts with the remainder from existing cardholders. Looking at student loans, total receivables were up 3% from the prior year with the organic student loan portfolio increasing 9% year-over-year.Turning to Slide 8. Volume on the Discover network rose 5% from the prior year, in line with growth in the Discover card spending. Within our payment services segment, PULSE volume increased 6% over the prior year, driven by strong performance in key product.Moving to Slide 9. Net interest income of $2.4 billion increased $122 million or 5% from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher loan balances, a higher revolve rate, lower promotional balances and a favorable funding mix as we continue to grow lower cost direct-to-consumer deposits. This was partially offset by the impact of a lower average prime rate in the quarter, an unfavorable funding rate reflecting maturities of lower coupon brokered and direct-to-consumer deposits and higher interest charge-offs.Total noninterest income was $520 million for the quarter, up $15 million or 3% year-over-year. The primary drivers of the increase were higher loan fees and an increase in transaction processing revenue. Net discounts and interchange revenue was up $281 million or 1%.Turning to Slide 10. Our net interest margin was 10.29% for the fourth quarter, consistent with our expectations. This was down 6 basis points year-over-year and 14 basis points sequentially. Relative to the prior year quarter, the decrease in NIM was due principally to three factors; first the unfavorable funding rate I just mentioned; second, the impact of a lower prime rate; and third, higher interest charge-offs. These were partially offset by a higher revolve rate, BT fees and a favorable promotional balance mix. Relative to the third quarter NIM decreased 14 basis points due to the impact of lower prime rate and an unfavorable funding rate, partially offset by a higher revolve rate and BT fees.Total loan yield decreased 7 basis points from a year ago to 12.52%, primarily driven by 12 basis point decrease in card yield reflecting prime rate decreases and higher interest charge-offs. This was partially offset by a higher revolve rate, BT fees and lower promotional balances.On the liability side of the balance sheet, average consumer deposits grew $3 billion in the quarter and now make up 55% of total funding. Consumer deposit rates decreased 13 basis points from the third quarter as we actively managed our funding costs lower. Although market observers expect a stable Fed funds rate this year, we'll remain vigilant for opportunities to prudently manage our deposit and other funding costs.Turning to Slide 11. Operating expenses increased $74 million or 7% from the prior year. Employee compensation was $33 million higher, reflecting staff increases in technology, as well as higher average salaries and benefit costs. Professional fees were $24 million higher, mainly driven by third party recovery fees. Cost to support investments in analytics also contributed to higher professional fees. The $20 million increase in information processing was driven by our continued investment in advanced analytics and infrastructure cost.Turning to credit on Slide 12. The takeaway here is that overall credit performance remains stable and well within our risk and return expectations. Total net charge offs increased 11 basis points from the prior year with the primary driver continuing to be the seasoning of loan growth and to a lesser extent, the supply driven normalization in consumer credit.Credit Card net charge offs increased 18 basis points from the prior year and 9 basis points from the prior quarter. The credit card 30-plus delinquency rate was 19 basis points higher year-over-year and 12 basis points sequentially. This was another solid credit performance in our card business, reflecting our disciplined underwriting and line management.We saw a modest uptick in student loan charge offs as portfolio seasoned. Student loan credit performance continues to be aided by efficiency gains in collections, including expanded outreach to co-signers. In personal loans, charge offs rose in the quarter consistent with typical seasonal pattern. The 30 plus delinquency rate was down 23 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points compared to the third quarter. We continue to see credit improve as a result of our prior credit tightening and improved fraud detection.Before leaving the subject of credit, I wanted to preview an additional disclosure and trouble debt restructuring you'll see in our 10-K. To provide greater clarity on the growth in our TDR receivables, we will now report that balance of receivables to have successfully completed programs. At December 31st, we had total credit card TDRs of $3.4 billion, up $1.1 billion from the prior year. But in fact, over half of the $1.1 billion increase was from customers who had successfully completed a program. In account number terms, this equates to above an 80% success rate. This demonstrates that our modification programs are an important aspect of helping customers through temporary hardship and also benefit Discover by reducing overall credit costs and enhancing revenue.Let's turn now to Slide 13. Our common equity tier one ratio decreased 20 basis points sequentially, reflecting loan growth and capital returns, partially offset by strong earnings. Our payout ratio, which includes buybacks, was 77% over the last 12 months. And as we noted earlier, average consumer deposits now make up 55% of total funding.Slide 14 provides a summary of 2019 business performance compared to our guidance for the year, and against 2018 performance. You'll see green check-marks against each of the metrics, and I want to congratulate the team for its solid execution against all of our key financial objectives for 2019.The following slide provides a summary of our outlook and guidance for 2020. First, we share the consensus view that the macroeconomic environment will remain stable. We do not see any indicators that point to a recession next in 12 months. We expect the U.S. consumer to remain healthy and unemployment remaining near the current levels. We also note that household debt service levels are at a 40 year low, an indication that consumers remained financially resilient. Based on these factors, we've assumed no Fed rate changes in our 2020 business plan. This backdrop sets us up for another year of profitable growth and strong returns.Now turning to the specific guidance elements. First, we expect loan growth to be in the range of 5% to 7%. Next, we expect operating expenses to be in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, as we continue to invest for future growth with incremental spending on our brand to increase awareness and considerations. We expect net charge-offs to be in the range of 3.3% to 3.5% percent this year, reflecting a stable credit environment and the seasoning of our growing portfolio.Our target CET1 ratio continues to be 10.5%, which remains an achievable target under CECL due to the phase-in for regulatory capital purposes and our capital generative business model. I'm sure you've noted our list of guidance for 2020 is a bit shorter. In fact, we've taken a fresh look and decided to no longer provide specific guidance on rewards rate for NIM.The rewards rate can vary quarter-to-quarter depending on the 5% category. The annual rate has been increasing by around 2 to 3 basis points due to the ongoing shift from the more card to the card, and we expect this trend to continue. In terms of NIM, the single largest driver of changes in net interest margin has been Fed actions. Given this, we've elected not to provide specific guidance but we'll comment on the other drivers, such as deposit beta and spending patterns as part of our quarterly earnings calls.So with that, I'll move onto the topic of CECL. On the last earnings call, I indicated that day-one adjustment would be towards the north end of the 55% to 65% range we'd guided to. We now expect our adjustment to be approximately $2.5 billion or 75% above the year end incurred basis.In terms of the day-two impact, the reserve change will depend upon the mix of the business, economic outlook, overall credit performance at the point in time in which quarterly estimates are determined. Additionally, the seasonality of our business will impact quarterly reserve changes and could introduce some volatility from one quarter to the next. As you've seen, our business model is capable of generating high returns, which should enable us to largely offset the capital implications of CECL overtime.Wrapping up on Slide 16. In 2019, we generated 6% total loan growth and delivered a robust 26% return on equity. We had a very strong year in our consumer deposits business with growth of 22%. Credit remained in line with our expectation and return targets, and we executed on our capital plan by allocating capital to loan growth and share buybacks. In conclusion, 2019 was a strong year and we're very pleased with our performance and positioning for 2020.That concludes our formal remarks. So I will turn the call back to her operator Erika to open up the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : So John, thanks for the updated day-one outlook on CECL where you said 75% increase. I guess first, what is driving that higher from the initial guidance? And then second on last quarter's call, you mentioned the day-two impact on the reserve builds to be higher than day-one since you\u2019re adding new accounts that don't have any incurred loss. The message is slightly different from what we've heard from others. So I just wanted to get sense, one, how should we think about -- does the fact that you're growing faster and adding more accounts factoring to that faster day-two impact, or is there something else that's impacting it? Thanks, and I have a follow up. John Greene : So let me start with day one impact. I think as I said one the last call, my take was team did a fantastic job in terms of modeling and preparing for CECL implementation, and that view still hold very, very strongly. The initial guidance, 55% to 65%, included a number of factors. And as we came through the fourth quarter, we took a look at the modeling, the performance of the portfolio and specifically recovery assumptions. And we ended up revising a recovery assumption that had to do with overall recoveries taking a look at most recent history, which was certainly stellar performance and we moved it back to the middle point of the observable history on recovery. So that was the primary driver of change in day-one.In terms of day-two, I said on my first call third quarter that day-two would be higher. And certainly in the third quarter was higher as we modeled, and that increase had to do with the amount of volume, we put on the books related to our student loan products, which in terms of day-two impact has a significantly higher impact than day-one would under incurred basis.Now, that actually points to some of the volatility that we're seeing in CECL. So as we take a look at all our product and the relative mix throughout the year, I would say a good proxy for day-two would be that range around 75%. So it's slight nuance on the initial message that I provided. But I would also caution that that's a preliminary number and we're working through it. And there's a bunch of dynamics that impact CECL, including the macroeconomic outlook, portfolio performance, mix of products that we're putting on the book in any one quarter and obviously, the delinquency and the rates that we're observing, so a lot to consider there. But I hope I've provided enough specificity to be helpful as you think about how to model this business. Ryan Nash : And then I guess a follow up for the both of you. So if I look at the expense guide and that was about 7.5% to 12% expense growth, which is ahead of I guess expectations and where you are running. So first, John, can you be size what are some of the incremental investments? And Roger, are there any one off investments in here that you feel you need to make for this year? Or are we entering into a new phase of elevated investing? And then second, how should we think about seeing the paybacks from these investments? John Greene : Ryan, I'll start and then Roger I'm sure will have a follow up. So I'm going to start with by editorializing a little bit here. So if you look at the efficiency ratio that this company has generated overtime, it's among the lowest in the industry. And then if you also look at the returns in terms of return on equity, we are among the highest in the industry. And one could use those two data points to make a simple argument that perhaps we've under invested over time, given how much -- given the returns that we're generating.So as we put the plan together for 2020, we looked at where it was appropriate to invest, where we thought we'd generate the best long term returns for our shareholders. And there was there was two items specifically. So investments in brand around awareness and consideration and that's a meaningful number to be around $100 million, believe or not. And then also continued investment in our infrastructure to add functionality and ensure it's appropriate from a scale and resiliency standpoint going forward. Roger Hochschild : And maybe just to build on what John said in terms of the payback. Some will be more immediate, so drive our car continued strong loan growth but others, we expect multiyear returns. And as you think more broadly about our expenses, I'd say it's sort of a dual story of efficiency but then also investments. And so the vast majority of the expense lines are close to flat year-over-year, as John and I look across the P&L. We're looking for our efficiencies in terms of our marketing expenses, so our CPAs that we're targeting across the different products. But we are investing significantly around building the brand and also building brand awareness of some of our non-card products, as well as some investments in technology that we think will be very helpful in driving growth in the future. John Greene : And then just one follow up comment. So this company has a rich tradition of effectively managing costs and certainly my background, I've had my share of cost management and analytics to ensure we are going to get a payback on these investments. So as Rodger said, some of these are longer-term, some of these are shorter-term. We will continue to monitor and ensure that for every dollar we're spending, we're getting appropriate paybacks for our shareholders. Operator : We will take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : I guess I wanted to dig in again on day-two impact related to CECL. So I was wondering, John, if you could give us a little bit more to help us sort of triangulate on how we should think about the provision for 2020? John Greene : So I've guided around that 75% figure as a sort of poster and anchor as you think about day-two. It's early, as I mentioned in my last comment, Sunjay. So I would say for the year, that's a decent way to think about it, it might be a little higher, might be a little lower. And in terms of quarter-over-quarter, you know the third quarter we originate a lot of student loans and that day-two will certainly exceed the 75% number that I just mentioned. So mix will be an important factor of it. But beyond that, you know I don't know if I'd be doing any one of service by being more specific. Sanjay Sakhrani : And then on the other guidance data point around loan growth and not getting a whole lot on NIM and rewards rate. I was wondering if we think about loan growth and what revenue growth might do in relation to loan growth. Is it fair to assume that it should be fairly commensurate, i.e. there's not significant factor that would lead to a different direction than what loan growth would suggest, or am I thinking about it incorrectly? John Greene : No, I think you're definitely in the right direction. So there's a couple of things that I just want to point out. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we assume no Fed rate changes in our planning assumptions. So if that changes, that certainly as it has historically and been a problem from a forecasting standpoint, that would impact NIM. We're also -- I alluded to this in the prepared remarks, in terms of our focus around deposits and increasing the level of overall funding from direct-to-consumer deposits, which are cheaper funding service.I also mentioned that I think there is some over time we will continue to work to see what we can do in terms of the cost of deposits, making sure that we're originated the deposits at an appropriate level that fund the balance sheet towards our longer-term target, but also being very mindful of the cost of funding. So if things went well, there could be a basis point or two on the deposit side. That's your call whether you want to put that into your model. And then in terms of pricing action, the company has been pretty stable, but we will continue to look for opportunities on the pricing side. Operator : We will take our next question from John Pancari from Evercore. John Pancari : I just have a question on the TDRs, and know you will be giving us more disclosure in the K. But I wondered if you could give us of the $85 million loan loss reserves build that you recorded for the quarter. How much of that was related to TDRs? And then separately, do you have what the delinquency ratio was for the TDRs for the quarter? John Greene : So for the quarter, we previously said this and it remains consistent that from a TDR standpoint only 5% are more than 90 days delinquent so that's remain consistent, so performance there, no major change. In terms of reserve provisioning, we\u2019re probably not going to break that down on this call. I don't know that it would be super helpful and if I did, it would take the balance of the call, that's kind of walk through the nuances of it. So we will pass on that one if you don\u2019t mind. Sorry, I can't be more specific, John. John Pancari : No, I get it, that\u2019s fine. I guess one more on the TDR topic. Just given the increase that you cited, up $1.1 billion year-over-year that's about just under 50% increase and then TDRs were up 9% linked quarter it looks like. What are you seeing differently in your -- the makeup of your card base that you, that Discover is seeing a much larger increase in the usage of TDRs versus a lot of your peer institutions. I know you can't really talk too much about what the peers are seeing. But the increase in TDRs has certainly outpaced that of other lenders in the space. John Greene : So let me start off by saying that we have some really solid analytics around our TDRs. And we test populations and once those tests come back and show that indeed cash flows are improving, we'll open it up to certain population. And then we will observe that and then we will adjust accordingly based on any differences we see between test populations and when the TDR specific program is in process. So I'm not really going to talk about what other folks are doing.There also is an approach that we take where we think that, and we've seen real differences in terms of outcomes for our customer base, in terms of helping them work through some difficulty and they end up, some 80% of them end up sticking with us, have their credit lines open backup and continue to be very, very satisfied customers.So what around the edges, we're going to take a look at smaller account and see if the effort to make a TDR is worthwhile based on our beliefs in terms of what's going to happen in those particular populations. But these are good programs. The financial impact is taken as soon as we TDR, they remain in the delinquency buckets that they are in unless they have made three successful payments.So what you're seeing flow through the financials is exactly what you would hope in terms of overall good credit performance and a solid book and TDRs is an approach to work with customers and help cash flow. Roger Hochschild : And maybe just to build on that. There has been a lot of noise around this, and so that's part of why we decided to add the disclosures to help provide you more information and kind of give us more insight into the way we see it. You know a better way to classify it might be, not just TDRs but customers who have ever been in a TDR. And so the growth, really some of them, will have returned to prime will be getting line increases et cetera and are well into the book. It just happens to be the way we account for these is once a TDR always a TDR. So that's why we think these new disclosures that you see in the K will be very helpful. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : My question is what are the implications of the 10.5% CET1 target for the end of 2020, which I believe is kind of what you guys have indicated, you think you should operate longer term on the payout ratio as we look beyond 2020 and sort of to factor in the continued phase in of the CECL impacts along with continued loan growth? John Greene : So I'll take this and maybe Roger will have a comment if that's appropriate. So when the team set up the original target for CET1, they did that with the idea that indeed CECL would be implemented and would impact the overall capital plan for the year 2019 through the first half of 2020. So we are going through our beginning our CCAR work and we're going to make the submission, and we'll get some feedback likely in June. And we'll use that coupled with our overall plan around capital allocation that we'll review with the board to make a determination of what the future dividend payout ratio and buyback programs will look like. I would say this.So as we look at CECL for 2020 and our capital generative business models, we can likely absorb over the short term based in the phase in and long term the impact CECL. Now there's questions regarding our regulators and how CECL will impact the consumer finance industry especially given its pro-cyclical nature and the fact that products with longer lives, such as student loans and certain home equity products and even to a lesser extent personal loans. In a tough economic environment, certain lenders might not look like the profile of that that will impact the availability of credit. I will say this, we like our products under Cecil and under the current FAS5 methodology. So it's based on the cash flow, CECL is not impacting the cash flows. And we like the return profiles that we've generated historically and will in the future. Roger Hochschild : And to build on that from our discussions with regulators, I wouldn't interpret the phase-in as just delaying the pain. The Fed has indicated to us that it's designed to give them time to see how CECL is impacting different financial institutions, and that actually they feel like the amounts of loss of absorption in the system currently, i. e. pre-CECL, which is capital plus provision, is appropriate. So we'll see how that comes out. But again, I wouldn't just necessarily view it as something that's going to phase-in and that's that. Mark DeVries : So Roger, does that imply that there is some room for the Fed to potentially say now that you've got greater loss absorption capacity kind of post-CECL that maybe the 10.5% isn't the right level that maybe you could go a bit lower? Roger Hochschild : I would not predict what the Fed is going to do. I can just say what I've heard directly from them, which is they feel like pre-CECL the lost absorption is right for the system as a whole and that the phase-in is not just spread it out overtime, that actually gives them time to figure out what they want to do. So I'd say, all we have to stay tuned. John Greene : And the other kind of party that will help form this will be the rating agencies. And you know we spend some time with the rating agencies in December, and the view there is at least my take, my personal takeaway is that they're going take a look at equity and reserves as in the aggregate. So I don't see any major implications at least in the short-term there. Operator : We will take our next question from Eric Wasserstorm from UBS. Eric Wasserstorm : I have a question just about credit. You know I heard your commentary about broad-based stability, but also we're seeing a few other trends too, such as you know higher interest charge-offs and investment in collections, higher late fees. There is a TDR experience that you cited, the interest rate seems high but there is plenty to add just to growth in TDRs is also very large. So I'm just trying to put all of those pieces together to understand kind of how to really think about the credit experience over the near-term horizon. John Greene : Yes, I wouldn't worry about straining a bunch of things together. I think we've talked about the TDRs and are adding more disclosures so that hopefully that will help you see them the way we do. In terms of investing in collections, I think that's something that makes a ton of sense just about any time but certainly late cycle. But that's something we've talked about, I think pretty consistently for multiple years there. So if you are trying to spring those data points into a bigger story, I'm not sure that's something I would agree with. Eric Wasserstorm : And maybe just transitioning topics for a moment in terms of the investment expense that you've highlighted. Is this an expense that you are thinking about over a specific horizon, or should we just think about the overall efficiency ratio of Discover as just being a little bit different going forward than maybe what the recent historical experience has been? John Greene : I think we've provided guidance for what to expect for 2020. My guess is going beyond that, we'll continue to invest in growth. But I'm also optimistic about our ability to find efficiencies as well, especially leveraging some of those investments on the technology side around robotic process automation, around advanced analytics. So we're not prepared to really give guidance beyond 2020. But you can rest assured we'll be looking to see what we can find on the efficiencies side to help fund investment in growth. Operator : We will take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Sort of following and I appreciate Roger that you're not interested in giving guidance beyond that. But if you put together the comments that you do expect to pay back from those investments and obviously the efficiency ratio, given you're likely to see revenue growth in between 5% and 6% at most there is going to deteriorate in 2020. I mean should we take from that the inference that at some point it should be improving, or can you discuss that a little bit? Roger Hochschild : Actually, it sound like you're asking for long-term guidance. No, again, as I said earlier, we're not giving guidance beyond next year. But I did want to make it clear that you shouldn't necessarily take that as a run rate number. And we do believe, to the point John made, as efficient as our model is compared to the rest of the financial services industry, we believe there's further efficiencies to be gained by deploying some of these advances in technology. So we're not also saying that you can just continue to print the number for 2020. Moshe Orenbuch : And maybe just to take that idea, because I\u2019m not a huge fan of the ideas that well, because it's lower than others, we should want it necessarily to be higher for some period of timing. You talked about the high level of returns, but it's not like we're seeing degradation in that, it's not like that it was running down. So maybe talk a little bit about what are the things you saw that you know made this the right time to take that stand on expenses? Roger Hochschild : I think it\u2019s a very good point, Moshe. We don't manage the business to an efficiency ratio. We manage our expenses to be as efficient as possible. But then also look to invest and drive growth, but some of those too really is the entire expense base and drive the calculation of efficiency ratio. But to the extent we see opportunities to make investments to drive accelerated growth and we feel good about the payback, as John talked about, we will do that and communicate that as appropriate. But I think your points are good one, you don\u2019t honestly just manage the business to an efficiency ratio. Moshe Orenbuch : No, I don\u2019t think so and I guess I look forward to having a future discussion about seeing some of those gains coming in on the revenue side. Operator : We will take our next question from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : This is Mihir for Jason. I just had a -- maybe we could start with just CECL, just want to make sure we understand you. And given I think you mentioned CECL has a differential impact on some of your products, particularly on day-two and then as we go into the quarters. Does that change the way you think about those products and also just relatedly in terms of just the disclosures you will be providing. Are you going to provide disclosure for the next several quarters so we can compare results on a more apples-to-apples basis? John Greene : So in terms of how we think about our products, we think about them from a cash flow standpoint and risk and return -- on a risk and return basis. And we continue to like all our products, whether we are on an incurred basis or under this new regime CECL, so no change in the thinking there. Now in terms of disclosure, what we've said previously, we continue to be in the same spot that we will provide disclosures that will create transparency between CECL incurred for the next four quarters. Unidentified Analyst : And then just real quick, if I can go back to just the OpEx. I guess, clearly it's the topic on this call, but maybe we could get -- if you could give us a little bit of more color on just kinds of investments you're making and just maybe, just help us understand. Your loan growth next year is 5.5 to 7 is a little, I guess, in the range similar to this year, and it sounds like that some of these investments have a little bit longer payback period, but if it also supporting that 5 to 7 loan growth this year. And do you need to make those investments to achieve that growth, I guess on that\u2026 John Greene : So here's how we think about it. So there is the investment in brands to drive awareness and considerations. We haven't actually baked it in but we think that over time will lower our acquisition cost, our per unit acquisition cost as people find greater awareness of Discover, the product offerings, the customer experience and frankly, a fair value exchange, so that is one aspect but that is overtime and to be determined.The other piece around technology investments, we're going to be very judicious about those and with those to make sure that we are deploying functionality that help make a difference to either our growth trajectory or expense profile. So overtime, I would expect that indeed we'll see efficiency gains, either top line or through the expense base. And some of them, as Roger said, longer term some are shorter term, but there's a thorough process to make sure we're getting the banks the buck. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : When we think about the sort of normal factors that cause hardship, loss of job, death, unemployment or illness and divorce. Is there anything that idiosyncratic that you're seeing that's changing in the portfolio, or is there a policy shift that's driving this? John Greene : No, there's no change in terms of, I'll say customer behaviour. What you're seeing here is frankly, the benefit of frankly some from solid analytics by our collections team in terms of when a customer is experiencing difficulty and helping that customer managed through it. The only process change we've made is it used to be someone has to call in and talk to a rep. For large balances, that continues to be the case. For certain customers who meet certain criterias, they can do it online on their mobile app. And we've tested those populations versus the call in populations and actually the mobile app populations are performing as well or better than when someone talks to a rep.So what you're really seeing here in the growth is a couple of factors; one is that I think there's a difference in reporting versus some competitors; two is, we have done an analytical exercise to make sure we understand paybacks and where to make a difference to cash flows positively and we've will opened those up. So it's a combination of those factors. And we're going to keep doing it as long as they're cash flow positive. Rick Shane : And to the extent if you construct it from an NPV perspective, does the transition to CECL and for lifetime reserve make it easier, because there is less accounting sort of penalty to doing this? John Greene : In terms of the P&L impact right when you take a TDR, you basically take the net present value of the cash flows and compare it to your balance, and that's the P&L impact. CECL, you basically do the same thing on life of loan losses. So yes, the relative kind of detriment to the P&L if you are growing TDRs is smaller under CECL. But you know that's not how we make decisions here. Operator : We will take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : John, couple of follow ups on the day-two or conceptual accounting, can you clarify what you mean by the 75% not on day-one but on day-two. Are you talking about incremental division on just the loan growth? And then also can you talk once your allowance rate sort of is set, will it remain relatively stable through the year if there's no change in sort of mix or economic outlook? John Greene : So in terms of 75% on day-two, it would be relative to what they would on incurred basis. So an incremental 75% versus incurred. Now loan growth will create incrementality versus an incurred basis, just the nature of taking a lifetime loss upfront in a provisioning standpoint.And the team did a really good job in terms of modeling. And you know we feel like we're appropriately reserved. And from a day-one standpoint and going forward, if we're seeing better recoveries through a cycle or are better performance from a overall portfolio standpoint, then we'll adjust. And correspondingly, if we're challenged somewhere we will adjust the other way. Don Fandetti : But conceptually, what do you think about sort of the reasons all else equal that the allowance rate remain relatively stable throughout year despite mix or economic change and we talking about sort of CECL being an incremental couple percent GAAP EPS impact, all else equal? John Greene : So I'm not sure I\u2019m totally clear on the question. But I will try to answer and if I miss, we can come back. So in terms of -- if we're seeing a change in the economy or outlook of the economy, or a change in the performance of our portfolio, or a change in mix, all those will have an impact on the CECL reserves. Don Fandetti : No I get that, but I\u2019m saying if those were not to change with the allowance rate, all else equal, kind of stay the same throughout the year. John Greene : So it would build for loan growth at that rate. But in terms of relative difference to incurred, it'd be fairly consistent. Operator : We will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : So Roger, just wanted to swing back to the investment spend. I think during some of the comments, you were mentioning that with the investment spend, you are expecting to be able to enhance the brand awareness, if you use of words in particular or especially in non-card product. I'm wondering if your messaging does that you think that you're under-representing either the personal loans or in the student loans, or if there is products that you're looking to get into? Maybe you could touch base on what implications for that is. And if the payback for the investment should come in the form more in loan growth and NII, or should there be any fees associated with it as well? I just like to understand how to think about that. Roger Hochschild : So the investment in brand there two parts, right. Part of it is just increasing considering on the card side. You've some more ground building awareness that we offer products other than just cash back, so we put add money behind miles as well. But we do, as we look at consumers out there, there is a gap in terms of both top of tunnel, people who consider Discover and have us top of mind. So that\u2019s why as we think about our marketing mix, we're going to heavy up a bit on top of funnel brand type advertising.There also is an opportunity for our non-core products, in particular some of the deposit products. We've made great strides in terms of the product themselves, went out with no fees across any of our deposit products. But there still are huge amounts of consumers that don't understand, for example, we've even in the student loan business, let alone we are the second largest originator of private students loans and the same holds true with understand that Discover offers the savings account and checking account. So it\u2019s a mix of both of those. Building and enhancing consideration on the card side and building awareness for our non-card products. Betsy Graseck : And then this investment spend should kick off in 1Q, like if I take this $100 million and just divide by four and throw that through the model linearly, or is this going to be back end loaded in a 4Q environment. How should I think about the pace of that spend throughout the year? Roger Hochschild : We tend not to comment on the seasonality of the spend. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Roger and John, I had a high level of question on the guidance for you. I think everyone would agree with your earlier point that you guys have a rich history of generating high returns and industry leading operating efficiency. But within that, there's also been a commitment to positive operating leverage that we're not seeing in this year's guidance with your revenue growth and expense guidance suggesting that you're explicitly guiding to negative operating leverage. And so when we think about what's changed, it seems like in the past what we've seen from Discover is a commitment to managing expenses for the revenue environment and achieving positive operating leverage by finding cost improvement opportunities in one area, to the extent that you need to make investments in another, as opposed to the approach that you guys seem to be taking now, which is more along the lines of making the investments upfront with the expectation that you'll get the efficiency improvements later. So is that an accurate way of thinking about? I was just hoping you could comment on that and to share any high level thoughts, and that's my only question. Thanks. Roger Hochschild : So first I'd say it's -- John is new, but you've got the same team that's been here for decades, making the investment. And I think you've seen a lot of discipline from us over the years, whether it's on the credit side or the expense side. It isn't necessarily a trade off where we sort of manage to an expense budget and then sort of if we can generate more efficiencies and that frees up more money for growth, we try and be disciplined and consistent.So our investments in growth are really more driven by the opportunities we see to put our shareholders' money to work to drive good organic growth, with strong return profiles for that. And I mentioned that we expect our unit costs on the investments and the acquisition to be coming down next year. But we do feel like there's an opportunity to put some money to work with a bit of a longer payback on the brand side, in particular sort of top of funnel brand advertising dropping that awareness and consideration and on technology, that reflect some specific decisions we're making for 2020, I would not read into it any change in discipline, or philosophy from the team here at Discover. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Bob Napoli : I guess kind of follow up on, just on the revenue growth, the loan growth and revenue growth. Is there the potential through some of the deposit products, are they consumer banking products, the growth of AREVA pay B2B that you could get revenue growth higher than loan growth over time. Is that a goal and is there a potential to do that? And it seems you've made a lot of investments in the network and in B2B payments over the last several years? Roger Hochschild : Yes, B2B payments have benefited probably so far more in terms of volume than profitability. The margins can be very thin, but we've been clear that we would love to see more of our earnings come from the payments segments, and are very focused on driving that. That can be a multiyear initiative. So I wouldn't necessarily expect something transformational in 2020, but we have a unique collection of payments assets. If you look at PULSE, Diners Club and sort of the fact that we built the third largest global network in terms of acceptance, so the team is very focused on monetizing that. But again, you're talking about a B2B sales cycle and so that will take some time. Bob Napoli : Maybe a follow-up on the competitive environment, and with the entrance of the Apple Card, which mean maybe is going, there have to be your demographic, the growth of [neobanks] probably going after the deposit space. In your target segments, several of them -- some of those companies getting super high valuations as private companies. What are your thoughts on the Apple Card, on the [neobanks], and some of your investment in brand in response to the competitive environment? Roger Hochschild : So our investments in brand are much more driven by our traditional competitors. And as we're seen those super-high private company valuations appear to come and go. As I think about competition, competition in the card space is always intense. It tends to be rational but you have some large sophisticated players, it's a high-return business. It's challenging but always intensively competitive. So I would view that Apple Card as you can't underestimate anything that Apple does. It's is a new competitor and one I told before formidable, but I don't think it's transforming the overall competitive environment in the cards space.On the deposit side, it's a different decision in terms of who you take a loan from, from who you give your money. And so brand and trust remain key elements of that. I think as you saw from the very strong direct-to-consumer deposit growth we posted, we feel like we have the product set and ability to compete, we really just need to build awareness. And a lot of the focus is on moving deposits from some of the traditional branch based players as opposed to us really going head-to-head with some of these emerging online players. Operator : We will take our next question from John Hecht from Jefferies. John Hecht : Actually most my questions have been asked but a couple of follow ups there. Number one is that you mentioned some unfavorable funding triggers in the quarter and I'm wondering are you able to unwind or are those kind of permanent aspects of the funding going forward? John Greene : So actually what that was is if you go back about a year-and-a-half ago, we had some really cheap CDs on the books, and then there was Fed rate actions and more expensive deposits came on the books. And over time if there is no Fed action, you will see favorability come through into the P&L on that. And if you look at... John Hecht : And what duration should we expect that and where you'll get that favorable outcome on the deposit costs? John Greene : So, it's throughout this year and into next year. John Hecht : And then follow up question would be, you've taken deposit as a percentage of funding up a couple of hundred basis points in 2019 period. How should we think about funding mix over the course of 2020? John Hecht : So we enjoyed great growth there, I think it's testament to both the team and the products and Discover, in general. We have a longer-term target of 70% direct to consumer deposits thereabouts, and I would say next three to five years on that. So one way to do it would be to draw a line and plot it accordingly. Operator : We will take our next question from David Scharf with JMP. David Scharf : Once again pretty much all my questions have been answered except that I do want to just follow up when I hope is not a repetitive topic. On the investment spend, it seemed like collections was highlighted a couple of times, and I think backward looking in the fourth quarter, I have written down that you had more third-party professional fees. And then going forward, it was more of a broader investment late cycle. Just curious, I mean should we be thinking about sort of under capacity with in-house collectors. Is that why you defaulted to more third parties, or are you finding any challenges with recovery rates internally? Can you give us a little color besides just the cyclical factors? Roger Hochschild : Ss just to be clear, in terms of collections which we define as prior charge off, 100% of that in house. And so that\u2019s with our own US-based employee, it is very scalable. A lot of our investments have been in the area of analytics, as well as if you think about collections is marketing. We have seen great impact from building out digital collections. There are a lot of people who may not want to talk about the situation therein, but like seeing an office they have online.And so I think collections is an area where you can achieve competitive advantage. So it's been something that -- there hasn't been a change in our investment strategy there, it's been a multiyear journey and we expect to continue. On the recovery side, we do work with third parties. And so to the extent recoveries are more successful, because of the commission structures we will pay more in recovery fees but that usually means there is a net benefit. John Greene : And just adding onto that. So the recoveries are up year-over-year about 28%. So what you're seeing is that that's I think a factor of portfolio but probably more reflective of where we are in the economic cycle and the fact that the consumer strength is probably quite frankly increasing and as wealth distribution is also improving mildly. So not a bad story there on the professional fees whatsoever. Roger Hochschild : And just one thing I will point out, on the recovery side, we do not sell any of our charge-off paper, and haven't for well over 10 years. So you know you do enjoy a stream from those recoveries as opposed to people who would just sell and take the NPV. David Scharf : And as far as -- just a quick follow-up, I assume embedded in your net charge-off range you provided for 2020 is a consistent recovery rate as a percentage of gross charge off rate is there any modification or conservatism built out? John Greene : So overall charge-offs, I mean we gave the range that's a net , and I think we're pretty comfortable with that as guidance. Operator : We'll take our next question from Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank. Meng Jiao : I just have one quick question, I guess on the deposits. It looks like I guess the brokered deposits were pretty down here. Is that the -- I guess the runway going forward is that we should see more, I guess, run off in the broker deposits range, as well as continued expansion in the direct to consumer? Roger Hochschild : In general, that's the plan. We're going to keep that open as the channel. But in terms of our funding stack, that should continue to decrease as an overall percentage of the funding stack as the DTC increases. Meng Jiao : And then I guess the second question is in terms of M&A, I know you guys are focused on B2B partnerships and noting that less interest in a bank deal. Has that changed materially from -- in prior quarters, or is that still the same message going forward? Roger Hochschild : I think we feel good about the businesses we're in and our ability to grow that organically. And I think if you look on the banking side, I don't see any gaps in our model that we would need to fill. Operator : We'll take our next question is from Bill Ryan with Compass Point. Bill Ryan : Question on student lending, if you could maybe give us some idea of what your origination volume was in 2019 versus 2018 dollars and/or percent and maybe what your outlook is for 2020? And maybe a little bit of color what you're seeing in terms of pricing your market share and borrower profile. John Greene : So in terms of growth, we said organically we had 9% organic growth in student loans, not on originations but loan balance and we provided overall guidance on loan growth, which is inclusive of student loans. So we're not going to get into kind of origination levels, we just don't think that's probably the most helpful information. Bill Ryan : And any color on pricing or where do you think your market share is and things like that? Roger Hochschild : I think we feel good about the season of originations we've had. So again, they're a little harder to get market share data, but we certainly thought we held our position as the second largest originator, even in an environment where there were some new entrants. And in terms of kind of who we target and credit, we remain very disciplined. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : When you talk about the investment spend, how much of the investment spend, or are other plans to use this period of time to significantly invest in the global network in particular? And how much is the focus there given what you've talked about on investment spend? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Yes, I think we highlighted the two areas where we want to call out a significant increase. One was around the brand and advertising, the one the other one was on technology. We did not highlight a significant change in spending. And again, as we look at building our global acceptance, some of it is working with acquirers, some of those are very cost-effective. We built through the network-to-network agreements and that will remain a core part of the strategy. Operator : And there are no further questions. At this time, Mr. Streem, your closing remarks please. Craig Streem : Thanks, Erika. Thank you everybody for your attention and for staying with us through this long call. But we wanted to make sure that we took care of everybody's questions and didn't cut anybody off. But if you have any follow-ups, please come back to me and we will take care of it. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You many now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2020 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Craig Streem : Sure. Thanks a lot, Maria. Good morning, everybody and welcome to our call. We will begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find as always in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com.Our discussion this morning contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear on today\u2019s earnings press release and presentation. Our call this morning will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild and from John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. And after we conclude our formal comments, there will be time as Maria said for question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, we would appreciate that if you limit yourself initially to one question, if you have a follow-up maybe queue back in, so we can be sure to accommodate as many participants as possible.And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, Craig and thanks to our listeners for joining today\u2019s call. I hope all of you and your families are staying healthy and safe during these very challenging times. I would also like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank the healthcare workers, first responders, grocery store workers and many others, who have working so hard and often great personal sacrifice for the benefit of our communities and country. We will be a bit different than our traditional earnings calls. After my opening remarks, John will discuss our first quarter results with a particular focus on the reserve builds. I will then come back and provide additional information as to what we have been seeing since the end of the first quarter.Here at Discover, our top priority has been the health and safety of our employees. Our headquarters functions moved to work from home on March 16 with minimal disruption. And our technology team and field leadership did an incredible job getting nearly all of our 8,000 Discover call center team members working from the safety of their homes within two weeks. Our robust business continuity plans, digital business model and a 100% U.S. based customer service helped ensure our representatives were ready even as we faced an unprecedented increase in call volumes from concerned customers impacted by the coronavirus. Early on in the crisis, we answered 95% of calls in less than 5 minutes and for April, as our team got more comfortable working from home, average full-times have been under 1 minute.We are providing significant support to our customers across every product that helped them through this crisis. We have expanded payment plans across our credit card, student and personal loan and home equity products and waived fees on CD early withdrawals for customers who need emergency access to their funds. Our strong capital position and balanced funding model are also a source of strength. John will provide additional detail, but I am especially pleased with the strong demand we are seeing for our deposit products.Some of the early impacts of the pandemic can be seen in our first quarter results, specifically in sales volume and card loan growth. For the company overall, we generated a net loss of $61 million or $0.25 per share as the benefits of solid growth in average loans were more than offset by higher provision expense. As we adopted the CECL reserve methodology on January 1, the reserve build this quarter reflected the life of loan view as well as an outlook for a weaker economy and higher unemployment. Actions we have taken since the crisis began, includes significant tightening of underwriting for new card and personal loan accounts with additional employment verification. And we have pulled back on balance transfer offers and line increases.As I have mentioned on prior calls, for the last 18 months, we have been tightening credit at the margin as we have felt for some time that we are on late credit cycle. But given the present environment, we are adopting a significantly more cautious view. To give you a sense for how our card portfolio compares today with how it looked at the end of 2007, our contingent liability meaning the total open-to-buy for our card products has been reduced from roughly 5.7x loans to around 2.7x and the percentage of the portfolio below a FICO score of 660 has gone from 26% at that time down to 19% at the end of 2019. So while we are not immune from the impacts of deterioration in the economy, our portfolio significantly better positioned than it was ahead of the last financial crisis. In addition to our credit actions, we are taking a hard look at operating expenses to ensure investments align with the economic environment. We are implementing approximately $400 million of cost reductions over the remaining three quarters of 2020 and we will continue to review expense levels as the economic environment evolves.I will now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail, then I will come back to discuss the current environment. John Greene : Thank you, Roger and good morning everyone. Before I begin, I want to echo Roger\u2019s thanks to all the people working on the frontline through the pandemic. I also want to thank all of Discover associates. They have pivoted to a work from home environment, while maintaining their high service levels and professionalism throughout. Today, I will summarize the results for the quarter then provide details on our credit performance and loan provisions. I will conclude with an update on capital and funding trends before turning the call back over to Roger to summarize our COVID-19 response actions.In light of the uncertainty in the economy, we are withdrawing our previously provided guidance. But as Roger mentioned, we are targeting $400 million of cost reductions through the balance of the year with the majority in the second half. Our expense actions include reducing account acquisition expense, cutting spending on brand awareness and consideration activities, and reducing vendor and technology spend. We will continue to review all discretionary spending as the payback on incremental spend has changed.In the interest of focusing our comments this morning on the impacts of the pandemic and our responses, we are not going to review our customary slides on loan growth, payment volumes and revenue, so you can find additional disclosures on Slide 11 to 16 in the appendix to this presentation. And as always, we are happy to take questions on these or any other aspects of the quarterly results.On Slide 4, looking at key elements of the income statement, revenue, net of interest expense, increased 5% this quarter driven primarily by a 6% increase in average loans and a $35 million net gain in our payment services segment principally from the sale of a portion of an equity investment. Net interest margin was 10.21% for the first quarter. This was down 25 basis points year-over-year due largely to lower loan yields as a prime rate came down in response to Fed rate cuts in September and October of last year. This was partially offset by lower funding costs. The additional Fed rate cuts in March of this year will impact net interest margin beginning in the second quarter.Provisions for credit losses included net charge-off of $769 million, up 8% from last year and an increase in reserves of approximately $1 billion, reflecting a deterioration in the economic outlook. I will have some additional comments in credit in a moment, but before we turn to the next slide, I want to discuss operating expenses. They were up 13% from their prior year first quarter. The increase was principally due to higher compensation expense, increased marketing cost and investments in technology.Turning now to Slide 5 showing our key credit metrics, credit performance remained stable in the first quarter. We did not see any discernible impacts from the national COVID-19 containment activities or from our own credit mitigation actions in response. Card charge-offs increased 15 basis points from last year\u2019s quarter due principally to seasoning of loan growth. The credit card 30-plus delinquency rate was up 17 basis points from last year, but flat versus the prior quarter with both metrics reflecting consistent performance in typical seasonal patterns. Our private student loan and personal loan portfolios also had credit performance in the quarter with both showing slight improvements in charge-off and delinquency rates.On Slide 6, you will see our allowance for credit losses. We added $2.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses in January of this year as we transition to a life of loan CECL basis. At the end of the quarter, we added approximately $1 billion to the allowance largely due to changes in the macroeconomic forecast. The reserve build assumes unemployment rising to more than 9%, recovering through 2022 and a decline in GDP of nearly 18%. We also included our best estimate of reserve implications of the government stimulus programs. As the economic outlook evolves and the impacts of the various government relief programs become more clear, we will adjust our allowance accordingly.Turning to Slide 7, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 10 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a decrease in loan balances partially offset by capital returns. For purpose of calculating regulatory capital, we have elected to defer recognition of the CECL Day 1 adjustment for 2 years. So we will begin to phase in our Day 1 CECL impact in 2022 with 100% saved in by 2025. The federal banking regulators have also provided a phase in for the Day 2 impacts of CECL with 25% of the quarterly reserve build also being deferred until 2022 and then create the same as the Day 1 deferral. Our payout ratio, which includes buybacks, was 99% over the last 12 months.As Roger noted, we have suspended our share buyback program, but we will continue to fund our regular quarterly dividends. Our liquidity position remains very strong. As of the end of the quarter, we had $19 billion in liquid assets, $6 billion in committed borrowing capacity through privately placed asset-backed securitizations, and $35 billion in borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve discount window. As of April 20, our liquid assets have grown to more than $23 billion. In addition to those forms of actual and committed liquidity, we have access to funding through our direct-to-consumer deposit channel with average deposits increasing 20% year-over-year and now making up over 55% of total funding. Based on the strength of consumer demand yesterday, we reduced rates on our savings account by 10 basis points and will continue to look for opportunities to do so.In summary, good progress on the expense front. Liquidity is robust. Capital remains strong and we continue to monitor and manage our credit exposure. And now I will turn the call back over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, John. While we will not be providing new guidance given the uncertain economic outlook, I do want to provide you with an update on two key areas, where the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting our business in a way that was not captured in the Q1 results.On Slide 8, we are giving you a detailed look at sales volume trends to illustrate how COVID-19 has affected cardholder spending in April as compared to the much smaller impact we saw on the first quarter sales. The first column shows the composition of sales by category for the full year 2019. So you can see where our cardholders spend is normally distributed by industry. We then give you the year-over-year growth percentages for the first quarter of 2020 and month-to-date April. On a day-adjusted basis everyday sales which includes gas, groceries, and wholesale clubs and makes up about 22% of total sales, so growth of 10% during the quarter.So far in April however, everyday sales are down 14% year-over-year as increased spending on groceries is more than offset by a 60% reduction in spend in petroleum. Discretionary spend is down 33% driven by the travel category, which although only 8% of cardholder spending is down 99% and by retail, which is down 11%. As long as stay at home orders remain in place and many businesses remained closed, we expect the weak sales volume trend to continue and future trends will depend upon the pace of the recovery.Turning to Slide 9, I want to take you through the Skip-a-Payment programs we have implemented to help our customers during this period of economic difficulty. We have recognized that COVID-19 has placed financial stress on the Discover customers who maybe out of work or has suffered reduced wages. One of the key differences in this downturn compared to the great recession of 2008, 2010, has been the staggering pace of job loss, but also the amount of government stimulus and the potential for many of those jobs to be restored after a hopefully brief period of unemployment. Therefore, we are offering support to those impacted by COVID-19 with Skip-a-Payment programs available across all of our products, many modeled on the relief we traditionally provide for natural disaster.Through the first half of April, we have enrolled over 450,000 customers and roughly $3.8 billion in receivables in Skip-a-Payment programs to provide financial relief to our customers across our lending products. The receivables enrolled now represent 4% of total loans, but we are encouraged that the number of daily enrollments has been declining since the level peaked in late March. We will continue to work with these customers closely and potentially extend programs when required to meet the customers\u2019 needs.Let me close by summarizing some of the actions we have taken to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have shifted virtually all of our employees to work from home in a sustainable model that still continues to provide an industry leading customer experience across all of our products. We have taken swift and meaningful action to adjust our credit policies to reflect the new environment continuing to lend, but with tightened standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts. We are implementing expense reduction initiatives while preserving key investments that will allow us to grow our business over the long-term and we are prepared for additional actions as the environment evolves.While our capital position is strong, we have suspended our share repurchase program in order to enhance our capital base. Clearly, we will have some challenging quarters ahead, but I am confident that we have taken the correct actions. None of us can perceive when the pandemic impacts will subside and allow the U.S. economy to begin to recover, but Discover is well positioned for the recovery that we know will eventually come. We have a loyal customer base, committed employees and a strong financial foundation to build from as we look to deliver long-term value to our customers and shareholders.That concludes our formal remarks. So I will turn the call back to our operator, Maria to open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Bob Napoli : Thank you and good morning, everybody. Hope everybody is well. A question on your outlook for unemployment and GDP that you are reserving for the life of the loans and I know you gave some numbers, but are you \u2013 can you just go over those numbers for 2020, 2021 and what you are expecting as far as recovery and what effects will that have on loan growth? John Greene : Okay. Thanks Bob. This is John. I will take a shot at that. So there is a wide degree of economic forecast that we took a look at while we are building our models and ultimately our allowance. So what we have built in was unemployment peaking at 9% and staying relatively high through the balance of this year. So about 7% through the end of the year and then it recovers slowly through 2022, so not expecting a real quick recovery and rather slow in our allowances as reflected that dynamic as we modeled it out. The loan \u2013 and your second part of your question on loan growth, the loan growth will be depending on how we see the economy and the recovery proceeding. As Roger mentioned in his comments, we have been cautious coming into this cycle. And when the pandemic hit we have pulled back further, so loan growth will be subject to essentially the recovery of the economy. Bob Napoli : But we would expect to see loans declining I guess from here at least for the next quarter or two, I mean, is that fair? Roger Hochschild : You know Bob there are lot of factors that will go into where loans go. Certainly, the retail spend numbers that I gave you will have a significant impact on that. The credit action and expense actions we have taken will have an impact on loan growth as well. But to John\u2019s point, there is a lot of uncertainty that will be determined by the pace of the recovery. Bob Napoli : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. And I hope you guys are doing well as well. I guess it\u2019s been pretty well documented that since the end of March some of the economic forecasts have actually been revised worse. So, could you just talk about how that might be contemplated in the future whether or not you guys thing it should be? And then also how you guys are incorporating some of these Skip-a-Payment to cure rates and such inside your loss assumptions? John Greene : Okay. Thank you. So there is, as I said in my response to last question is, there is a wide degree of variation on the estimate. So when we put this together, we were looking at what a likely scenario was. Now, the economic backdrop continues to evolve. So we certainly did consider that. There are some overlays related to how we think about recoveries. And certainly, we did put a mild overlay in for the government stimulus programs, but it is uncertain. And if the economy deteriorates further and we don\u2019t see a recovery that will have reserve implications if it runs out as we have modeled that will also play through into the balance sheet in the P&L. So, I know I am not being real specific on your answer, but at this point given the uncertainty, this was our best estimate. In terms of your second part of your question on Skip-a-Pay, so that \u2013 the nature of that program is for card is that an inbound call will happen. The customer, if they are impacted by COVID will get an automatic basically payment deferral. They won\u2019t have to make the payment. If they call back second time, they can get a second deferral on the payment. And after that, they would either pay and go current or continue to kind of roll into delinquency buckets and ultimately charge-offs. So as we provisioned we thought about life of loan provisions and feel like we did a reasonably good job of capturing the dynamics on the portfolio. The one impact on Skip-a-Pay is that if the customer is in trouble and is unable to pay, it will result in up to a 2-month deferral into charge-off just by the nature of how things roll, but I do want to point that just over 80% of those customers who entered into to the Skip-a-Pay program were current at that time. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And just to clarify I guess that the same forecasts you used for your assumptions in the first quarter, have those actually been revised for the worst in early into the second quarter and if everything remain the same, would that mean that there would have to be an additional provision or are you saying that it\u2019s really subjective based on sort of how you are seeing things on fall based on your own forecast? John Greene : Yes. So there is a number of factor and I am not trying to be elusive here, Sanjay, but unemployment and GDP contraction are obviously key inputs. The duration of the slowdown will also be important. Geographic input impacts are important. Job classes are important. So ultimately, it will be a matter of the pace of the recovery, but just to go back and clarify my remarks, so we assumed just over 9% unemployment levels at a peak and then a very, very slow recovery in 2020 and then coming into 2022? Roger Hochschild : And Sanjay, just to build on that, the reserve is calculated at a point in time. And so we will go through a similar process next quarter. My guess is there will be a lot of ups and downs in economic forecast between now and then. And I would contrast that with in terms of how we make our credit decisions that is done on a near continuous basis in a much more granular level. And so we are looking by industry sector, we are looking by geographic area, we are making decisions on who we book, line assignment, how much employment verification we do. So I contrast the reserve calculation with how we are managing credit, which is near continuous. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays. Mark DeVries : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It sounds like your macro assumptions are not too dissimilar from the last recession as far as kind of where unemployment peaks and the pace of the recovery. Yet, the card reserve reflects cumulative losses that are probably less than half of what you are experienced in \u201808/09 timeframe. Could you talk about how the portfolios change in the manner that to make sure you are comfortable that losses won\u2019t approach what we saw in the last recession? John Greene : There is a couple of important pieces related to the portfolio that changed. So Roger mentioned this in his comments in terms of the open to buy. So, the open to buy has reduced by about $54 billion from the last recession to this recession. Average FICO scores in the portfolio have increased between 500 and 600 basis points, which is a material change. Our underwriting frankly is far more sophisticated than it was 10 years ago. And frankly, the actions that this business undertook when the pandemic started to actually drive some real difficult employment numbers, was drastic and very, very quick. So, I don\u2019t know if there is a perfect corollary between the last recession and this recession time will tell, but certainly, I feel like the business is well positioned and took decisive action. And again if the economic outlook changes, we will adjust the reserves and the allowance accordingly. Mark DeVries : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Don, your line is open. Make sure you are not on mute. Don Fandetti : Yes, John. Trying to sort of tie you to a specific number on the stimulus, is it realistic that could you have as you have looked at your scenarios maybe a point or two lower net charge-offs from stimulus? And then secondarily, most financial institutions have said there would probably be another reserve build, a sizable reserve build in Q2, just wanted to \u2013 I know you have talked a lot about it, but is that the case as you sit here today in April? John Greene : So, real difficult to answer at this point. So, we are going to monitor the economy and our portfolio and actually how our customers are performing and make appropriate calls on reserve builds in subsequent quarters. In terms of the government stimulus programs, the impact that we have modeled was relatively modest so I don\u2019t know if I would go to a full percentage point on charge offs but there was a mild impact and as we see that on full it will become more clear. The key thing on the stimulus programs at least initially was would be unemployment checks going out in the $600 as a benefit that\u2019s a front loaded impact and we will have to see how things develop on the back half of the year. Don Fandetti : Okay, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning Roger and John. I was hoping to follow-up on your thoughts about the potential benefit from government relief programs specifically on the Paycheck Protection Program, can you comment on the idea that unemployed consumers were receiving payments under PPP and therefore are not receiving unemployment insurance maybe understanding the true level of initial claims which you guys have always cited as an important leading indicator of credit performance? And then if we extend line of thinking how much of a concern is there that like those receiving unemployment insurance employees participating in PPP faced uncertainty about their employment outlook and still have to make decisions about which builds to pay first, what that means for the unsecured credit card, but just I guess the overall consensus view seems to be that PPP is a positive in the near-term but it is not a longer term fix. I was just hoping that you could maybe speak a little bit more to drag us to a broad potential that the PPP program will benefit your loss experience and you confidence level of that? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Yes, I mean I think all of the government stimulus provides a benefit, but given the depth of the decrease in economic activity, what we all really need is for the economy to start backup again and that will depend on the pace of re-openings in different states and is impossible for us to forecast as we sit here. Some of the traditional relationships may breakdown a bit a lot of initial unemployment claims have been driven by I would say entry level employees in retail restaurant other industries that may have less of a correlation with what we see in our prime card base s o there isn\u2019t necessarily even the same one-to-one interaction that we would have seen in previous downturns where the job mix was different and that job mix may change over time during this recession as well so I would summarize with the government programs are helpful but what we really need is the economy to get going again and so why this will depend on the pace of the recovery/ Bill Carcache : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. I guess maybe if I could just follow-up with the conceptual question on CECL I guess a different way of asking would come up and the idea that if macro conditions were to continue to deteriorate related to your expectations at the end of Q1 at a high level, is it reasonable to expect that we will see additional reserve building? And then therefore when condition start deteriorating we will start seeing additional reserve building and maybe a kind of another way to ask that as if you can envision a scenario where you will need to continue to build more reserves even after economic conditions start to improve so just trying to get the big picture idea of CECL is going to work? Roger Hochschild : Okay. So big picture if the economic conditions continue to deteriorate there will be two dynamics that are likely to happen one would be CECL life of loan provisions would increase, so the allowance would increase we would also take appropriate actions to ensure that our portfolio was stable and that the lending activity we were doing made sense, so you could expect that the portfolio frankly might not increase and would actually decrease and if that was the case we would see some level of offset as a result of reserve releases tied to the portfolio size or the overall loan size so there is multiple dynamics there that come into play, but I hope that\u2019s conceptually helpful. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : Hi, thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about just the forbearance programs, sorry, firstly, this is Mihir on for Jason. I wanted to ask about the forbearance programs and the Skip-a-Pay? Are you also continuing to look at typical modification programs and can you just help us a little bit with the mechanics in terms of just how you deal with the fact with whether you do a credit limit available to borrow etcetera for those who seek either of these programs? And just how you expect that to lead like if it\u2019s Skip-a-Pay whether you \u2013 will people be transitioning from that if they continue to grow through the delinquency buckets to your other modification programs or is it that once you do the Skip-a-Pay now you don\u2019t \u2013 you aren\u2019t eligible for some of those other programs, so just want to understand a little bit more on how you are dealing with some of the delinquencies? Thank you. Roger Hochschild : Yes, it\u2019s Roger. Let me try it at a high level. As John described, for card, it\u2019s a 2 months program, up to 2 months for Skip-a-Pay, but they do 1 month less than 5% have renewed for the second month. So, we will see how that plays out over time. We do still have our program for customers that need a longer period of assistance. Regulators have been encouraging us and others to maximize the support we provide for customers, but again, I think it really does depend on the pace of recovery. As John pointed out, over 80% of those taking advantage of Skip-a-Pay are current. And so our hope would be and again that\u2019s why we have modeled it after some of the disaster relief programs we traditionally had that they will require a shorter bridge and then we will be able to get back to paying their builds, if not we have longer term programs to assist them. Mihir Bhatia : And just \u2013 sorry just to clarify on that one, do you do anything with the longer \u2013 with Skip-a-Pay that there is no change to their credit limits available to borrowers, etcetera, correct? Roger Hochschild : No, for those who have signed up for Skip-a-Pay, it does not impact their credit limits. Mihir Bhatia : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Thank you for all the information on the Skip-a-Pay. I am curious what you are seeing in terms of payment behaviors for consumers who are on Skip-a-Pay programs. Are you seeing an increase in consumers who are making minimum payments on a monthly basis? John Greene : So, we are still [Technical Difficulty] pattern to emerge and part of it is driven by the drastic reduction in sales volume that you have seen. But I would say that reduction in sales is relatively equal across transactors and revolvers. And so it\u2019s balanced in that way, but what happens with payment rate, I think will be determined on how quickly those sales ramp up, some people making larger payments and you can see from the inflow into our deposit products, there are lot of households were still okay, but are looking to fortify their position. So I think it\u2019s too early to really pick out a pattern in terms of the impact of all these changes on payment rate. Rick Shane : Got it, okay. And look we share your view on looking at this in the context of a natural disaster in terms of how the challenges emerge, but one thing that historically has been subsequent to a natural disaster are significant insurance payments into those regions, which create things like huge cash inflows we have seen deposit spikes associated with that. I don\u2019t necessarily think that we are going to see that this time. Is it your view that, that will actually change the post event payment behavior and credit characteristics? Roger Hochschild : There is a lot of speculation out there. In some ways, this is like a natural disaster, in other ways, there is a big debate in terms of the resurgence of economic activity that you get from rebuilding after disaster. You won\u2019t quite have that here. And so is the economic \u2013 people aren\u2019t going to go to twice as many restaurants. And so is that economic activity just lost? I would say probably while you don\u2019t have the degree of insurance payments, you do have an unprecedented amount of governmental assistance and my guess is you will continue to see additional programs. So that is probably bit of an offset compared to what you would have seen coming out of insurance. Rick Shane : Got it. Hey, thank you for taking my questions and we wish everybody their health and safety. Thank you. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, Rick. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Sandler. Kevin Barker : Thanks. Just maybe with regards to the liability side of the balance sheet, are you seeing changes in behavior on your deposit buys and what are your expectations going into the second and third quarter on just overall deposit growth given the different stimulus checks combined with the stress across unemployment, I know it\u2019s difficult to really pinpoint it, but it seems like there could be a lot of overlays where we might actually see a little bit of pickup in deposits and then maybe a decline. Can you just give us a little idea on your expectations there? John Greene : Yes. So I think supply and demand are starting to come into balance, but it\u2019s going to take another quarter or so. The appetite for our deposit products has actually been very, very good. We have traditionally been second or third on the bank rate table. We have been \u2013 recently been a little bit more aggressive on the downward side based on the overall demand for our products. So I think certain people are coming out of equities and looking for a safe place to put their cash. I think other folks have looked at our offerings and our service levels and decided that we are a good spot and they have chosen us. So as we look forward in future, I will say, future quarters, it will be subject to a couple of things. So the supply and the demand factors, what our competitors are doing and then obviously our performance, but we look to kind of move on the deposit pricing to actually pullback some of the NIM that was impacted by the Fed actions. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then in regard to some of the programs that you laid out with the $400 million expense savings, could you assume that, that\u2019s off of what your previous guidance was or is that slightly separate from? What do you expect? John Greene : No, thank you. Yes, that was off the previous guidance. And as we said when we issued it was \u2013 it would be based on a strict payback analysis. So are we going to get long-term returns for the incremental investment with the economic backdrop changing we of course made the appropriate decisions. Kevin Barker : Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht of Jefferies. John Hecht : Good morning guys and thanks very much for taking my questions. The first question is where are we on utilization rates and average balances and how did that compare to maybe a period like entering the vast recession? Roger Hochschild : I am sorry can you repeat the first part of that question? John Hecht : Utilization. Roger Hochschild : Utilization rates. So as you look at overall utilization rates for the portfolio, I think we show that the amount of contingent liability, i.e., the ratio of, which is kind of the opposite of utilization, is significantly down from prior years. So, one as part of the credit tightening that we have done over the last several years, a key component has been tightening contingent liability and tightening that exposure? John Hecht : Okay, thank you. And then currently quantify the effects of the rate changes in March yet, how much of the impact to benchmark rates did you see in the quarter, I know it was later in the quarter and what do we think about NIM trends over the next quarter or two? John Greene : Okay. So we didn\u2019t see any impact in the quarter from the said reductions at the end of March. So there is about 150 basis points of reduction. So we have \u2013 we are not giving guidance but I am going to give you a couple of points in terms of how to think about it. So the 150 basis points hit, there is an impact for three quarters of the year on that. Our deposit betas have traditionally been about 50%. We took some proactive steps early in the year reducing overall deposit rates by 20 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the product. And then we are pulling back on the promo mix, which should also help rates. So you put those factors together and I think it draws a picture of how our NIM could look for the year. Now the quarterly trends are going to be a little bit different based on what\u2019s happening in the particular quarter on revolver and transactor mix. John Hecht : Perfect. Thank you guys very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. Roger, maybe as you kind of sit and think and obviously you are going to be doing less marketing but you\u2019re going to be doing it kind of in a different mix of products. And as you think about Discover\u2019s product set and service niche, kind of how do you think about what you are going to be doing and where there are opportunities to capitalize, and maybe if you could also just throw in thoughts on rewards competition in this environment as well? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Yes, thanks Moshe for the question. One of the things we\u2019re trying to do is keep an eye on the opportunity in this environment. And so even as we\u2019ve made cuts we continue to make investments as well that will strengthen Discover, build the brand, and make sure we\u2019re in great shape for the future. So we\u2019re excited about the partnership with Quibi that just launched. Products such as our Miles Card where you have the ability to redeem at Amazon and PayPal, that\u2019s a lot more useful than programs that were structured just around travel. Our third quarter promotion is for restaurants, for the 5% program. We think that will resonate very, very well. And our rewards rate and product is really structured well for a wide variety of scenarios. So for example, issuers that have big sign up bonuses, they are having to extend the period to earn those because of the reduced level of retail sales and complaints from their customers where ours is just a flat match for the first year of spending. So we\u2019re very excited about where our products are positioned. We\u2019ve talked a lot about the traction we\u2019re getting in deposits. I also think a lot of our messages really will resonate in this environment. Who wants to waste money on a credit card with an annual fee? And we\u2019re the only one with only no annual fee products. So we\u2019re really excited about some of the opportunities we\u2019re seeing in this environment. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. I would assume that you would expect better \u2013 whether it\u2019s a response rate or conversion rates and things, you know like that in this \u2013 while marketing is lower you might have some of that? Roger Hochschild : Yes, we are seeing \u2013 and some of it plays out in the personal loan space for example, some of the traditional competitors and the fin-techs who do not have robust funding models are cutting very, very aggressively. So even with reduced marketing, we\u2019re still hoping to generate good results. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning, and thanks for all the comments. A couple of questions. Just one earlier, I think you mentioned something about how this recession is going to be very different from previous ones in part because of the quick job losses and then expected recoveries. Do you know the job types by customer that you have? Roger Hochschild : We get it at the time of underwriting so some of it can drift over time. It varies a bit by product. We have much better information for the personal loan customers, is an example. We don\u2019t have our student loan customers given they haven\u2019t been employed. So it does vary, but I would say, we have very strong for personal loans and a good amount on the card portfolio. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then separately on the reserving as you know, folks like us who are looking at the reserve levels relative to the 2018 bank loan stress test just to get a sense as to how you are comping this upcoming recession versus that stress loss scenario that you ran a couple of years ago? And when we look at that the credit card reserve that you\u2019ve taken is running, if my math is right, around 45%ish of that stress loss period, but the other consumer is running much higher. And on the other consumer products I think it averages around high \u201880%s, low \u201890%s. So I was just wondering is there a reason why you feel this kind of recession is going to be tougher on that other consumer and does it have to do with your answer you just gave or is there anything else there? Roger Hochschild : I would say it really has to do with more technical differences between the nature of those two different stresses. A lot of it has to do with when a recovery comes in. So just comparing scenarios based on peak loss can give you different numbers. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s anything different we\u2019re seeing by asset class. It\u2019s more technical based on those scenarios. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just two other quick ones, when people sign up for Skip-a-Pay, and let\u2019s say they go for the one month, is it automatic that they can go for the two months or they have to call in every time or check it on the e-mail? Roger Hochschild : Yes, Betsy, they have to call in on the card side. Betsy Graseck : Okay, alright. And I guess with the call times being extremely low, that\u2019s not going to be a challenge for them. And then lastly, on the forbearance side with the call-ins that you\u2019ve been receiving, from the slide deck, obviously, it shows that the beginning of April was the peak and I got a few questions overnight. Why do you think that\u2019s the case that the requests for Skip-a-Pay have already started to decelerate at a time when unemployment claims are still rising here? John Greene : Yes, that\u2019s a good question. Some of it could be related to the government stimulus programs and then it could be just the cycle. We do expect the trend to decline and then a modest pick up as they approach into the second month for certain customers, but we will have to see. Roger Hochschild : Yes, I mean, I guess I would probably point to, a), people may have a better feel of what stress is coming their way even before they\u2019re actually unemployed and so they may have called us, knowing that their boss say, hey, we got one week left and then we\u2019re closing down. So there isn\u2019t necessarily that line of sight. The second thing, my personal view is unemployment claims have actually been gated by capacity to process as opposed to each week 6 million people are losing their jobs. And so, that\u2019s why we would have seen the bubble earlier, because we didn\u2019t have that same capacity constraint that I believe you\u2019ve seen around unemployment claims. Betsy Graseck : Okay. That would be great. It would be great to update that as you get in front of people to over the quarter. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meng Jiao of Deutsche Bank. Meng Jiao : Hey, good morning guys. One quick question, I guess on the Skip-a-Pay payment. Can you guys give further demographics, I guess on what you\u2019re seeing in these customers? I mean, is it-is it safe to assume that the lower FICO score customers are the ones currently enrolling in the Skip-a-Pay payments or is that too much of a generalization? Roger Hochschild : I would say, we talked about over for a card at least over 80% are current. They are relatively highly utilized in terms of the amount of balance. But there\u2019s actually a mix of some that are transactors as well historically in that. So that\u2019s probably the information we\u2019re willing to provide at this time. Meng Jiao : Okay. Thank you. Craig Streem : Maria, our last question. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair. Bob Napoli : [Technical Difficulty] Roger Hochschild : Bob, you are very hard to hear. Bob? Bob Napoli : [Technical Difficulty] John Greene : Yes, hey, Bob, I am sorry, hey, this is John. Craig Streem : Maria, it sounds like we may have a line crossed or some other call. I am not sure if that\u2019s the questioner. Something sounded really strange there. Operator : And I went ahead and removed Bob from the queue. Craig Streem : Okay. And you can prompt if there is anything else and if not, we will terminate the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And I am showing no further questions sir. I would like to turn it back over for management for any additional or closing remarks. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, Maria. Everybody, thank you for your attention, your interest this morning and we will talk to you again as needed. Thanks. John Greene : Stay safe. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the first quarter 2020 Discover Financial Services conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2020 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now like to turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Craig Streem : Christ, thank you very much. And welcome, everybody, to our call this morning. We will begin on Slide 2 of the earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in today's earnings press release and the presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild, and of course John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. And after we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for Q&A Session. And we ask you please, to limit yourself to one question, and if you have a follow-up we'd like you to queue back in towards the end and we'll try to accommodate as many participants as we can. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks Craig. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. On last quarter's call, we discussed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, customers, and business. While I am pleased with our execution in the second quarter, we remain in a very challenging environment with considerable uncertainty as our country continues to struggle to stop the spread of COVID-19 and the impact on our economy remains very significant. Of course, the safety of our employees continues to be a top priority. All areas of the firm, including our hundred percent U.S.-based customer service team are operating effectively in a remote environment. And we have informed employees they will not be required to return to our physical locations until after January 1, 2021 at the earliest. Our operating model supports our commitment to providing flexible work arrangements as long as necessary to ensure the safety of our staff and their families. For our customers we continue to provide an industry-leading service experience, leveraging our digital capabilities and with average answer times in our call centers remaining at pre-pandemic levels of under one minute. Our products are well positioned as consumers increasingly look for value in these challenging times. We are the only major bank with no annual fees on any of our credit cards and no fees on any of our deposit products. Our leadership position in cash rewards and flexible redemption options, including point-of-sale with Amazon and PayPal are serving us well as consumers are increasingly shopping online and concerns over the safety of travel are limiting the appeal of airline miles. We have continued to support impacted customers with our Skip-a-Pay programs. Since we launched this program in mid-March we have helped over 662,000 customers across all of our products. And in fact, about 60% of total loans enrolled have already exited the program. The Skip-a-Pay program was intended to be a short term option, and we plan to end program enrollments in August. After that, we'll continue to offer assistance to those who qualify on a customer-by-customer basis. Now to our results for the quarter. We generated a net loss of $368 million or $1.20 per share. The most significant driver of this was a $1.3 billion reserve build in recognition of further deterioration in the macro economic outlook, subsequent to March 31. The credit performance in our portfolio has been stable, and we believe that the actions we've taken over the past few years, including reducing our contingent liability and the additional credit actions we implemented in March position us well. Nevertheless, the reserve build reflects our view that persistent, long-term unemployment will increasingly impact prime consumer lending portfolios. The pandemic continued to have a significant impact on sales volume, as well as loan growth through the quarter. We saw sales down 16% and 3% lower car loans, while down year-over-year, both compared favorably versus other issuers, principally due to our greater concentration in every day and online spend categories, as opposed to T&E. Operating expenses of $1.1 billion were flat to the prior year and included a $59 million onetime impairment charge to our Diners business, related to the impacts of the slowdown in global teeny spending. Excluding this operating expenses were down 6% year-over-year. We remain on track to deliver the $400 million of expense reductions we previously announced, even as we continue to invest in core capabilities, including analytics and data science. We expect these investments to strengthen our ability to achieve profitable growth and shareholder value to improve targeting and personalization, better underwriting decisions and enhanced collection strategies, just to name a few of the benefits. We're also responding to shifts in consumer preferences with our investments in contactless and secure remote commerce. Since the end of 2019, we have seen a 70% increase in contactless spending. I'm pleased to say we are on track to have most of our top 200 merchants enabled for contactless in 2020 and to have contactless cards issued to the majority of our card members by the end of the year. Consumers have also shifted to much more online spending, which makes our investments in secure remote commerce and our partnership with the other major networks to implement Click to Pay even more significant. Our disciplined approach to capital management and liquidity remains a top priority for us, particularly in the current environment. We have continued to see very strong demand for our consumer deposit products even as we have been reducing rates. Consumer deposits are now nearly 60% of total funding, and we have reduced our online savings rate 59 basis points since early March. Discover has a very strong financial foundation, loyal customers and a proven business model. I am confident that we have taken the correct actions to strengthen the Discover franchise and we are well prepared to continue to drive long-term value to our shareholders and customers. I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail. John Greene : Thank you, Roger. And good morning, everyone. Taking a look at the quarter, we're pleased with our response to the rapidly shifting economic environment, including taking appropriate actions to manage expense, capital, credit and liquidity. Our capital position combined with advances in analytics and credit risk management put us in great shape to return to profitable growth when conditions are right. Today, a recap of the financial results for the quarter and provide details on our credit performance and loan provisions. Similar to last quarter, I won't review our standard slides on low growth, payment volumes, or revenue and expense, but you can find our traditional disclosures on slides, 11 to 16 in the appendix to this presentation. On Slide 4, looking at key elements of the income statement, revenue, net of interest expense decreased 7% in the second quarter, primarily driven by lower net interest income due to NIM compression and lower net discount and interchange revenue reflecting decreased sales volume. Net interest margin was 9.81% for the quarter, down 66 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by three factors. Average loans were flat year-over-year, reflecting the lower sales volume. Loan yields declined as the average prime rate was 225 basis points lower on a year-over-year basis due to Fed rate cuts in 2019 and a 150 basis points cut in March this year. These were partially offset by lower funding costs. We moved aggressively to reduce our deposit rates. Gross discount and interchange revenue decreased 18%, driven by the decline in sales volume. This was partially offset by a 16% decrease in rewards costs. Other income was up due to a $44 million gain on sale of an equity investment. The provision for credit losses was $2 billion and included net charge offs of $767 million, which were up 7% from last year and a $1.3 billion increase in reserves, primarily due to further deterioration in the economic outlook. I'll provide additional comments on credit with the next slide. Operating expenses were flat to the prior year, but down 6% excluding a one-time item. Marketing and business development expense was 42% lower year-over-year as we responded to the significant slowdown in the U.S. economy. The majority of the expense reduction was in brand marketing and card acquisition costs as we align marketing spend with the impacts of the economic environment and tightened credit criteria. Offsetting this in our Diners Club International business we booked a $59 million non-cash intangible asset impairment charge as a result of the slowdown and cross border travel and entertainment spending. Apart from the one-time impairment charge, we anticipate realizing $400 million of expense reductions from our previous guidance range. We made good progress on the expense front in the second quarter, and we'll continue this momentum through the balance of the year. As the economic environment evolves, we'll continue to monitor and take actions on expenses as conditions warrant. Turning now to Slide 5, showing credit metrics. Credit performance remained stable in the quarter. Card charge-offs increased 41 basis points from the prior year mainly due to seasoning of loan growth. The credit card 30 plus delinquency rate was down 17 basis points from last year and down 45 basis points from the prior quarter. The lower delinquency rate reflects the overall stability of the card portfolio with a very modest impact from the Skip-a-Pay program. Our private student loan portfolio reported strong credit metrics in the quarter with net charge-off nearly flat to the prior year. The 30 plus delinquency rate went down 25 basis points from the prior year and 18 basis points lower than the prior quarter. Credit performance in this product continues to benefit from tight underwriting and a high percentage of co-signed loans. Personal loan net charge-offs decreased 90 basis points year-over-year. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 42 basis points lower than the prior year and down 24 basis points from the prior quarter. These credit metrics benefit from disciplined underwriting and our strong customer service and collection efforts. While the overall portfolio performance has been stable through the second quarter, we do expect to see some deterioration in consumer credit in coming quarters. Moving to Slide 6, which shows our allowance for credit losses. In the quarter, we added $1.3 billion to be allowance primarily due to further deterioration in the macro economic outlook. As we considered the level of allowances needed, we modeled several different scenarios. This scenario to which we gave the greatest weight included a sharp increase in peak unemployment to a rate of 16% recovering to 11% at the end of 2020, followed by a slow recovery over the next few years. We assumed an annualized real GDP decline of 30% quarter-over-quarter or down 10% on a year-over-year basis. The quarterly reserve calculation also included an overlay which considers the impact of the Skip-a-Pay program leveraging our previous experience with disaster relief. We also considered unemployment reports in June and July, which showed higher permanent unemployment and the impact of recent increases in COVID-19 cases. Turning to Slide 7, which detailed sales trends by category through mid-July. Total card sales volume decreased 16% in the second quarter. The greatest weekly decline was in mid-April when total sales were down 33% for the week ending April 18, since then we've seen steady improvement across almost every category as the economy reopened. Sales were down just 3% through the first half of July. Since then we have seen steady improvement across almost every category as the economy reopened. We continue to see positive trends in retail, which were up 7% in the second quarter and 15% in the first half of July. Within the retail category, home improvements has been exceptionally strong up 19% in the quarter on high consumer demand. We also benefited from adding Home Depot to our 5% rewards category. Strong online spending growth also contributed to solid retail sales in the quarter. Travel, restaurants and gas continue to be the most negatively impacted categories. Slide 8 highlights enrollment trends in our Skip-a-Pay program which offers relief to customers experiencing financial stress due to the pandemic. We saw the peak in the cards program during the first week of April at $673 million. First time enrollments have steadily decreased since then. In the week of July 12, enrollment's decreased to just $35 million. To date, we enrolled a total of $3.4 billion in card loans. However, the majority of customers needed only one month of assistance and as of July 13, over 70% of card loans were no longer enrolled. Off those, out of the program approximately 80% have returned to making payments. Moving to Slide 9. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 40 basis points sequentially, mainly due to decline in loan balances. In March, we suspended our share buyback program in response to the economic environment at the time and it remained suspended to-date. We've continued to fund our quarterly dividend at $0.44 per share of common stock in line with requirements provided by our regulators and approved by our Board of Directors. Our preliminary stress capital buffer was set at 3.5% with the final SCB expected towards the end of the third quarter. We will determine our share repurchase and dividend actions subject to the final stress capital buffer, any other regulatory limitations and board approval. Our liquidity portfolio remains strong with $27 billion in liquid assets and has increased over $7 billion from March 31. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have been a leader in reducing rates on our consumer deposit products. Nevertheless, we've continued to see strong demand with average consumer deposits increasing 22% year-over-year and now making up 60% of total funding. We'll continue to look for opportunities to reduce deposit costs. To summarize the quarter we're pleased with our results, given the extremely challenging environment. We took swift action on expenses and are continuing to invest in core capabilities, so we're prepared for the recovery when it comes. Outside of a one-time item, operating expenses were down as we started to benefit from our expense reduction programs. Credit performance remained stable, but some deterioration is expected in the coming quarters. We took a conservative reserving approach and added $1.3 billion to the allowance for credit losses, and finally capital and liquidity both remained strong. While we remain conservative given the continued level of economic uncertainty, we feel good about the actions we've taken to date and the strength of the Discover franchise. Before we open up the call for Q&A, I wanted to announce that after a career in consumer finance, including many years at Discover, Craig Streem has informed us of his desire to retire. I am sure most, if not all of you have interacted with Craig over that time and enjoyed a great relationship with him. He has been an important partner to Roger, our leadership team and for me. He has been a wonderful team member and a terrific help with my transition into the company. Craig is going to continue to lead the IR Team until his successor has been named and is in place. So you will have plenty of opportunity to wish him well, as we all do. That concludes our formal remarks. So I'll turn the call back to our operator to open up the lines for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Good morning. I'm glad you guys are doing well and congratulations, Craig. I guess my questions on the reserve build. I'm curious if you feel like with this reserve build that you're pretty much done provided there's no significant change to the macro outlook. And then I know John, you mentioned the forbearance or the Skip-a-Pay has positively impacted delinquencies by a modest amount. But maybe you could just talk about what will drive the impacts that you are expecting in the next few quarters in credit quality? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Hey, Sanjay its Roger. I'll cover the first part and then pass it to John. So in the reserve we \u2013 I think took a conservative approach and use the \u2013 an economic outlook that was considerably worse than the end of Q1. Under CECL, as you know, right that is reserved for the life of loan for the loans we have on our balance sheet. And so further reserve increases would mean that we add further deterioration in the economic environment or would be based on the growth of the balance sheet as we look ahead. And I'll pass it to John for the second one. John Greene : Yes. So Sanjay, just to echo those comments, we feel very good about the overall reserve and the conservative approach we took especially given when you look at the overall portfolio performance that we've seen today and actions we've taken backs as far as 2017 on the personal loans business. So overall we feel very comfortable with our reserve today. And as the economic conditions unfold, that'll have an impact either plus or minus on the overall reserve. The forbearance programs have acted exactly as we had hoped. They've helped some customers managed through the pandemic and as I said in my prepared remarks, most \u2013 the high majority of the people who entered the card program have exited and are repaying. So a very, very mild impact to delinquency reporting as well. Sanjay Sakhrani : I'm just curious, is there a specific number in terms of the amount of benefit from the forbearance impact? John Greene : Yes. So it's actually relatively small and the delinquency numbers somewhere between 5 basis points and 10 basis points. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Bob Napoli : Thank you, and good morning. Craig, it's been a long time. Congratulations and I hope you have some great plans. We\u2019ve been talking for long time? Craig Streem : Thanks Bob. Yes. Thank you. Bob Napoli : Roger, so you've been with Discover a long-time. You've seen a lot of recession's and changes. I just wanted \u2013 I was hoping you could give some thoughts on what you see are going to be a permanent changes to the industry. And maybe just, I mean, if he could get John, since you could give us some color on how much of your spend today is online and what it was prior to the pandemic? Roger Hochschild : Sure. So I was going to say in my 20 plus years at Discover, I've seen a lot of things, but I've never seen anything like this in terms of this speed and magnitude of the impact the pandemic has had on the economy. I don't think any of us in business has seen this. Nevertheless, I feel like we were very, very well positioned for this going in, and I think over the long-term what you've seen is really an acceleration of some trends that were already there. So the migration out of branch to digital channels, which again as always been part of our business mode. Consumers shifting from physical to digital purchases and there I think our advantage of having our proprietary network and the work we're doing with other major networks on SRC will be helpful. For a physical purchases, the shift to contact less, so those are really some trends that have been there, but have accelerated in a very significant way as a result of the COVID pandemic. John Greene : And Bob, in terms of the sales trends, we haven't \u2013 we haven't broken it down out between brick-and-mortar and online. But what I \u2013 what I can point you to is retail in my prepared comments in terms of the growth we've seen there, a lion's share of that has been as a result of online retailers and you know the major players there, which is driving I\u2019ll say further demise of the brick-and-mortar retailers and accelerating the digital channel for card. Things that Discover offers in terms of the network and our secure remote commerce that we're working on, all those will position us well for that growing trend. Bob Napoli : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Hi, good morning. Kind of a short-term question, and if you could talk a little bit about the NIM outlook in the near-term? And then Roger, longer-term coming out of the credit crisis if I recall you guys came out and took share, and we're positioned pretty well. I know we're in the midst of this, but how are you thinking about the other side of this \u2013 the consumer is going to have a fair amount of savings. And do you look at these types of opportunities as market share gain, or is that too premature to be thinking about that? John Greene : Okay. So when I start with NIM question? So in the first quarter, our NIM was 10.21%, and then in the second quarter it came down to 9.81%. I'm not going to give a bunch of detail here, but what I can say is, we look at the second quarter as likely the trough on NIM overall. What we've been able to do is execute pretty well in terms of deposit pricing and our funding stack has meant such that more expensive funding sources are fading away, and we're getting a benefit there. So since the pandemic, just to give you some details we decreased our online savings by about 60 basis points. That's an immediate benefit to net interest margin in the company. And then through the balance of the year, we're going to continue to look for opportunities. So some of that will be based on the funding of our balance sheet, and some of it will be based on the competitive environment that we're dealing with. Roger Hochschild : Yes. And in terms of gaining share, I think it's never too early to think about that. It feels like we're gaining share in the card business in terms of loans and sales this quarter, from what I've seen from competitors reporting, and that's within the significantly tightened credit box that we have. One of the capabilities we've been working on is, is just the ability to react more quickly and that helped us react very quickly to the pandemic in terms of tightening credit across our products. But that should also help when job losses abate and it becomes time to widen the credit box as well. So we feel good about our capabilities and our ability to gain share across all of our products. Don Fandetti : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. I guess I was \u2013 I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the performance that you've seen with respect to borrowers that are exiting forbearance, and the fact that you're assuming kind of 11% unemployment at year-end. So as we think about the likelihood of either needing more or less reserving like, how do you think about the information that we're going to get over the next several months in terms of how we think about the reserving levels as we go forward? Roger Hochschild : Moshe, thanks for the question. So, and it's a great question, and honestly it's a bit of art and science. So what we have seen in terms of customers exiting is about 80% of those customers are making payments and is \u2013 and close to 80% of those are making full payments. So we're feeling very good about the customers coming out of the programs. Now to be honest, those segments inherently are likely to be a little bit more risky. So we continue to watch the differentiation on customers who elected to enter into one of the Skip-a-Pay programs to see if there's any potential issue, but as you step back from it, the overall size of the portfolio versus the customers who have elected to go into Skip-a-Pay program relatively small, right? So... Moshe Orenbuch : Right. Roger Hochschild : So we're looking at the impact as very, very mild. The delinquency trends have been, from my standpoint very, very encouraging and I think that's, that's a function of some of the government stimulus, function of our collections operations and the value of a credit card overall versus other payment forms or other payment forms as well as what it means in terms of ability to operate in the digital economy. So we like the fact that our portfolio has a high concentration of credit cards, and we also think that we'll come here to the top on the payment prioritization through even a tough downturn. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Roger Hochschild : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Craig, I'm going to miss you. Craig Streem : Likewise Betsy. Thank you. I appreciate that. Thanks. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So back to work. The question I have is just around the reserving level. I know you already addressed one question on that earlier in the Q&A, but I've been getting some investor questions regarding how to think about the reserves that you're building today versus the loss experience you had during the great financial crisis? Now granted it's very different environment, but the unemployment rate is relatively high and a little bit higher than what we had during the GFC. So I thought I'd take the opportunity to ask you how you would answer that question. How should I think about what the right reserving level is for today's book versus the losses that you had during the 2008 crisis? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : So let me start by talking a bit about the unemployment rate and then I'll pass it to John to talk on the reserves. I think the unemployment rate we're seeing now is very different. And we've talked a bit about temporary unemployment, as well as the impact on sort of entry level retail, entry level hospitality, entry level restaurant. And so you can't map total unemployment to loses and a prime card base the way that you saw that pattern in last downturn. And so things like permanent unemployment, you need to adjust to that. And so we're not just looking at the raw unemployment numbers as we do our modeling. I'll pass to John to talk a bit about the reserve. John Greene : And then Betsy, just one other piece and it's a relatively important difference here when you go back in time on the great recession versus where we are today. So, the overall the industry, the quality of the originations is much better today than it was at the great recession or prior to that. In general, higher FICOS across every single form of lending product. Delinquency levels coming into the recession \u2013 this recession versus the Great Recession are lower. Consumer financial obligation load is significantly lower today than it was coming into the Great Recession and debt service load was also lower today. So the consumer is stronger coming into this recession than coming into the Great Recession. The traditional links between unemployment and delinquency and charge-offs, we're trying to model that. It's really hard to nail that down right now, given all the government stimulus. But overall, as I look at where we are today and based on our underwriting and where card loan comes into payment priorities, I feel like we're very, very well positioned versus where the company was coming into the Great Recession. And then we also talked about inactive lines. We've taken inactive lines down nearly numbers close to $70 billion. So we're prepared for the worst, but I feel like we're in a better position. Betsy Graseck : And you've got this really high savings rate going on right now. I mean do you use that in your analysis as a kind of bridge to a lower unemployment rate as you're thinking about reserving? John Greene : Yes. We didn't actually quantify that. But as we were making determinations on economic scenarios and frankly, the overall quantum of reserves and reserve coverage, it was a point that helped us get to where we arrived. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay, thanks very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Yes, thanks. Could you give us a little more color about what we should expect from delinquency and charge-off formation in the coming quarters? And how, if at all, those expectations and your reserve levels are impacted by your expectations for benefits from different forms of government stimulus and different forms of lender forbearance across your customers' different financial obligations? John Greene : Okay. So a tricky question. So I'll start with how we're expecting delinquencies and charge-offs to roll in. So as I said earlier, the books held up really, really well. Delinquency levels have come down. We do think some of that is as a result of stimulus. We also feel like our teams are doing a great job in terms of interacting with our customer base to help the customers get through tough times, those that are experiencing some trouble. The trajectory of charge-offs, based on what we're seeing right now, looks like we would expect elevated charge-offs starting more in the fourth quarter and then coming into 2021. Frankly, it's tough to call right now because we're modeling out unprecedented scenarios here. But I think a good way to think about it is charge-offs elevating in 2021, perhaps peaking in the later part of 2021, depending on the economic scenario that we're dealing with and then starting to tail off in 2022. In terms of delinquency, delinquency will \u2013 we think will start to tick up in the fourth quarter, perhaps as early as the third quarter, but we're not seeing any indicators yet and then continue into 2021. In terms of the government programs, we did nothing in our modeling to reflect what's been kicked around right now in Washington in terms of the next round of stimulus. So I think that could certainly push out the curve a little bit in terms of both delinquency and charge-offs. Roger Hochschild : Yes. I mean, I think, as you think about the importance of the government programs, it's less about the $1,200 check that a family gets as you think about life of loan losses and what that will support. It's really the impact of those on the overall economy and keeping the trough from being too deep. So to John's point, we really think about it just in terms of at a macro level as opposed to what those checks may do in one month for a given household. Mark DeVries : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank. Meng Jiao : Hi, good morning guys. A quick question, I guess, on the average balance sheet. I saw that average cash and securities were up materially this quarter. Just trying to get a sense on how you guys are thinking about the securities portfolio and whether or not you would extend duration to pick up some yield given the NIM at trough in 2Q? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Yes, we\u2019ve been pleased with how \u2013 actually, how the balance sheet has come together. Certainly, the asset side has been strong as we talked about in the prepared comments. On the liability side, we've seen great appetite on our \u2013 for our deposit products, which is positive. We have also been able to avoid wholesale funding. We're not looking to substantially change any of the duration of any of the liabilities that we see on the balance sheet. We've effectively added interest rate, basically a balanced interest rate risk position. So we're feeling good about that. Craig Streem : Cristal? Operator : Your last question comes from the line of line of Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Kevin Barker : Good morning. So we've seen a lot of controversy around the dividend on with several competitors or even some other banks. I was just wondering how much \u2013 how you think about the dividend going forward and how much of a priority is to maintain it given some shareholders look at it as important or just maybe how you think about it, given the trajectory of your earnings? John Greene : Yes, so I would guide you to sort of looking back over the last 10 years where you've seen a very clear strategy from Discover. Given the high returns we generate from our business, an important part of how we manage capital is returning it to shareholders in the form of a dividend, and we've had historically a measured increase to those dividends as well as buying back stock. And we're very disciplined and, to a lesser extent, involved in M&A. So that's what we like to do. I would say until the environment improves, it's quite safe to expect continued heavy regulatory focus on return of capital. And so we will have to adjust our strategies accordingly. Certainly, if they keep going with the four quarters rule, that's something that \u2013 again, it will depend going forward, but that's something that we've looked at. But I think we're going to watch and work with our regulators on this, but management's intent is unchanged. And so we'll have to see how it goes. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then regarding your comments on the charge-off rate peaking into late 2021, I mean, I think, we would have expected a little bit more of a big bulge coming out of the deferral periods and the expiring of a lot of the stimulus. Could you just talk about how the \u2013 what the cycle is going to look like or how you envision it playing out with charge-offs playing out in the early 2021? And then what it looks like in the back half? Roger Hochschild : Yes. So we're seeing that the portfolio continues to be really, really stable, as I said. The payment programs, we saw obviously, the disclosed level of entries into the programs and then a surprisingly high number from our perspective exiting after one payment, which to me was a good sign. As they exited, the payment percentage or payment rate of those customers has held up very, very strong. So we're comfortable with that. So if you just look at where we are as of June 30 and then just do a kind of straight role model it out, it's hard to see any massive increases in charge-offs for the balance of the year even if things deteriorate from the consumer standpoint. So that means what we're likely to see is charge-offs grow through the year slowly and then, I wouldn't call it a bulge, but a higher level of overall charge-offs in the middle to second half of 2021. Now that's what \u2013 that's how we're seeing it today. I certainly would caveat that and say that consumer behavior is really difficult to predict here in a time such as this. Sorry, I can't be more specific on that. Kevin Barker : Yes, it\u2019s very uncertain time, I understand. Thank you. Operator : I will now turn the floor back over to Craig Streem for any additional closing remarks. Craig Streem : Thanks Cristal. Just thank you, everybody, for your interest. As always, we're available, get back to us if you need any follow-up. Thanks. Have a good day. Roger Hochschild : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2020 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Craig Streem, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Craig Streem : Thank you, Maria. And good morning, everybody. Welcome to today\u2019s call. We will begin this morning on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in today's earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild, and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. And after we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for question and answer session. During the Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question, and if you have a follow-up please queue back in so we can accommodate as many participants as possible. And now as always it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thank you, Craig. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. In these uniquely challenging times, I'm pleased with Discover\u2019s results and how well our business model has performed. In the third quarter, we are in $771 million after tax or $2.45 per share. We clearly benefited from the actions we took in the first half of this year to protect employees, manage credit risk, and control costs while preserving momentum on long-term investments. While significant uncertainty remains as to the extent and timing of a recovery, we were pleased to see the return to year-over-year sales growth in September. Managing credit remains a top priority. We entered this recession from a strong credit position due to our traditionally conservative approach to underwriting as well as actions taken over the past few years to reduce our contingent liability and tighten credit at the margin. We quickly implemented changes to credit policy at the onset of the pandemic, including tightening criteria for new accounts in line increases and additional income verification. While we saw very strong credit performance this quarter, we expect to see deterioration in the coming quarters as the prime consumer may be impacted by increasing permanent white collar unemployment. That said, we believe we have taken the appropriate credit actions and don't see the need to make significant changes at this time. The improvements in sales volume continued during the quarter with a return to growth in the month of September. Sales have improved across all categories with particular strength in online retail, home improvement, and everyday spend categories partially offset by continued weakness in travel and entertainment spending. Loan growth continues to be affected by the pandemic, with total loans down 4% year-over-year, including card loans down 6% and personal loans down 5%. The drop in spending during the pandemic and our own credit tightening has impacted loan growth. But another driver has been a significantly higher payment rate in our card and personal loan portfolios. Consumers have had improved household cash flows due to reduced spending and government stimulus and have taken this opportunity to boost savings and make larger payments against their loans. In our student loan business, originations in the peak season were down year-over-year, reflecting the large number of students who chose not to enroll this fall. Even in this challenging environment, our organic student loans were up 7% reflecting innovative features like our multiyear loan and our strong competitive position. In terms of operating expenses we remain on track to deliver $400 million of cost reductions this year, while continuing to invest in core capabilities, such as advanced analytics to increase efficiency and drive long-term value. In conclusion, this quarter our business generated high returns as we remained focused on discipline credit management, profitable growth, and an industry leading customer experience supported by our 100% U.S. based customer service. The economic environment remains uncertain but our strong capital and liquidity and the actions we've taken to strengthen the business position allows us to continue to drive long-term value for our shareholders. I\u2019d now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail. John Greene : Thank you, Roger. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I\u2019ll walk through our results, starting on Slide 4. We earned $2.45 per share driven by solid credit performance of our portfolio and significantly lower operating expenses. While total revenue was down from last year reflecting the slowdown in the economy, sales volume turned positive in September and net interest margin expanded nicely. Net interest income was down 6%, as the impact of lower market rates was partially offset by lower funding cost. In addition, average receivables were down 3% contributing to the decline in net interest income. Non-interest income was down 10% driven by lower fee income, reflecting fewer late fee incidences and the impact of lower overall spending on cash advance fees. The decrease in net discount and interchange revenue was driven by sales volume in the quarter. The provision for credit loss is improved by nearly $50 million from the prior year as a result of a decline in net charge-offs in a lower reserve build. Operating expenses were down 9% year-over-year driven by marketing expenses and professional fees. Turning to loan growth on Slide 5, total loans were down 4% from the prior year driven by a 6% decrease in card receivables. Lower card receivables were driven by three factors, a higher payment rate as customers continue to be mindful of their debt obligations. A decline in promotional balances as a result of credit tightening, which will benefit net interest margin going forward. And third, lower sales volume. In the quarter sales were down just 1% on a year-over-year basis. Sales returned to growth in September up 4% year-over-year, with improvement in all categories, grocery, retail and home improvement were very strong. The trend continued through the first half of October with sales up 7%. In our other lending products, organic student loans increased 7% from the prior year and personal loans decreased 5%. Moving to Slide 6, our net interest margin bottomed out in the second quarter and improved 38 basis points to 10.19% in the current quarter, relative to the second quarter NIM increased primarily due to favorable consumer deposit pricing. Since June 30, we have decreased our online savings rate 41 basis points down to [0.60%]. Approximately two-thirds of our consumer deposits are indeterminate maturity accounts, primarily savings, which has provided an immediate benefit from deposit rates decreases. Average consumer deposits were up 22% year-over-year, and up $2.7 billion from the second quarter. Looking at Slide 7, you can see how our funding mix has changed overtime. We're also providing details on our funding maturities and corresponding rates over the next couple of years. Given our current excess liquidity position, we expect to issue very little wholesale debt in the near-term. The majority of our new deposits have been in online savings. And we would expect this trend to continue in the current low rate environment. As we move towards our target at 70% to 80% of funding from consumer deposits, we expect to see continued benefits to net interest margin. Turning to Slide 8, total operating expenses were down $102 million or 9% in the prior year. Marketing and business development expense was down $90 million or 39%. The bulk of the reduction was in brand marketing and card acquisition. Professional fees decreased $38 million or 20% mainly driven by lower third-party recovering fees related to foreclosure, as well as favorable vendor pricing adjustments. Employee compensation was up $32 million or 7% driven by staffing increases mainly in technology, as well as higher average salaries and benefit costs. To date, we've realized approximately 90% of the targeted $400 million of expense reductions we discussed over the past two quarters. We are on track to deliver the remaining 10% in the fourth quarter and continue to review the business for efficiency opportunities. Turning now to Slide 9 showing credit metrics. Credit performance remained very strong in third quarter. Cards net charge-offs dollars actually came down $7 million, while the rate increased 13 basis points Sequentially, the card net charge-off rate improved 45 basis points. The 30 plus delinquency rate improved 59 basis points from last year and 26 basis points from the prior quarter as credit performance of our card portfolio continued to be stable, demonstrating the strength of our prime revolver customer base. Our private student loan portfolio had another quarter of strong credit performance with net charge-offs down 1 basis points compared to the prior year. Excluding purchase loans, the 30 plus delinquency rate improved 37 basis points from the prior year and 8 basis points sequentially. Credit performance in our personal loan portfolio continued to be very strong this quarter, reflecting our disciplined underwriting and the benefit of credit actions implemented over the past several years. Net charge-offs improved 130 basis points and the 30 plus delinquency rate was down 39 basis points from the prior year. While overall credit performance remained strong through the third quarter, we expect the economic environment to lead to deterioration and consumer credit, with delinquencies slightly increasing in 2021. The timing of the rise in delinquency and subsequent losses could be impacted if there is a second government stimulus program or economic trends shift materially. Slide 10 shows our allowance for credit losses. In the quarter we added $42 million to the allowance driven by a $354 million increase in organic student loans. Other loan products were generally flat from the prior quarter. With the backdrop of an uncertain by improving macroeconomic environment, we modeled several different scenarios and maintained a conservative view in the quarter. Our key macro assumptions were an unemployment rate of 11% at the end of 2020 and slowly recovering over the next several years. We also considered the current trends in unemployment and the increasing number of COVID cases. Moving to Slide 11, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased 50 basis points sequentially, primarily due to the decline in loan balance. In March, we suspended our share buyback program in response to the economic environment at that time and it remained suspended. We have continued to fund our quarterly dividend at $0.44 per share. We are in the process of preparing our second stress test submission and will determine our share repurchase and dividend actions subjected to the final stress capital buffer, regulatory and rating agency expectations and Board approval. In summary, solid results in the third quarter. The portfolio remained stable with improvements in overall delinquency levels. Reserves are flat except for those pertaining to student loans where the balance and commitment levels increased. Net interest margins improved from the second quarter and is trending positively as a result of our aggressive deposit pricing. And finally, strong execution on our targeted expense reductions. With that, I'll turn the call back to her operator Maria to open up the lines for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning and good quarter. Appreciate all the color on reserves and provisions. Roger, clearly there's nothing that we see within the credit metrics. That suggests a weakness outside of the headlines on potential white collar layoffs. Are there any specific signs that you're seeing inside the portfolio that lead you to be concerned? And how significant the change in the environment would there have to be for you guys to have to build reserves again. Roger Hochschild : So I'll let John to cover the part about reserves Sanjay. But in terms of the environment, I think that the jobless claims numbers and we'll see what this week has but seven straight weeks over [800,000] and more and more of that permanent unemployment and white collar is a reason for ongoing concern. But I think as you look at our portfolio, I'm very pleased with the performance across all products. And you can see that from the broadest metric, we just close the 30-day delinquency rate. John Greene : Yes, and Sanjay, in terms of reserving, we modeled a number of different assumptions and took conservative approach across the board. What we saw was actually, as Roger said, excellent underlying portfolio performance. There is, there is a level of concern in terms of jobless claims and the impact on prime consumers. But today, we don't see anything that -- that's out there that would suggest that reserves are -- I'll say weak or deep strengthening at this point. We did model a second round of stimulus. We don't know if that's going to happen. There's some reason to be optimistic, but no one can tell that on this sorts of things these days. So we'll say, but what we'll look at through the quarter, the fourth quarter, and make a call in terms of what's appropriate from a GAAP standpoint. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from one of Rick Shane of JP Morgan. Rick Shane : Thanks, guys, and good morning. Look, we're entering, what's historically the most important part of the year in terms of spending in consumer behavior? I'm curious -- two things you're seeing an uptick in spending, which is a good sign. I'm curious how you will approach this from a marketing and rewards perspective, we know you pull back a little bit to this point to manage expenses. But given the consumer seems to be rebounding, will you be a little bit more aggressive on rewards or marketing as we head into the holiday season? Roger Hochschild : Yes, thanks, Rick. In terms of marketing, while we did cut expenses, in line with the economic environment, we have continued to market across all of our products, and have been very excited actually about the quality of new accounts we're bringing in on the card book, as well as some of the costs we're seeing as competitors pulled back more aggressively. Now, I do expect some of that to normalize over time. But again, we're going to continue marketing through the fourth quarter. In terms of the rewards program, so our program is well suited to this environment. Consumers prefer cash over miles. I think a lot of the miles programs I see in the marketplace are struggling to add relevance and redemption options. And in particular, our strong partnerships with PayPal and Amazon, some of the programs we're already putting in market with Amazon will serve us well in the fourth quarter. Rick Shane : Great. That's very helpful. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Hi, good morning. So Roger, I mean these are the times where you can potentially step in and gain share and be opportunistic. We saw American Express buy Kabbage, do you have any thoughts on your position of strength? How you could use that maybe on acquisitions or you going to just sort of hold tight given the uncertainty? Roger Hochschild : Yes. I think we are leveraging that position of strength. I believe we're gaining share both in terms of sales and loans and card and had a very strong peak season for student loans. Acquisitions are a little more challenging. And so as we think about how we use capital, the top priority is supporting organic growth. Next comes a mix of dividends and buybacks. Acquisitions tend to be a distant third, our primary interest is in the payment space. But while valuations have come in a bit, especially where cross border type of company, they're still very high. And so a lot of what we're seeing opportunities for either investments, partnerships, so we'll look at it, but I think we're probably more likely to be aggressive on the organic side, subject to our conservative credit policy than making acquisitions. Don Fandetti : Okay, just one quick clarification. What percentage of the portfolio is promo right now? Because it sounds like that's going to help on the card yield going forward? John Greene : Yes, it's come down recently. We've been intentional about that in terms of taking a look at promo balances as well as balance transfers. So\u2026 Don Fandetti : And so I think -- usually you guys are in the mid teens or somewhere in that range? John Greene : Yes, it's, right around 15 or so. Don Fandetti : Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning, Roger and John. It's encouraging to see positive operating leverage in this environment. That's consistent with what we've seen over the last decade plus from you guys, but there had been some concern among investors when you guys gave guidance earlier this year pre-COVID that is cover may have lost its expensive discipline and that the reason that you guys had at the time guided to negative operating leverage was due to years of chronic underinvestment? Roger, understanding that there will always be one-off investments that need to be made. But that aside, you speak to your confidence level and being able to continue to generate consistent positive operating leverage as we look to the other side of this? Roger Hochschild : Yes, thanks, Bill. So first, having been here for over 20 years, I have to maybe disagree with the phrase chronic underinvestment, I think our investments have been appropriate. But at the beginning of the year, we saw an opportunity to invest more. And so I would characterize it that way. Clearly, the year changed dramatically. And hopefully, you've seen very strong expense discipline in terms of the target we put out there and how well we're progressing against that target. It's a little challenging just to look at operating leverage, because that includes well of course day-to-day corporate type expenses that we're always trying to bring down. But then also marketing investments that drive profitable growth and high returning accounts. And so it's a blend of those two. But again, I think you can expect to see the continued expense discipline that I think has always been a hallmark here to discover our overall lower cost operating model. But we will invest according to the opportunities we see in the marketplace. And I guess I'd point you to the returns we're generating as an example of the effectiveness of that business model even through extremely challenging cycles. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning, guys. Roger Hochschild : Good morning. John Greene : Good morning. Ryan Nash : John, on net interest margin, you saw some really nice expansion. You talked about, the benefits that you're seeing from lower promo activity. Can you maybe just talk about some of the puts and takes from here as the yields are obviously going to be improving? And it seems like the funding tailwinds are sizable over the next couple of quarters. So if we had peaked out in the low to 40s, could we actually, potentially see the margin, somewhere in excess of that over the next few quarters? John Greene : Yes. So, we were mindful in terms of what we included here in the presentation as well as in terms of the comments. To provide, frankly, an additional insight in terms of what's happening to the funding mix, maturity profile, and the cost of our dead stack and what you can see there is based on the maturity profile, and the cost we're seeing versus online deposits, that there will be an opportunity to expand net interest margin. Now, that subject to a lot of different things, right, obviously, there's one piece, which is the health of the portfolio. And that's been strong. Certainly, the mix of revolvers and transactors will also have an impact and typically impacts the fourth quarter a bit. But, overall, as you look at where we are this quarter, I see some upside from that, from my advantage point today. Ryan Nash : Got it. And maybe if I can ask a follow-up question from a topic that was hidden before. So John, I think in your prepared remarks, you commented that you're looking for additional efficiencies, maybe can you just help us understand and maybe Roger can hop in on this too, of the 90% of the $400 million that you've saved? How much of that was just investments that have been deferred versus actual core efficiencies that you guys have identified and taken out? And, what could this mean for the trajectory of the cost base outside of marketing as we look into 2021? Thanks. John Greene : Yes. So thanks. So I would characterize it this way is the $400 million of cost savings from the previous guidance. I wouldn't necessarily call that a deferral, what I would say is, we took a look at the economic environment and took $400 million for planned spending. Now, as I said in the March remarks, which you clearly picked up and Ryan was that the bulk of that has been on marketing and brand. Now as we look through the balance of this year, and some of the actions that we took, we saw benefits across the host of P&L line, expense line specifically. And we're going to use that frankly as a new benchmark in order to really make some determinations on what we need to spend in 2021 to ensure that we continue to grow profitably. I would say that if the economic environment continues to improve, it's natural that we're going to spend more money on customer acquisition in order to drive profitable growth into the future. But the other expense lines, professional fees, information processing other miscellaneous expense, we're going to keep a foot on those to ensure that we're disciplined about how we're spending the dollars. Ryan Nash : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I guess, I sort of I am struck by the fact that the efficiency ratio in the quarter was actually better than it was in 2019. And you're kind of demonstrating, certainly likely to be the best growth and spend volume and one of the better growths if not the best in receivables or smallest decline. And I guess I'm also struck by stuff we see in the industry, that there's continued more cash back mail from some of your big competitors were that wasn't as bigger focus. And so, kind of maybe, some of this has been discussed already. But I'm sort of struck by that, it seems like you have an opportunity. And, where does -- where can you direct that attention? And, how much do you have in kind of available whether it's spending on rewards or marketing, like, what are the tools? And how are you going to use them over the next few quarters, particularly now, as we're going into the holiday season? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Yes, thanks Moshe. We're using all the tools we have available, I would point out there's still a good amount of economic uncertainty. And so we are not changing credit policy on the card side, I think we want to see more signs of sustained recovery. But the cash back program is resonating well as I said earlier. And there's always a lot of competition in cash rewards from major issuers. So I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as more intense than ever, but it is a time where consumers are rethinking which cards they want, do they really need another frequent flyer miles at this point. And then the other part is the only major issue with no fees on any of our card products, but knowing you'll see, message resonates surprisingly well. But then [indiscernible] we're seeing great strength on the other side of the balance sheet on the deposit side, where we compete the same way, right, good value, but an outstanding customer experience. So we're really excited. Certainly uncertainty as to what the holiday season will bring, as I talked to retailers out there. But I feel good about our ability to continue to gain share. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Sandler. Kevin Barker : Good morning. I just like to follow up on some of the NIM comments. You're seeing some a little bit more resiliency on the asset yields, in particular, from the personal loans and card rates. Could you talk about, the competitive environment in both those products and your expectations for those yields at least in the next couple of quarters, just given the resiliency that we've seen in the near-term? John Greene : Yes. So we look at the card yield, that will overall be relatively stable subject to kind of the mix of balance transfers and promos. And as I said earlier we're going to be mindful in terms of those sorts of decisions. If we can do that, do some promos or balance transfers safely in their credit environment we'll do that because it would be high returning by returning customers. But the leverage that we're going to get in future quarters will come out of the funding base. Roger Hochschild : Yes, and Kevin may one thing I'd add to. As we said pricing, given how hard it is to re-price card after the Court Act, we're not reacting to specific competitors in a given quarter. We're taking, working closely with finance a very disciplined through the cycle book and so it's really where our growth is occurring. And that promo mix, it'll drive it as opposed to reacting to competitors. Kevin Barker : Yes, that'll make sense. And then regarding the liability side, the order of magnitude in the drop in liability costs over the last couple quarters are obviously very strong. Just given the rate environment, how much more room do you feel like you have to bring deposit costs lower, just given the current rate environment and the outside liquidity on your balance sheet? John Greene : Yes. So we continue to look at that. And the decision would be subject to two factors, one, the amount of liquidity we have on a balance sheet. And right now we're in a situation we have access to liquidity. And then the second piece of the equation is the competitive landscape. And then third, which is a consideration of the business is certainly the customer relationships and ensuring that our long-term good quality customers aren't feeling like they're impacted in a way that's unfair. Now, with all that said I'm seeing a persistent low rate environment. And with a persistent low rate environment, I do believe that there is some amount of room price downward. But again, it's caveated by all those points that I just mentioned. Kevin Barker : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Napoli of William Blair. Robert Napoli : Thank you and good morning. I just wondered what your built -- what you built into your reserves as far as the trajectory of charge-offs. And I would expect, I mean, I guess you're not really given where delinquencies are, you are not expecting to see charge-offs move up much in the fourth quarter and then more back half weighted to 2021? John Greene : Yes, so I would start off by saying that, the portfolio performance versus what we thought it potentially could be, when we close the book in March has been extraordinarily strong. And we're really, really pleased by that. In terms of trajectory of both delinquencies and charge-offs, yes, we are seeing certainly a push from \u201820 into \u201821. And the absolute quantum of that will obviously depend on all the factors that we built into our reserve calculation, GDP, unemployment, new jobless claims, stimulus, or lack thereof. So we will, we're going to monitor the portfolio, but to kind of net it for you and the other folks that are on the call, \u201820 looks super solid \u201821 level of uncertainty and we expect the bubble to push through into -- certainly, beginning maybe in the midpoint of the year into the second half of \u201821. Robert Napoli : Thank you. And then follow up with just jobless claims 787,000 this morning a big improvement that ridiculously high that's right. But yes, I mean, direct bank your position Roger is a direct bank. It gives and I think it's the right strategy for the long-term. Are there new products or services or then you're planning to build through that direct bank? And when we have, obviously a lot of these Neo banks that are delivering different products, and maybe to different demographic than discover focuses on but where do you see opportunities to leverage off of your direct bank strategy? Roger Hochschild : So in terms of positioning ourselves as the leading digital bank, I think we're in great shape. And it's leveraging the products we already have. I don't see the need for expanding our products. If you look at the breath from home equity to a broad range of deposit products, including checking our debit accounts or great strength of course on the card side, personal loans. So we have the products, I think the opportunity is building awareness of the products we have and that can drive a lot of growth. So I'm very excited about where we're positioned. I'd say maybe one of the big differences versus the Neo banks is perhaps a different focus around profitability. So we'll see how that plays out over the long-term, but I couldn't be more excited about where we're positioned. Robert Napoli : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. [indiscernible] did I hear correctly, you said your [indiscernible] model the second round of stimulus in your modeling for credit? Roger Hochschild : Yes. Yes, we did. There's an input in our modeling, reflecting a second round of stimulus. Mihir Bhatia : And then just one quick one on the -- if you can update on the network business, specifically, I was looking at -- it looks like your volumes are growing very nicely in both [pulse] and network performance. But yet, you attribute the revenue decline to both of those businesses. So I'm just wondering, what is happening there or is it just competitive factors is there a mix issue, just hoping to get a little more color on that? Thank you. Roger Hochschild : Yes. Thanks for the question. So it was actually a combination of two things. So there was a bit of a mix, shift to some products with lower fees and rates. There was also some higher incentives that came through based on the mix that we enjoyed in the quarter. I would say that in terms of overall volume it was up 16%, year-over-year at least for pulse. And certainly, we're happy about that, we are continuing to look at the mix and incentives to ensure we're driving appropriate level of profitability for the investments we're making there in the payments business. Mihir Bhatia : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Roger Hochschild : Good morning Betsy. John Greene : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Couple questions, just first off on the outlook for growth. I know typically, it's a function of account growth and balances per account. And obviously, you've had some shrinkage recently, because of the spend levels that we all know about. I'm just wondering if we could dig into the account growth aspect of that equation, just understand how account growth has been going? What COVID has meant to account growth, how you flexed? And do you see any opportunity to accelerate account growth from here as we go into the back half of the year and into \u201821? Roger Hochschild : Yes, so just one thing on the receivables growth, the higher payment rate is a big factor as well. So good news on what it's doing on the deposit side of our business. But that is having a significant impact on loan growth for both card and personal loans. In terms of new accounts, while we don't disclose a number on that, what I would say is that we think we probably sustained to account marketing, more than a lot of competitors as I look at industry metrics. And so we feel good about that, and kept our marketing spend sort of appropriate for the environment and for our somewhat narrowed credit box with the changes we made earlier in the year. So I would not expect dramatic changes until we get more certainty in terms of the pace of recovery, but we continued to market across all of our products. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So you've been pleased with your account growth that you've generated over the past couple of quarters? That's what I'm hearing from you, Roger, is that right? Roger Hochschild : Yes. And in particular, I think we pulled out on the last goal, some of the costs per account that we were seeing in different channels as competitors pull back more. Betsy Graseck : Right. Okay, and then just separately on credit and the outlook for credit here. One of the questions is around stimulus. And if you don't get it, how much did that impact potential changes in the reserve. And then the other piece is on the mortgage forbearance, I think, I believe a majority of your customers have mortgages, and I'm wondering if you know through credit data checks, how many of those people are benefiting today from the mortgage forbearance and does that feed into your reserve analysis as well? Thanks. John Greene : Okay. Yes, so let's talk about the credit outlook and then handle the mortgage question on the back end. So in terms of the stimulus that we modeled, and it is one of many inputs, and we'll look at what happens in the fourth quarter and see how the roll rates are progressing in the portfolio through the quarter to get -- I'll say, a bottoms up view of actually, the impact there. So no specific information on that other than to say that underlying roll rates are far more positive than we thought they would be at this time. And if another round of stimulus doesn't come in, I think that's going to be tough for a number of people that have been impacted by the pandemic. And progressively it will start to impact the prime revolver base. And that's why we're conservative in terms of our reserve outlook here for the third quarter. But overall, again, we're pleased with our positioning. Now, in terms of the mortgage forbearance that we really don't have any data on that. What we are seeing is our home equity business continues to, it's open for business, we are underwriting standards that have tightened mildly through this and it's positioned pretty well and open for business. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks, John. Appreciate the color. John Greene : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meng Jiao of Deutsche Bank. Meng Jiao : Great. Good morning, thanks for taking my call. I wanted to take a look at a capital trend [indiscernible] invest and I know that you guys are in the midst of preparing the second stress of submission. But I was wondering, in terms of timing as to when you would get a better sense of the economy in order to possibly execute the buybacks one more time, is it in the back half of \u201821 into more into \u201822. Just any thoughts on when you guys feel you would have more clarity in terms of the economy in order to reinstate that buyback program? Thank you. John Greene : Great. Thanks for the question. So we're submitting our second round of stress tests in November. And including there are a number of judgments. I'm not going to get into the details would be premature on that. I would say, as you take a look at the capital trends for the business, they're super solid, our capital levels are higher than our targeted levels. And Roger was specific in terms of our cheering of capital allocation priorities. So there's no change to that. And we're going to work through kind of the details with the Fed, other regulators rating agency and then board. Sorry, I can't be more specific than that at this point. Roger Hochschild : Maria next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays. Mark DeVries : Yes, thanks. Just wanted to drill down a little bit further on the funding tailwinds. Could you give us a better sense of kind of what mix you're targeting between the DTC and affinity deposits and the broker? Is there a minimum level of broker that you want to maintain? And also kind of what's the funding difference between those two, just to give us a sense of how much your deposit funding on average could compress? John Greene : We want to keep the broker CD channel open. So we'll continue to attest that the relative change or difference between the direct to consumer and the broker deposits narrowed, narrowed significantly in the early stages of the pandemic, there was a substantial difference and the market took care of that and narrowed the gap. We do enjoyed slightly better pricing, if it's direct relationship versus through a broker so that -- what that will be our focus in terms of overall kind of mix of those, I would expect the broker channel to continue to contract a bit and the direct channels expand. Mark DeVries : Okay. And in the, with such low funding on the ABS, why not maintain that or expand that or they are like, liquidity concerns of having assets on income or that you're managing to or is there something else I'm not thinking about? John Greene : No, the cost there on the ABS, that's reflected is net of the hedge impacts. So fortunately, we hedge those and have a nice benefit coming through over the next couple of years. The actual outside contract rate on those ABS transactions quite a bit higher than that. So that was -- frankly that was the rates we are enjoying, there's just good work on the part of our Treasury team to hedge that. So we'll continue to ensure that the ABS channel is there and present and available to us. But it will certainly come down as maturity profile indicates. Mark DeVries : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. I just wanted to see if we could kind of square this circle around unemployment and where the unemployment rate is and the kind of liquidity that the consumer has been given up and so this day, and it sounds like we've -- both agree that, delinquencies, probably given this liquidity don't even start rising until the first of the year. And so when you think about your expectation for unemployment at 11 by yearend, and where we are, and the idea of a white collar rush of unemployment, that would be quite the rush of white collar unemployment versus the amount of people that are unemployed now versus a steady state. And so can you just talked about where the -- perhaps the job losses come from, and why it's a large magnitude of white collar versus still unemployed call it blue collar that we saw now, and how that's influencing your outlook for the 11% unemployment rate? Thanks. John Greene : Yes. Thanks, Dominick. So you touched on a lot there. And I would sum that up by saying there's a level of uncertainty around what actually will happen on unemployment. Now, the 11% does feel at this point, like, I'll call it a robust number. But what we're trying to get a good clarity on it as the service workers who initially were impacted by the pandemic containment activity went to the unemployment ranks, some of those have returned, we certainly have seen some indications across the economy that across the nation and frankly the world that it could be a tough winter here from a COVID standpoint. So that's going to further impact not only service industry, but the entire economy. And so as we sit here today, we're mindful of that as a risk and continue to kind of maintain the reserves where they are. So we don't expect there to be a rush of white collar unemployment. But what will be clear and we've seen some of this already, is businesses are sizing both their professional staff and the blue collar staff for the business at hand. And there's enough indications today that there could be some contraction and as such the unemployment numbers not exactly an easy number to predict but we feel like as an input to our model, it is appropriate at this point. Dominick Gabriele : Great, thank you. And if I could just have one follow-up here. I really appreciate that. And if you look at the other expenses in the expense base. It looks like the acceptance incentives came down as well as fraud even though we're kind of in this more online environment. Could you talk about what you're doing on the fraud side? And how that was -- and did you renegotiate in the global acceptance or is that a function of just volume and mix year-over-year versus the third quarter of \u201919 and how your expense base and other expense came down? Thanks so much. I really appreciate it. John Greene : Yes, so in terms of fraud, it doesn't reflect any, renegotiations with any of our merchant partners. Fraud is one of the areas where we're deploying advanced analytics, and next generation [technical difficulty]. Yes, and then I would just add, in terms of the other expense line, so. So we did see lower global acceptance, expense in the quarter. And that's a function of two things a little better on the economy and liability associated with some of our partners executing on kind of terms associated with previous incentive agreements. And then, frankly, just a level of uncertainty that's caused us to be cautious on I\u2019ll say signing up new rich incentive deals. Now we're still doing that, where it makes sense. But in terms of timing little bit cautious on that one. But we've seen, actually great effectiveness from our procurement team, driving year-over-year savings on the entire indirect cost base. And we're still, as we said, in the remark, investing in advanced analytics and some digital capabilities that driving up information processing, but my expectation is that we continue that we are and we will continue to get more efficient and overall information processing and technology spend. Dominick Gabriele : Great. Thanks and congrats on the quarter. Roger Hochschild : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research . Bill Carcache : Thank you. Quick follow up on the credit. There has been a lot of touch [indiscernible] around booming credit headwinds in the TDR portfolio, can you discuss how that [indiscernible]? John Greene : Yes, So thanks for the question, Bill. So you folks don't have the TDR disclosures but will come out or come out in the Q1 it's published. And what you'll see there is relative to the first quarter TDR volumes will be substantially down. But there's also the impact of the CARES Act with a regulatory exclusion for certain modifications that banks such as ours make. So we can put those two together and compare where we are in the third quarter versus where we were in the first quarter and called the first quarter of pre-pandemic relatively stable. So the point there is that there's not an abundance of activities or a massive jump in any sorts of activities there. That's impacting delinquencies. We do these programs to improve the cash flows of the company, and ensure that when there's a temporary issue with a customer, that they can manage through it and return to paying their bills. So from a credit standpoint, TDR standpoint, there's been good execution from our customer service teams. Bill Carcache : Thanks John. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Craig Streem for any additional or closing remarks. Craig Streem : Thank you, Maria. Thanks, everybody, for your interest. Enjoyed the conversation this morning and we are available for any follow-up questions that you may have. Thanks have a good day. Roger Hochschild : Thank you everyone. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

So, thank you, Craig. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I too want to add a farewell to Craig, and thank him for many years of service to Discover, dating all the way back to great support in our original spin-off from Morgan Stanley. Our strong fourth quarter results were the capstone to good performance in a very challenging year, proving the value and resilience of our digital banking business model. While the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic were expansive, our business stood up to these challenges and we are in $799 million after-tax for the fourth quarter and over $1.1 billion for the full-year. Our fourth quarter results underscore the capital generation of our model. While our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, our outstanding credit performance, combined with the actions we took to reduce our funding costs and control our expenses, enabled us to exit the year with a 30% ROE in the fourth quarter. Looking back on the full-year, our operating results highlight the strength of our business and the execution of our team. We proactively adapted to the many ways in which the pandemic has altered our operating environment, including changes in consumer spending patterns, repayment trends and borrowing habits. Discover has always provided best-in-class customer service and this did not change with the pandemic. While other issuers faced significant challenges with long hold times, there was no disruption to our outstanding service as we leveraged our digital capabilities and our 100% U.S.-based customer service. We kept average hold times under five minutes through the trough of the downturn and they quickly returned to normal levels of under one minute. John Greene : Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our fourth quarter results, starting on Slide 4. We earned $799 million in net income, or $2.59 per share. These results included several one-time expenses, totaling $137 million. Excluding these, EPS would have been $2.94. There were a number of factors, both positive and negative, that influenced our performance during the year. Importantly, our results for 2020 reflect proactive management of our funding and operating cost and our conservative approach to credit management. These factors helped offset the revenue impacts of elevated payment trends and lower sales volumes. However, we're seeing some positive signs with a return to sales growth in the quarter and continued expansion of our net interest margin. In the fourth quarter, net interest income was down 2%, reflecting a 5% decline in average receivables and lower loan yield. This was mostly offset by decreased funding costs driven by lower market rates and management of our deposit costs. Non-interest income was 14% lower, driven by higher rewards costs from strong engagement in the 5% category this quarter, a one-time write-off of certain real estate facilities and lower loan fee income also contributed to the year-over-year decrease. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks, and welcome, Eric. And if Craig is listening, it's been a pleasure working with you, too. I guess both, Roger and John, you talked about the idea of increasing marketing expenses into 2021. Could you just kind of flesh that out a little bit, talk a little \u2013 talk some about what it\u2019s \u2013 how much you'd like to grow accounts? What you're looking for? What signals would drive you to step on the gas a little harder or pull your foot off? And - because you've seen some of your competitors already start to spend the marketing. We don't know yet what that's generated. But maybe just talk about that a little bit. Roger Hochschild : Yes. Thanks, Moshe. So, you saw how we're thinking about the expense base for 2021. And then, I'll talk more specifically around marketing and new customer acquisition and growth. So, in terms of expenses, the business is committed to driving positive operating leverage over the mid-term. Now, opportunities in 2021 will dictate how much marketing dollars we ultimately end up spending for new customer acquisition. But in terms of the overall expense base, there will be incremental dollars for marketing, new customer acquisition and third-party recovery fees. As the courts reopen, we expect that those fees will increase consistent with the level of recoveries that we hope to achieve on bankrupt accounts. So, outside of those areas, we're targeting to keep expenses flat across the business. Now, certain accounts may go higher, certain may go lower, but the way you can think about it is growth initiatives, incremental spend, the balance of the income statement in terms of expenses will be flat to down. In terms of new account growth, what we're targeting is mid-single digits. Maybe if we're fortunate, we see some opportunities, upper single-digit account growth. And we hope that will translate into increased loan balances. We didn't give any specific guidance on loan balances because of the broad economy uncertainty there; and frankly, repayment trends have been pretty remarkable; and with it, potential new round of stimulus, that could further increase the prepayment trends. So, that's how we're thinking about growth and expenses. So, if there's a follow-up, we could take a quick follow-up. If not, we'll head on to the next question. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning, and my congratulations to Eric and Craig as well. Wanted to drill down on the credit quality and reserve assumptions. I understand sort of the reversion to the mean assumption given the underlying unemployment rate. However, I think Moody's has been improving their laws, their unemployment assumptions and that rate is declining sort of in the second-half of this year and into 2022. I'm just curious sort of how to put sort of your assumption that the loss rates will get to the reserve levels - those embedded in the reserve assumptions? And at what point do you reassess that? Is there something seeing inside your portfolio that's leading you to be more conservative? Thanks. John Greene : Okay. Thanks, Sanjay. So, I'll take this one as well. So, first, let me start off by saying we're very pleased with the portfolio's performance. So, the resiliency of our customer base has been remarkably strong. So, in terms of the modeled assumptions - so in my script, I talked about 8% unemployment at the end of 2021. I realize that's higher than where we are today from a reported number. And we also assumed GDP growth of 2.7%. Now, there are some folks forecasting an increase in GDP as well. So, as we thought about the reserves and the positioning of the balance sheet, there's a couple of things that we took into account. So first is the overall unemployment numbers. There's about 10.7 million people out of work. There's another 7.3 million people that aren't included in the unemployment number due to the fact that they haven't actively worked - looked for work in the past four weeks. So, to me, where we are from a life of loan loss reserving standpoint made perfect sense is conservative. We didn't feel like we had enough data points at this point, given the level of uncertainty to make a material change to the absolute level of reserves in the fourth quarter, given a life of loan reserving assumption. But I can say this, we're going to continue to look at our portfolio and the macro environment. We're going to look specifically at the trajectory of unemployment and the type of unemployment. So, we're seeing unemployment levels transition from service workers to white collar workers, who would more likely be representative of our customer base and the impact of stimulus. So today, we're well positioned, and we're going to continue to reassess it, first quarter, second quarter and into the second-half of next year and make appropriate adjustments. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Good morning, and congratulations, Eric and Craig, when I saw the - I'm hoping you're listening when I saw the voluntary early retirement, I hope you're a reasonable chunk of that number. Sorry. When we think about what you've said in terms of marketing and adding new accounts, that makes sense. There will presumably be a lag in loan growth as you add accounts. Historically, when you started to grow the portfolio, again, it's been led by wallet share gains and line limit increases. I'm curious when you think you might take that sort of brownout on line limit increases off? And how we should think also about rewards rate as you think about wallet share going forward? Roger Hochschild : Yes. So, I'll start it on the rewards rate. We tend to keep our rewards program very stable. It provides a lot of value. And so, while you've seen competitors make dramatic changes, we feel like our leadership position in cash rewards serves as well. So, we have in the past talked about a low single-digit increase in rewards rate due to structural changes. That will likely continue. But beyond that, we feel very good about where we're positioned and the competitiveness of our program. In terms of growth, it's always been a mix of new accounts and stimulating the existing portfolio. And so, it will remain that going forward. In terms of what would get us to loosen credit, I think many of the indicators that John talked about, right? So, getting better line of sight in the direction of white-collar employment is probably the most critical one. Rick Shane : Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays. Mark DeVries : I've got a follow-up to Sanjay's question. Clearly, the credit performance you've experienced so far is much better than you would have expected, just given all of the different macro assumptions. And so, my question is, what do you think you need to see in the data before you feel comfortable releasing reserves? John Greene : So first will be the performance of the portfolio. So, what's happening on specific roll rates, are they holding or are they deteriorating, consistent with what our modeled expectations are? Broad macro is going to be important. We also do know that if there's another round of stimulus, that will - which isn't baked into our reserve assumptions-- we do know that that will have an impact on a couple of factors - certainly, delinquency, repayment rate and ultimately charge-offs and required provisions. So, we'll keep an eye on that. Roger and I both talked about white collar employment levels and  will also be new jobless claims. So, putting those factors together with a strong overview on how the portfolio itself is performing, will be the key factors in determining what we do with reserves in 2021. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I had a couple of questions on the buybacks that you announced. I just wanted to understand if the buyback announced - like, what kind of CET1 you're thinking about when you are putting forth that buyback estimate? And then the second question that's related to that has to do with whether or not you've embedded reserve releases in your estimates for that? I mean, because of the four-quarter trailing, federal right now is - kind of circular reference there. So, wanted to understand how you're thinking about reserve releases and what your target CET1 is? John Greene : So, we continue to target 10.5%. In terms of how we thought about buybacks this year, the first piece I would say is, we wanted to ensure we're prudent with our capital, given the level of uncertainty. We do have the Fed constraints in terms of the four-quarter average of net income. And so, the first quarter and - well, the second quarter and first quarter of 2020 are impacting that calculation for the first quarter of '21. And then, we're also thinking about the CECL transition impact, which will be somewhere between 200 and 250 basis points as we think about CET1. So ultimately, we didn't want to be out at the far edge of the buyback envelope. We felt that $1.1 billion was an appropriate return of capital given a level of uncertainty. And that will take a dent out of, what I'll say is, the excess capital that we have right now. But our earnings power will be really important and that will give us an opportunity to reassess that in 2022 as well. Betsy Graseck : And then just separately, a follow-up question here on how you're thinking about the interchange rate? I mean, there's been a couple of - there's been some pressure on it recently after years of improving. I just wanted to understand, is the recent behavior more of a short-term phenomenon, less T&E? Or is there something else going on that we should be thinking about remodeling out that one? John Greene : Yes. Yes. So, the fourth quarter did come down a little bit. And we can largely point to mix as there was a strong pull away from the traditional online - or excuse me, the brick-and-mortar retailers to the online retailers, which certainly impacted it. But from our perspective, very well aligned with our 5% categories in the fourth quarter, which also drove incremental sales through our card. And ultimately, we think it will translate into other forms of revenue, specifically interest income as balances revolves. Betsy Graseck : So, this quarter was primarily the 5% cash back on the dot-coms that got obviously utilized very, very fully? John Greene : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : I'd like to echo my congratulations to Eric and Craig. I wanted to ask about the net interest margin. And I believe that 10.63% is the highest we've ever seen. Can you talk about whether the trough is behind us? How sustainable this level is and the extent to which you see room - margins to actually expand from here, given the room for deposit re-pricing and remixing towards lower cost deposits that you see from here? John Greene : Yes. Sure. Sure, Bill. So, from the trough, our second half NIM improved by nearly 80 basis points, incredible. So, obviously, we can't run that trajectory in perpetuity. So, a way to think about that is we ended the fourth quarter at the 10.63% that you just mentioned. My view is that we still have some opportunity on deposit pricing, especially, if there's another round of stimulus because that will put a lot of liquidity in the market and the competition for deposits will further abate. Now, how much, ultimately, room we have there, uncertain. Is it 10, 20 or more bps, to be determined? But my view, at least 10 bps, very conservative view. The maturity profile, we included that information in the deck to allow folks to be able to model through some improvements that we'll see there. And then - so frankly, some things that are pushing against net interest margin, especially in the second half of the year. If the credit losses do accelerate as we've indicated, that will put some dampening pressure on net interest margin. So, broadly speaking, we do see further room for expansion there. But I would jump from the fourth quarter number and do those steps I just mentioned to get to a reasonable way of thinking about the balance of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Rogers, if you could comment on what you think about the sort of long-term growth rate of the card business? If it's been impacted by - you have a lot of new areas like personal loans, you have buy-now pay-later. Is this just on the edges or do you think that this has some impact on the growth of the card industry? And could you be wrong on that, I guess? And could some of these new initiatives and FinTechs be more impactful? Roger Hochschild : I certainly could be wrong. So, I'll say that upfront. But we have not seen either of those have an impact on card loan growth. And you've seen that in the past, whether it's been a home equity loan boom, where a lot of people are doing cash out refis and using that to pay down debt. A lot of consumers seem to carry a level of credit card debt that they are comfortable with, certainly our base, and they tend to revert back to that amount. And so buy-now pay-later is the most recent trend that's out there. We're looking at that very carefully and have yet to be able to see an impact on our revolving loan balances. So, in my decades in this business, there's always something that's going to kill off credit cards. But so far, the growth trajectory of the industry remains solid. Now. it is a mature business. But we also - as we think about our growth, it's a combination of where the industry goes, but also our ability to take share from our competitors and capture a disproportionate of student, young adults who are coming into the industry. And so, we feel good about that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Sandler. Kevin Barker : Just wanted to follow-up on your - your guidance for losses to increase in the second half of 2021 and then likely remain elevated into 2022? I mean, are you envisioning, just given the current economic environment, that these are likely that we're going to have a plateau in 2022? Or is it going to be like a slow decline after we peak in the second half of 2021, just given what your view is on the economy and how things are playing out so far? John Greene : Yes. Okay. So, at this point, there's a bit of both art and science in terms of modeling kind of peak charge-offs. And what we've seen as we've gone through this pandemic is the peak has continued to push into future periods. And essentially, that's what we're seeing today. It's hard to believe, given the level of absolute unemployment and those folks that are outside of the employment ranks that aren't in the unemployment number, that there isn't going to be some material impact to credit and charge-offs at some point. The roll rates we're seeing right now in terms of - from aging buckets, one to the next, are incredibly strong, which is positive. So that means, by itself, there can't be an acceleration of charge-offs in - at least in the first four months of the year. Beyond that, you would expect, given the unemployment numbers that the roll rates will deteriorate, charge-offs will increase and continue to increase until there's absolute stability. So, we're seeing a peak in late 2021 and that could carry through into 2022 and then moderate as the towns go back and the economic - the broad macros improve. So, that's how we're thinking about it. I'm not sure if we've got it 100% right. If we don't, we're going to adjust accordingly. Kevin Barker : And then the follow-up on your comments about targeting to keep expenses flat across the business, is that relative to account growth? Or is that saying, we're - year-over-year absolute expenses will remain flat in 2021? John Greene : Yes. So, I want to be careful here. It wasn't absolute expenses. So, what I tried to do is distinguish between those expenses that will help us accelerate growth. And we expect those to increase. Those that aren't targeted to accelerate growth, we expect will remain flat to down. We expect - if you go through kind of line items of the expense base, salaries and wages, we've done some things this year to level that off, including the voluntary early retirement program. We have activated our procurement organization around third-party spend, and we've driven a lot of productivity through that. We have looked at every single line item on the expense base and we're making determinations on whether or not those expenses will help us drive long-term growth. If the answer is yes, maybe will increase. If the answer is no, they're going to be flat to down. Kevin Barker : So just to be clear, those expenses that are driving growth, should they be in line with account growth or be above or below, just dependent upon what you're seeing underlying the business? John Greene : So maybe one way of looking at that, for card, new accounts as an example, we expect our cost per account to be below what we saw in 2019. And that's with a tighter credit box and reflects the benefits we're seeing from some of our investments in advanced analytics as well as just the differentiation and appeal of our product. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair. Bob Napoli : I think I've said goodbye to Craig, like at least eight times over the last few decades. I don't think it's going to be the last one for some reason, but good luck. Roger, just - and so the world has come Discover's direction, if you would, I think the digital banking, branches banking structure that you have and then you have the unique asset of the network, obviously. But what are you working on? There's a lot of changes. While the markets come your direction, there's a lot of new businesses, direct banks, digital banks and development of companies like Venmo or private companies, Chime. Are there things that you're doing as you look at this to be on offense to expand the ecosystem of your products and services to try to get direct deposits to get more of, let's say, transaction banking accounts as well? What are you doing on the banking side? With all of the innovation in the market, where is Discover investing? Roger Hochschild : Yes. So, great question. If the world is coming your way, you've got to keep moving to stay ahead. And so, that is our focus. We've always stood for innovation back to our founding and inventing credit card rewards, but more recently with everything from the FICO score on statements, ability to freeze your account. And so, you can rest assure that that focus is still there on a pipeline of customer-driven innovation across all of our products. Specifically, in the deposit side, we think there's a lot of opportunity to get into transaction accounts. It will be a while before they become a material part of our funding base. But with our low-cost direct-to-consumer digital model as well as the advantage we have from being exempt from the Durbin interchange caps because we own our proprietary network, we're uniquely positioned for a bank over $10 billion. And so, it isn't maybe the primary focus right now, just given the excess level of fundings, but it is a critical initiative. And we feel good about our ability to compete both against traditional branch-based banks, but also against any of the new FinTech players. Bob Napoli : I'd love some color on what else you look - you're thinking about there. But as you look at the - your customers - the customers that you're adding, is there any change in the demographic mix of the new customers you're adding? There's a lot of times we are getting commentary or questions around, well, the millennials are not going to borrow on their credit cards the way others did. And there are other new forms of credit. Is Discover getting the same share of those younger customers? And are you keeping them? Do you feel there's anything to the thought that the millennials will be less likely to use credit cards? And, I mean, if so, are you looking at other products like buy-now pay-later? Roger Hochschild : So, in terms of millennials, based on the data we see, we're either the leading or one of the leading underwriters for college students. And the brand is incredibly strong. We have college students and young adults that appreciate sort of the leading digital functionality, as well as some of the innovations I talked about. And we're seeing very similar usage patterns as we saw in prior generations of customers. So, we're very excited about the growth there. And I think being in the student loan business and the second largest originator, helped to get our brand out there in front of the next-generation of consumers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht of Jefferies. John Hecht : Congratulations to Eric and Craig, as everybody else has said. And thank you guys for taking the questions. Maybe follow-on to Bob's question, but in a different way. I mean, you guys have tightened - over the past several quarters, you've had substantial net paydowns. I'm wondering, has your kind of back book composition changed in a good or bad way, or a positive or, I guess, negative way based on those patterns? Roger Hochschild : I would say nothing dramatic. And part of the advantage we had, we have been tightening for a number of years coming into this. We felt like we were late cycle and talked about that with you guys on the call. Clearly, we didn't expect it to end the way it did in early 2020. But that helped us from having to take some of the magnitude of changes, but I think some of our competitors did. So, we try and be consistent in how we run the business. And so, we've targeted the same prime consumer. And I think drove have not seen any dramatic shifts in terms of our composition, either with the new accounts we're booking or our existing portfolio. John Hecht : And the second question is private student lending. I think you guys referred to some market share gains in the recent periods. I know there's been some shifts in terms of other big banks that are exiting that segment. And then there's a new administration and then maybe some changing policy or some thoughts about potential changing policy. Maybe just some commentary given your momentum there and your outlook there given those factors? Roger Hochschild : Yes. So, I would say there's always a lot of discussion about what might happen in Washington about student loans. I would say, keep in mind, that over 90% of student loans are the federal student loan program. And so, that's where a lot of the attention is focused, very different animal in terms of the, quite frankly, lack of underwriting of that product and the losses they experienced compared to how we go to market. So, we feel really good about the business, clearly benefited from one of the larger players stepping back. But we believe we would have gained share even if they hadn't. And so, it reflects the fact that the brand is well-positioned. It resonates with consumers and we take the same approach in terms of customer experience and differentiation with the student loan product as we do on the card side. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : Maybe just staying with some of your non-card products. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about just the outlook in competitive intensity you are seeing for some of the - whether it's student loans, personal loans, even just on the network side of your business? I know there has been a focus to grow some of that too. So maybe just talk a little bit about what you're expecting from those businesses as we head into 2021? Thank you. Roger Hochschild : Sure. So, I'll start on the payment side. Always, very intense competition. In the payment side, we compete largely against two very large players. So, especially in debit, it's really head-to-head competition for merchant routing day in, day out. We don't expect that to change. But I feel good about the products we have, and we have a great team on it. In terms of other products, we talked about student loans. For personal loans, we have modestly widened credit on that. That was the product we tightened the most, just given the volatile in the downturn. We've loosened up, I would say, marginally, and feel good about what we're originating, positioned a little differently than most. We've always had a relatively narrow credit box for that, and those loans are, sort of, bigger ticket debt consolidation primarily. But I would say across all of our products, given the returns we get, these are all highly competitive, very challenging markets, and that sort of occurs day in, day out. Mihir Bhatia : And then just if I could quickly follow-up on some of your NIM comments. I know you mentioned the funding side of the balance sheet, optimizing that. Is there also an opportunity a little bit to optimize on the asset side of the balance sheet? Maybe you were running with a little bit of excess cash in 2020 given the downturn, or is that fairly well-optimized already? Thank you. Roger Hochschild : Yes, thanks. I'll jump in on that one. Yes, we do have some excess liquidity right now, and there is an opportunity to continue to move that forward. Now we're going to, I'll say, gauge that based on the level of asset growth because asset growth will consume that liquidity. And we've built a plan that assumes a level of growth. So. that's one point. The other piece is around deposit pricing and how we price the deposits coming in, turning into cash. And then in terms of balance sheet positioning, we are mildly asset-sensitive right now. So, in a rising rate environment, that will also be beneficial to net interest margin. So quite honestly, the liquidity, I think, will take care of itself over time. And the positioning of the balance sheet in terms of asset sensitivity, very, very positive to be accretive to net interest margin in a rising rate environment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meng Jiao of Deutsche Bank. Meng Jiao : Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get a sense on how you guys are thinking about deposit growth specifically, both direct-to-consumer and the broker deposits? I guess for DTC, it's now, I guess, 62% of total funding. I believe, previously you mentioned a longer-term target of 70% of the funding stack. Is that hard to still hold? Or do you expect DTC deposits to be even higher as a percentage of the funding stack going forward? John Greene : Yes. So, we're targeting 70%, 80%. So, 62%, you're correct on the number. So direct-to-consumer, our proposition has been very, very positive. We don't compete on the basis of price, which has been a good thing in terms of helping us to modulate some of the liquidity that we have. But also, the fact that deposits continue to grow shows that there is a level of loyalty and trust with the Discover brand. In terms of the broker CDs, we actually use that almost as a valve of sorts, right? So as our funding needs increase, we'll go more heavily into brokered CDs. As they decrease, we shrink it. So that's the way we've managed it traditionally. It's going to continue to be a liquidity channel for us, but a, what I'd say, less important channel over time in terms of total quantum of deposits. Meng Jiao : And then a second question. Just broad based, is there, I guess, anything structurally different in regards to releasing reserves under CECL than the prior method of looking at allowance reserves? John Greene : Not so much structurally. I mean, we've got a thorough process that considers all the elements of CECL under GAAP. The one thing I would say is the life of loan reserving does require more modeling and, frankly, a greater level of judgment given how far out into the horizon you're projecting losses. So, there's certainly a very strong governance element. There's a science to it, and then there is a level of professional judgment or art to it as well. So - yes, same could be said for incurred, but the horizon is much more difficult given timing of what we're trying to project. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Thanks so much for taking my questions. Can we just think about a potential windfall of excess capital from reserve releases? Excuse me. If that was to happen and the economic situation persisted the way it is today and you felt comfortable releasing the reserves, can you talk about the breakdown of how you would use that excess capital? I mean, when tax reform came, then there was a flood of capital. Companies started talking about we'll do half, about a third for growth, a third for capital return, a third for investment in technology, something like that. Can you talk about how you think about those pieces, should a flood of capital come your way? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Yes. I'll let John talk about capital return, but I would say, our business does not let itself to rapid deployment of capital, right? We market on a consistent basis, sort of flooding the market in a given quarter based on the amount of capital we have, I don't think makes sense from a long-term standpoint. The same holds true for technology, right? A lot of it is about spending smart, not just putting huge amounts of money. So, I have a real hard - if we do have a quarter with a big reserve release, there may be some things. If the margin in terms of investments in the business, that by and large it will fall to the bottom line. And I'll let John pick it up there. John Greene : Yes. And so, Dominick, I do appreciate your optimism regarding a flood of capital as a result of reserve releases and a powerful economy. Our priorities actually remain the same, so in terms of how we think about capital and allocating the dollars first to growth then to dividend and share repurchases, and then the last priority would be small M&A, I think, bolt-on capabilities or certain niche products that we think will drive long-term shareholder value. So, no change there. We go through an annual capital planning process here as most financial services institutions do. And we share the outlook with our Board and our priorities. And obviously, there's some regulatory constraints that we manage too as well. And then we'll make good long-term decisions to generate profitable growth and shareholder return. Dominick Gabriele : And then if we just think about the - if you look at the NIM in particular and the - this quarter, and the interest charge-off reduction in the quarter, that had a big impact on the yield. And so, could you just talk about the balance between, let's say, that interest and fee charge-off even just reverting to normalized levels, not including the spike of losses, let's say? But has that sort of just normalized over 2021 versus some of the benefits you have on the interest expense savings that you're doing, given all the - what you're doing there? Maybe if you balance those two against each other, could you still see kind of NIM expansion or levels in 2021 versus stable to improving versus 2020? Thanks. John Greene : Yes. We - Dominick, we do see opportunities for NIM expansion even in the face of increased interest charge-offs as the portfolio matures and contends with some of the economic stress. But the numbers in terms of quantum, I'm probably not going to get into that level of detail on the call here. But I will go back to what I said earlier in one of my questions in terms of how to think about it. So, we do see an opportunity for NIM expansion. And that - some of that will be tapered by credit and the impact of delinquencies. But even contemplating that, there will be a level of expansion. Eric Wasserstrom : All right. Well, thank you all very much for joining us. Anyone who has additional questions, please give us a ring. Emily and I will be here to answer questions. And have a great day. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, everybody. Operator : And thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2021 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you, Maria and good morning everyone. Welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin on slide two of our earnings presentation which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in today's earnings press release and presentation. Our call will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session.  Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks Eric and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. Last April, if you told me to the year into the pandemic we'd be reporting excellent credit performance, positive sales trends, and solid earnings growth, I wouldn't have believed it. While the pandemic is far from over and there may be twists and turns ahead, as a nation, we have made tremendous progress toward addressing the health crisis and reopening the economy. This quarter we earned $1.6 billion after-tax or $5.04 per share. I'm very pleased with these results, which reflect our robust business model; strong execution including a disciplined approach to managing credit; improving economic trends; and the impact of federal support for US consumers. Since the end of 2020, our view on economic conditions has improved. The rapid pace of the recovery has lessened our concern of job losses spreading to the white collar workforce and there has also been substantial support for the US consumer through stimulus in January and in March. Our current expectation is that credit losses in 2021 will be flat to down year-over-year. This improved economic view combined with lower loan balances and continued strong credit performance were the primary drivers of $879 million reserve release in the quarter. As discussed in previous quarters, the strong credit performance was accompanied by elevated payment rates that continue to put pressure on loan balances, which were down 7% year-over-year. Payment rates were over 350 basis points higher than last year and at their highest level since the year 2000. John Greene : Thank you, Roger. Happy Birthday, Wanji. And good morning everyone. I'll begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide 4. As Roger indicated, the results this period reflects many of the same dynamics we've seen over the past few quarters. The influence of stimulus resulted in elevated payment rates, which pressured loan growth. It also contributed to the strong asset quality and our significant reserve release in the quarter. Revenue net of interest expense decreased 3% from the prior year mainly from lower net interest income. This was driven by a 7% decline in average receivables and lower market rates partially offset by a reduction in funding costs as we continued to manage deposit pricing and optimized our funding mix. Non-interest income was 5% lower, primarily due to a $35 million net gain from the sale of an equity investment in the prior year. Consistent with our excellent credit quality, lower loan fee income reflects a decline in late fees, while net discount and interchange revenue was up 12% from the prior year reflecting the increased sales volume. The provision for credit losses was $2 billion lower than the prior year, mainly, due to an $879 million reserve release in the current quarter compared to a $1.1 billion reserve build in the prior year. Our improved economic outlook, lower loan balances and strong credit drove the release. Additionally, net charge-offs decreased 30% or $232 million in the prior year. Operating expenses decreased 7% year-over-year as we remain disciplined on expense management. Other than compensation, all other expenses were down from the prior year led by marketing, which decreased 33% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we intend to accelerate marketing investments over the remainder of the year. We'll go into details on our spending outlook in a few moments. Moving to loan growth on slide 5. Total loans were down 7% from the prior year driven by a 9% decrease in card receivables. The reduction in card receivables was driven by two primary factors; first, the payment rate remained elevated driven by the latest round of stimulus and improved household cash flows; second, promotional balances have continued digit decline reflecting the actions we took at the onset of the pandemic to tighten credit. Operator : Thank you.  We'll take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. I have a question on loan growth and marketing. Roger you talked about moving standards to pre-pandemic levels. Maybe you could just talk about the opportunities for growth relative to 2019 and how we should think about the marketing budget in relation to that? And then maybe you could just also tie in your confidence level on the loan growth given the stimulus? I mean, it seems like you guys have kept it flat in terms of loan growth expectations. So maybe just elaborate on that. Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Sure. Thanks for the question Sanjay. Maybe starting then with the stimulus. Clearly, one of the biggest differences versus 2019 is the payment rate. And that's partly driven by the cash payments to consumers the savings rate, but also the relief they get be it on their federal student loans or other payments they have to make. And so that's a real headwind against loan growth. And as I mentioned on the call, it's actually at the highest level since the year 2000. In terms of marketing, we feel very good about the cost per accounts about the projected returns we'll get on those have widened our credit box back to the pre-pandemic. Although as you recall we have been tightening for a couple of years and I would say continue to remain conservative in our overall credit approach. So, I really think it's a headwind from payment rates that has kept us from being even more enthusiastic about loan growth. Sanjay Sakhrani : And when we think about the marketing amount in relative to 2019, is there any context you could provide for that? Sorry for the follow-up. Roger Hochschild : Yes. I think part of it and John indicated this, I think, we're probably more comfortable giving you some view around where we expect total expenses to be. But also it will depend on what we see in the back half of the year. And so to the extent we see opportunities to deploy more capital against organic growth, we've been clear that's our top priority. And so that's why we'll -- we're continuously revisiting where and how much we should allocate to market. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning guys. Roger Hochschild : Good morning. Ryan Nash : So, Roger, John, on capital post this quarter's performance, you're at 15% CET1. You talked about reevaluating in the second half of the year. I guess given the outlook for credit potential for further reserve releases, I think it's fair to say you guys are going to be building in capital in the near term. So how should we think about the time frame of getting back to that 10.5% CET1 level? And how does that -- how does CECL day one factor into that? And I guess Roger as a follow-up to that just given all the capital sitting around does it at all change the way you think about acquisitions? And if so what would be the priority? Thanks. John Greene : Okay. Hey, Ryan, thanks for the question. I'll start it and then I'll turn it over to Roger for the second piece of the question. So, really, really strong performance. And the economy has strengthened beyond our expectations as we said in our prepared remarks. So we came into the year somewhat optimistic, but also cautious given the amount of uncertainty. What we're seeing is kind of a broad-based improvement in the economy, our credit fundamentals have been extremely strong. As a result, we made a decision to -- an appropriate decision to release about $900 million of reserve taking the \u2013 obviously, the CET1 ratio well above our internal target of 10.5%. We're looking to come back to that 10.5% point. We're not going to do it overnight. We know the CECL transition is somewhere between 200 basis points and 250 basis points on CET1, but that still leaves ample room for actions in terms of dividends, buybacks and targeted M&A, when and if appropriate. So specifics around timing getting back to 10.5%, I would broadly say medium term, but we're certainly committed to that target. And we'll do a number of efforts, including revisiting our buyback levels in the second half of this year to get there. And the follow-up might be, what do we expect the buyback levels to be incrementalized to? We're not going to give specifics, but I will give a little bit of history. If you go back to 2017 and 2018, our level of buybacks was about $2 billion. I'm not saying history is going to repeat, it will be subject to a bunch of conversations with our team internally and then obviously Board approval, but we'll continue to evaluate. So, Roger you want to? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. And on the M&A front, we try and be disciplined. And so I would say, would not let extra money burn a hole in our pocket. For those of us \u2013 for those of you who've been with us for longer, you'll recall we had significant excess capital post the financial crisis. We're limited by the payout ratios in the CCAR process. But as said, we will return it over time and stay disciplined. So as we think about M&A opportunities on the banking side, not much out there that fits with our digital model. You're seeing acquisitions that are branch mergers cost takeout which doesn't fit. And then on the payment side, while valuations have come in, they're still really high. And so we lean a bit more towards partnerships, potentially smaller minority investments. So again, I think you can expect no change to our disciplined approach around returning capital to our shareholders. Ryan Nash : Got it. And if I could squeeze in one other? So, on the slightly higher expenses, John, can you maybe just help us. What is the base for that? Is it GAAP or adjusted? And then second, Roger, there's numerous mentions of accelerating investments in data analytics and account growth. Can you maybe just give us a sense for what you would need to see for those \u2013 for you to bring those investments on in terms whether it's in the macro account acquisition? Or what would you expect to drive that? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Great. Real quick. First part of your question, the expense growth relative to cap last year. And then on the investment side, a lot of those are on capabilities, especially in the data and analytics area that just enhance all parts of our operations, whether it's the credit underwriting, the marketing, targeting, personalization, collections et cetera. And so they are given the return profile, part of it is just bandwidth and talent, I would say are more gating factors, but we're really excited about the benefits. And then in terms of putting more dollars to work on the marketing side, it will vary. Competitive activity has a bit of an impact on that, but we will just look at it on the new account side, what we're seeing across different channels and carefully at those marginal opportunities and the returns they generate. Ryan Nash : Thanks for all the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Roger Hochschild : Good morning. John Pancari : Given your commentary on expenses and your plan to invest selectively there on the marketing side, can you perhaps maybe help us think about the efficiency trend longer term? I know, you came in around 38.7% in terms of the ratio this quarter. But did you think about, what is a reasonable long-term expectation as we look out? Thanks. John Greene : Yes. Happy to cover that. So as we went through the pandemic, we really scrutinized the expense base, and there's been a long history of expense discipline in this company. And through the pandemic we found certain opportunities. So as we think about the balance of this year, next year, and going forward, we're going to continue to focus on controlling corporate costs, so that we can invest savings back into overall growth levers. And we've done that, and we're going to continue to do that. As we think about the efficiency ratio, we'll come in this year somewhere around where we finished last year, I think assuming revenue comes in with the modest growth we talked about in loans. And going forward, I would expect somewhere in the upper 30s would be a reasonable spot. That will indicate that we're driving efficiencies and still investing in the business. Any follow-up now? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Roger and John, there's a lot of debate taking place around what's going to happen with rates, whether we get more steepening at the long end and when we'll get lift off of the short end. Is Discover's ability to get to a mid-20% ROTC at all impacted by what happens with rates? Maybe another way to ask it is, can you talk about your confidence level in being able to get to a say mid-25% type ROTC even if the SERP remains in place? John Greene : Yes. Thanks, Bill. So, specific to rates, so if rates begin to increase, there's indications that a number of different things that are happening in the economy. So, you would expect inflation to be increasing a very, very low level of unemployment, probably near full employment for the economy and a robustness that might rival kind of the pre-pandemic levels on a sustained basis. And so, you have to believe that there are a lot of different things that are going to happen. And as I said, also, we'll take some actions to control inflation. Now, we've seen this over a number of years now that the Fed and overall interest rate environment has been on a sustained basis very, very low. As we look forward to 2021 and 2022, my expectation is rates will remain low, and we'll enjoy the benefits of an economy that's continuing to grow. Beyond that, it gets different -- more difficult to call. In terms of total return levels, it will depend on a number of factors. Rate is just one of those. Credit obviously would be an important item. But certainly, longer term, we think that we're in a position to drive high returns for our shareholders consistent with what we've done historically and our hope is when we come back to that 10.5% target that that will further enhance overall returns. Bill Carcache : Got it. Thank you. As a follow-up, you've discussed the opportunity in the student lending space among customers who may not have been thinking about refinancing their student debt to lower rate when their loans went to forbearance but as loan start to exit forbearance, is there going to be an opportunity for you guys to see an acceleration there? Roger Hochschild : Yes. So, we don't really participate in the student loan refi market. The pricing doesn't really meet our return hurdles. To the extent, there is more activity it can marginally impact the payment rate for student loans. But we feel really good about where we're positioned. And I think last year was very challenging. There's a lot of kids either deferred for a year or had reduced expenses, because they didn't have meals or housing, et cetera. So again, yes, we feel good about what this peak season should bring and our ability to continue gaining share. Bill Carcache : Thank you for taking my questions. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Roger Hochschild : Good morning. John Greene : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions. One you were talking earlier about widening standards in particular in card. And I just wanted to get a sense as to what you're expecting that will drive? Is that both an increase in accounts as well as higher lines extended to your existing accounts? And then, could you give us some color on how you expect to pull in the new clients given the fact that the consumer is in a fantastic spot? Are you pulling from other folks? Or do you feel like this is generating new demand from maybe a younger cohort that's not been borrowing yet? Some color on that would be helpful. Roger Hochschild : Sure. So in terms of the credit expansion, it's probably more heavily impacting new accounts, but also encompasses sort of our line increase and other criteria on the portfolio side as well. In terms of where I expect, I would say in all times, we give cards to consumers who are in good shape. But we do have particularly strong appeal to millennials and students. Our secured card is performing well in the marketplace. But then also the traditional prime revolver segment that Discover has always targeted. It's a very competitive business. It always has been. So, it's about differentiation. And there a superior customer experience a great rewards program focus on value those traditional things are what allow us to continue gaining share and booking new accounts. Betsy Graseck : It's interesting because your value prop very clear especially versus other card lenders with no fee etcetera. How do you think you're positioned against the Fintechs who also have a light or low or no fee proposition? Roger Hochschild : So there aren't that many of the Fintechs that are active yet in the card space. By and large they do loans of different types. And so, we've yet to see a significant, I would say Fintech player in the card space. And most of our competition tends to be the traditional leaders in the marketplace. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And if I could squeeze one in for John. You mentioned in answer to the prior question or two ago around the total expense outlook that you're thinking about for the full year 2021. And I think you mentioned that you're expecting 2021 to come in similar to the end of '20? And then from there as we look to '22 and beyond migrate back towards like the high 30s? Could you just give us some color as to the end of '20 expense ratio that you're thinking about? Because there's a couple of different ways you could slice based on one-timers. Is that a run rate that's north of 40% on the efficiency side? Maybe you could help us understand your sizing there? John Greene : Yes. So we used a GAAP basis on that. And so, the one-timers that were included in an underlying number that actually we didn't publish, but we called out the underlying numbers. It was about $200 million. So the operating efficiency is going to be dependent upon what we see in terms of loan growth payment rate and new account generation which as Roger said, and I'll echo the comments, we're very positive about how we're positioned to drive growth in the -- especially in the second half of the year as the payment rate abates a bit. So what you can expect here and I'm trying to provide as much detail as I can, is that outside of the marketing investments we talked about, some select investments in data and analytics, we're looking to keep all other costs flat. And we're going to manage that envelope as we see opportunities. But we'll be able to use that as a jumping off point to drive further improvements and efficiencies in '22 and beyond. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And so the $200 million is what we should x out to get to operating that's on the expense side? John Greene : Yes. Subject to growth and what we see as opportunities. So there's no absolutes. But \u2013 and as time goes on we'll have more clarity on the opportunity. Betsy Graseck : And then if I look pre-pandemic right... Roger Hochschild : So Betsy we do have some other questions to get to. Betsy Graseck : All right. Roger Hochschild : So we'll follow up later. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays. Mark DeVries : All right. I was hoping you could give us some color on where we should expect the reserve ratio to migrate to? Is it appropriate to think about it going back to kind of the CECL Day one level? And if so, at what pace could we get there? John Greene : Yes. Thank you. So, we took a meaningful chunk out of the reserve levels, this quarter. Honestly, the credit outlook and our models indicated that there was a range of different outcomes we could have made on that. And what we tried to do was, take a chunk out of the reserves that made sense given, the level of absolute uncertainty in the economy. As we look forward, the absolute reserve level or reserve rate will depend on what we see in the macros, how the portfolio is performing, and what we do in terms of account growth loan balance. But overall, as we think about where the provision levels could be, I would use the Day one CECL rate as a decent proxy. And subject to, how the portfolio is performing it could migrate up or down from there. What we did last year in the first quarter and the second quarter was react to an incredibly, dynamic and changing macro environment. And we prudently put up an incremental $2 billion. So, if the portfolio performs over time we could get back to that CECL Day one and perhaps, a little bit lower with excellent portfolio management. Now timing I'm not going to be specific on. Mark DeVries : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Well Fargo. John Greene : Good morning. Don Fandetti : Hi. Good morning. Roger, as we went through the pandemic, obviously there's more e-commerce spend. And is there anything that you've learned in terms of like, how you would position the company differently? It seems like big tech and technology are continuing to gain more touch points with customers. Is there anything strategically that you want to lean into or you've learned? Roger Hochschild : Great question, I think, it really accelerated a lot of trends that were existing prior to pandemic right? So consumers were already migrating more and more of their shopping online, but that moved even quicker. Their customer interactions were moving more towards digital that accelerated even further. So I think it had us recommitted to the path we were on and looking to accelerate some of the functionality. Certainly there were some specific things around the tap-and-go cards a lot of small dollar transactions migrating from cash to debit that benefited our PULSE volumes. But I would say in general, not so much new trends but, three, four, five year accelerations of trends that were already there and that we have been positioning the company to take advantage of. Don Fandetti : Got it. And on the potential investments or partnerships, would those be accretive? Or could they potentially be more technology investments? Roger Hochschild : Where we traditionally made them on the payment side is, with partners that either, add capabilities or to cement a relationship that will drive volume over our network. On the technology side, we found, plenty of great partner/vendors out there that you don't need -- people don't need money in the current environment. And so that's why we tend not to do investments in pure technology companies that aren't payments related. Don Fandetti : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Rick Shane : As you look forward to loan growth, how much opportunity is there to category-specific rebound, that's more indexed to borrow like travel for example? Roger Hochschild : Great question, I think that will be constructive. Some of the categories that were strongest through the downturn though had a pretty good revolve rate. So you think about home improvement that was really doing well. So a lot of it I think will be in the restaurant and travel segment, but I wouldn't necessarily expect a huge boost to revolve rate just given again some of the categories that were strong in the downturn. Rick Shane : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just really quickly I wanted to ask about competitive intensity. First, are you seeing any impact on cost of acquisition as customers have come back? I know that had trended very well last year and that's an area you'd be making investments in. And then maybe I'll just ask my -- the related question I had on that. Last year Discover's no annual fee, no cash back card was just really well-suited for the backdrop. As we reopen and maybe travel rewards become more relevant for consumers, are you seeing any impact on your usage? Any early indicators from consumers who would maybe move your card to top of wallet last year and what you're seeing? So just I guess competitive intensity more broadly? Thank you. Roger Hochschild : Yeah. So I'll start with the second one. We are not seeing an impact. And we think the lesson learned in the pandemic of the utility of cash awards hopefully will last. And we feel very good about even the newer redemption offers we've added. So the ability to redeem at point-of-sale with PayPal with Amazon, we've just announced the ability to redeem for carbon offsets, which we think will be popular with millennials. So no real change to that. In terms of competitive intensity we talked about it. They're just extraordinarily attractive cost per account last year as there was a significant pullback. I think we're now moving towards more normalized levels of competition. And my guess is we'll see that increase. But our job is to grow the business in face of the competition that's there. And so while I missed the CPAs from last year, we feel good about the returns we'll generate from our marketing even in a more intense environment. Mihir Bhatia : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht of Jefferies. John Hecht : Good morning guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. First question and Roger you addressed some of this with respect to the loan growth, maybe you talked about it being a mix of line utilization and new customers. I'm wondering is there one bigger contribution to that relative to the others? And what's the cadence, is this more of a second half factor, or is this going to be balanced over the course of the year? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. So on the cadence I do expect marketing expenses to ramp up over the course of the year. They weren't overly large Q1. But again with the wider credit box we'll get more leverage for the marketing spend, and so we would expect a ramp. But we'll look at that continuously and make adjustments as we see fit. In terms of the impact of the credit changes, it's probably more heavily weighted towards the new account side versus portfolio. But we always look for a blend of those two as we think about growth. John Hecht : Okay. And then\u2026 John Greene : And then -- sorry, go ahead John. Please go ahead. John Hecht : John just more of a concept question, we're a year into CECL now and obviously it's had a pretty big impact in how things have turned out from a GAAP perspective. How do you stack the major decision-making factors with respect to your ALL now? Is it the Moody's model? Is it unemployment? Is it just your internal opinion of your performance trends? How have things changed with respect to the way you look at that ALL level? John Greene : Yeah. Good question. So certainly evolving. So we use Moody's and also two other providers. So the broad macros are very important. The portfolio performance itself is also, obviously, a key input. And we have a team of technical modelers that have run various scenarios regression, sort of, scenarios to help make a determination on what overall life of loan losses could be, which is a key input. Because there's probably 12 to 15 different variables that go into that model that help do the projection. And then the other piece is your loan balance right? And what you have on the balance sheet as of the measurement date in order to set reserves. So, I would say, all of those factors are important. And then finally, one other one is the recovery rate, which actually also does go into the model, so four important factors. And we've taken a measured approach to ensure that our balance sheet is appropriately stated and we're on the conservative end of the judgment calls. John Hecht : Appreciate the context. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Meng Jiao of Deutsche Bank. Meng Jiao : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So, it looks like monthly sales for travel and restaurants and retail seems to have pretty much materially accelerated from February into March and particularly for restaurants. Have you guys seen that carrying over into April as well? Roger Hochschild : Yes. Yes. Yes, we have actually incredibly the sales performance the first three weeks of April versus 2019. Overall, were up about 17%. And it's three weeks into the month, so things can change. And then versus last year was certainly dented significantly by the pandemic. We're up 68% on sales, so, really strong there, and the mix between revolvers and transactors. Obviously transactors are up higher than revolvers, but revolvers are up, almost near double digits versus prior year, so all good. Meng Jiao : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Most of my questions actually have been already asked and answered. But maybe if you could just follow up on two quick points. One is, the payment rate, the stubbornly high payment rates and how that will likely decline. I mean, is there -- I guess maybe the question is, how much of that is a function of the actual stimulus dollars versus some of the ongoing impacts that you highlighted, whether it's enhanced unemployment benefits, student loan interest forbearance in terms of thinking about the pace of that decline? And then just very quickly, you talked about the CECL Day 1. Just conceptually, do you think that the life of loan has a higher or lower likelihood on January 1, 2022 of a near-term recession on January 1, 2020? Roger Hochschild : So, I'll cover the first part, and I'll let John forecast recessions. In terms of the elevated payment rate, it is a mix, but you are seeing a lot of it come from the governmental support. And so, we do expect it to come down over the course of the year, but remain elevated compared to historic levels. And this is because, households have a lot of savings withdrawn and there are just a lot of other forms of support. So, it's not -- it is a headwind against loan growth. It's really being driven by external factors. So, I would say we're not overly alarmed about it. And again, we would expect it to start drifting downward, as we get further past the really extraordinary levels of government stimulus. And I'll pass it to John for the questions on reserves. John Greene : Great. So, yes, I think what you're getting at is, what will be our macro assumptions at the end of this year forecasting out to 2022. So today, obviously, there's no perfect answer or perfect insight. I will say this, the pent-up demand for consumers, I believe, is fairly pronounced and will continue to drive spending activity through this year and well into next year. So that, to me, indicates that the macros should be positive through 2022. Beyond 2022, it's really difficult to call at this point. Moshe Orenbuch : Okay. Thank you. John Greene : You\u2019re welcome. Thanks. Thanks for the questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Sandler. Kevin Barker : Good morning. Could you give us a little bit more detail on some of the investment spend you're making on data analytics and driving account growth? And then also, is there any way to quantify how much incremental spend you're putting into that and returns that are being generated from that, whether it's additional growth or other trends that we can identify to quantify the growth or the investment returns that you're getting? John Greene : Yes. Great. So I'll hit the second part of that question first. So in terms of returns, we have a rigorous process where we take a look at incremental investments to ensure that they deliver strong cash-on-cash returns. And in terms of ROEs or return thresholds, I won't be specific, but very, very strong double digits on those, in line with what you can expect from the company on a normalized basis in terms of return on capital. In terms of what we're investing in data analytics specifically on -- I'm looking at the attrition from the portfolio, we feel like there's an opportunity to reduce attrition level through some early identification of customers who may not be maximizing the usage of the card. We have data analytics projects going on in collections. I mentioned in our prepared remarks in fraud and fraud analytics. So there's -- frankly there's almost insatiable demand for these sorts of programs. And what we are, we're being very, very selective in terms of making sure that we prioritize the highest returning ones in the current year. Kevin Barker : Okay. Thank you. John Greene : You\u2019re welcome. Roger Hochschild : And Maria, why don't we make this our last question please? Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Hey. Thank you so much for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the expenses. And sorry, I don't mean to beat a dead horse here. If you look at the GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020, they were almost about $1.3 billion. Are we expecting a quarter that could be that high? Or just because there was -- it seemed to be a little -- I got a little confused on one of the comments there. So is that reasonable to think that one of the quarters could be near that $1.3 billion level? John Greene : Yes. So I'm certainly not in the business of forecasting quarterly. I will tell you this from an expense standpoint. The marketing expense, the balance of the year, we expect will continue to grow into the kind of that envelope we talked about earlier. The quarter-over-quarter comparisons are frankly relatively challenging given what happened in 2020 in terms of our focused approach to look at every single dollar that potentially was going out the door on an expense item. So I would just focus on the broad numbers and the quarterly breakouts, I'll leave it to you to figure out what makes the most sense. We -- here we're looking at 2021 and 2022 and don't specifically try to manage to any particular quarterly number. Dominick Gabriele : Makes sense. And then, I guess, if you kind of look at what happened this quarter with the, kind of, benefits that you guys have with having not only a lending business, but one that also gains interchange that really helped offset some of the slowdown in loans, I guess. Do you expect that the -- we could see that Discover proprietary network being much higher as far as a growth basis going forward year-over-year versus your loan growth in 2021? Do you expect that divergence to be there for at least a few quarters? Thanks so much, guys. Really appreciate it. Roger Hochschild : Sure. So our total network spend is benefiting from growth in some of our third-party payments areas. If you include the debit side PULSE is growing very strongly and so that's helpful. But we also believe that having a proprietary network is an important differentiator and gives us a whole series of capabilities that helps us grow our banking business. So again total volume will depend somewhat on some of the partners and we are a little skewed towards debit for the third parties, but we're going to work for a continued robust volume growth. Dominick Gabriele : Okay. Thanks so much. Eric Wasserstrom : All right. Well -- sorry, sorry Maria, but thank you very much. If you have any follow-up questions feel free to reach out to join Emily and I, and thank you for joining us. Roger Hochschild : Thank you, folks. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2021 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you, Stephanie. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's call. I'll begin on slide two of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our second quarter earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, you will be permitted to ask one question, followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, Eric. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. We had a very good quarter that highlighted the strength of our digital business model and solid execution on our strategic priorities against the backdrop of continued economic improvement. This quarter was characterized by three important events. First, our card receivables grew sequentially in May and June, causing our period end receivables to be up quarter-over-quarter. This outcome, combined with the strength in consumer spending and our account acquisition, increased our confidence for moderate receivables growth this year and stronger growth in 2022. Second, we benefited from a gain in our Payment Services segment. This gain is an outgrowth of a long commercial relationship and underscores our payments ability to forge innovative and lasting partnerships. Lastly, we achieved a historic low in delinquencies, which resulted from consumer's strong liquidity position, our conservative stance on underwriting, and the proactive measures we took into the downturn to protect our credit quality. This outcome also supported our reserve release this quarter. Turning to the quarter's results. We earned $1.7 billion after tax or $5.55 per share. These results include a $729 million one-time gain. But even excluding this gain, our results were very strong at $3.73 per share. The drivers of the quarter's strong results reflect the combination of our solid execution and supportive macro conditions. John Greene : Thank you, Roger. And good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our summary financial results on slide four. As Roger noted, our results this quarter highlighted the strength of our digital model, solid execution on our priorities and continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment. Revenue, net of interest expense, increased 34% from the prior year. Excluding one-time items, revenue was up 9%. Net interest income was up 5% as we continue to benefit from lower funding costs and reduced interest charge-offs, reflecting strong credit performance. This was partially offset by a 4% decline in average receivables from the prior year levels. Excluding one-time items, non-interest income increased 29%, driven by the higher - by higher net debt count and interchange revenue due to strong sales volume. The provision for credit losses decreased $2 billion from the prior year, mainly due to a $321 million reserve release in the current quarter compared to a $1.3 billion reserve build in the prior year, an improvement in the economic and ongoing credit strength were the primary drivers of the release. Net charge-offs decreased 41% or $311 million from the prior year. Operator :  We'll take our first question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Roger Hochschild : Good Morning. John Pancari : Just wonder if you could - good morning. Just wonder if you can give a little more color on the payment rate expectation. I guess just what do you see and that gives you confidence in the moderate decline expected for the back half of this year? And if you could talk about the - you know, how you weigh the risks that the payment rate may not moderate from here? And then secondly, on that, are you seeing any differences in your FICO bands in terms of the payment rate behavior? Thanks. John Greene : Okay, great. Yeah. I'll take the call. I\u2019ll take the question, John. Thanks for that. So, payment rates are, frankly, at a record high. So if you looked at our trust data, you can see that in June they came in at about 29%, and that's - frankly, that's an all time high, at least as far as back as 2005. So what we're seeing when we look at the portfolio, now the portfolio, the trends are similar, but the overall payment rates a bit lower. What we're seeing is a couple of factors. So, one is a deceleration of the growth in payment rate. And second, we formed our expectation on the second half of the year based on all of the government programs that are out there and most - the most significant ones are expiring or have expired by the end of the third quarter. So we expect that, coupled with the strong economic activity and lower savings rate that we're observing, to result in a moderate decrease in the payment rate certainly in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, it could be flat to maybe even up a mild bit. But overall, our sense is that we've approached the peak of this and it's going to begin to tail out - tail off. Roger Hochschild : And in terms of the mix by FICO band, it's pretty broad. Certainly, the higher FICO SKU transactor. So you'll have a higher payment rate in some of the mid-FICOs you've seen revolvers turn transactor. But again, to John's point, we do expect it gradually to normalize. John Pancari : Okay. Great. Now that's helpful. And then separately, I appreciate the commentary around the loan growth expectation and you also expect some variability in your margin. So, could you - what does that imply for your net interest income expectations? If you could just elaborate a little bit on that in terms of the second half trajectory there and possibly going into 2022? John Greene : Yeah. So I'll touch upon it. So, you know, the net interest income will follow loan growth. But as you know, in the fourth quarter, the build on loan balance is skewed towards the last two months of the quarter. So net interest margin is what I'll say the trajectory is changing in a positive direction, given the sequential loan growth we saw from first quarter to second quarter. But again, it's going to be in the single digits, lower single digits, is general expectation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. I guess, my first question is, I know everyone is sort of waiting for the consumer to relever and there's positive signs, but maybe, Roger, you could just speak to the competitive environment? I mean, obviously, everyone's chasing growth or wanting to grow or maybe you could just speak to how it's out there? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. You know, as we've discussed in the past, the card business is always competitive. There was a nice little lull last year, that we were able to take advantage of and pick-up even more market share. But I think this is returning to more normal, maybe a little heightened, but more normal level of competition. You're seeing new products out there, increased marketing spend. But as I look at our value proposition, cost per accounts we're achieving and the returns, I feel very, very good about the marketing spend we're putting out there and what we're generating for it. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Great. My follow-up is on the Sezzle investment. Obviously, they're an up and coming buy now, pay later company. I'm just curious sort of, if you could speak to that specific investment, and how you see that unfolding for yourselves, both in terms of the investment itself, but also strategically inside of buy now, pay later? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Sure. So in terms of our buy now, pay later strategy, there are really two parts. The Sezzle investment is really being driven by the payment side. And that's similar to the investment we made in Marqeta a while back. Our set of network assets are very useful for many fin-techs, in terms of just an easier way to process payments and connect to merchants in a wide variety of forms. So I'd say that's the core of what we're doing with Sezzle. We also believe that potentially, overtime, there may be opportunities on the banking side. So in terms of our providing lending, not necessarily with Sezzle, but in the buy now, pay later space more broadly. And again, leveraging what we can do with unsecured lending and our direct merchant relationships. But I'd say, we haven't announced anything on the lending side of buy now, pay later at this time. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hi. Good morning, guys. Roger Hochschild : Good morning, Ryan. John Greene : Good morning. Ryan Nash : John or Roger, can you maybe just talk about the expectations for monetizing the Marqeta gain, how much do you expect to reinvest versus used for repurchases? Is it already factored into the buyback? Second, can you maybe just remind us what the lock-up is and your intention for the stake? And maybe just lastly, these increase in expenses that we have right now, marketing and non-marketing investments, how much of these are being driven by the Marqeta again? And should we expect these to be one-time in nature or should we expect them to stay in the run rate? Thanks. John Greene : Okay. All right, Ryan. Thanks. So the Marqeta gain was something that when we looked at the plan for the year, we didn't, frankly, envision that, that opportunity would turn out quite the way it did. So, certainly a nice outcome. You know, the spend that we're seeing isn't - is dictated based on that size of the Marqeta gain, but more about the broad economic opportunity that we're seeing right now to be able to drive positive growth. So frankly, we'll be spending at this level with or without the Marqueta gain. The kind of the lock-up, those points are disclosed in the S-1, so you can reference that and get real specificity on it. And then finally, in terms of the expenses and are they one-time in nature. So within the presentation itself, we highlighted kind of three items that were significant. So one was the bonus accrual unrelated to Marqeta again and more broadly a reflection of what's happening in the business and the outcomes we're seeing here in terms of generating positive returns. The other item there was the Diners intangible, which we took the opportunity based on what we see as a change in the cash flows in Diners to fully impair that and took a $92 million write-off. And then the third item was a $30 million software write-off. So all those are part of our normal, I'll say, hygiene factors. So the last two items were you know, what I would consider relatively one-off, and I wouldn't include those in the kind of operating cash flows going forward. But as you're trying to get a sense for overall spend in 2021, we talked about accelerating marketing expense. So the way I would think about marketing specifically is that we anticipate it to return to 2019 levels, which would indicate a material acceleration in the second half of the year, which, again, is tied to the fact that we're seeing good origination opportunities to drive growth and long-term profitability. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thanks for the color. And maybe as my follow-up, so you announced the new $2.4 billion buyback. But just given how high the levels of profitability are, you're still going to be well above the 10.5% level. So can you maybe just help us understand the strategy of getting the capital down over what time frame? Are you managing all into CECL day one? And then maybe attached to that, Roger, you talked about potential lending opportunities and buy now, pay later. We've seen others take, some go at it organically, some go via acquisition. What would you expect to be the strategy for Discover on a go-forward basis? Thanks. John Greene : All right. So I'll hit the capital point real quick. And then we'll flip it over to Roger to handle it back, second part of that question, the second part of that second question, I should say. So the capital plan was based on a couple of different factors. So one, we want to be prudent in our distributions of capital and make sure that we - organic - that we allocate our capital to organic growth opportunities and then buybacks and dividends and then acquisitions as they appear, so that hasn't changed whatsoever.  The planning in terms of capital overall is that we are committed to add 10.5%. As we look at the impacts of the CECL capital relief transition, that's about 200 basis points. And then in the first quarter of next year towards the end of this year, as we review the outlook for 2022 with our Board, we'll make recommendations with a couple of points in mind. The overall economic opportunity, the SEB and where we are with that, and there's plenty of room there. And then, finally, approaching the 10.5. Roger Hochschild : Yeah. And in terms of buy now, pay later, there are many sort of different things we could do. Clearly, going direct with the merchant relationships we have is one option we could work with  overtime. But, we don't have anything specific to share at this time. Operator : Your next question is from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Hi. Good morning  technology spend. I just want to get your thoughts on, where your head is right now, whether you're kind of making enough investments in AI and machine learning and staffing, different financial institutions or different points of the cycle? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. It is a major source of investment for us. And I would say that the scarcest asset there is talent, as opposed to technology dollars. And then part of it is just making sure you're investing to monetize the granularity you can pick up with enhanced data and analytics. So looking at the entire martech stack, your personalization abilities, what you can deliver through different channels. So it's a big focus. I think we're probably the only major bank where the Head of Data and Analytics is a direct report to the CEO. And so I think that reflects the importance we see on that. And I feel very good about our level of investment. Don Fandetti : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Bob Napoli : Thank you. I appreciate it. Good morning. Question, just a follow-up, I guess, on Roger, your investments in like Marqeta and Sezzle and just the thought. I mean, how are you working with Marqeta, how are these investments improving the product set, if you would, for Discover? And are there more of these types of investments or could they become acquisitions in the future? Roger Hochschild : Sure. So, all of these investments start with a commercial relationship. We are not venture capitalists, we have no desire to get into that business. But where we have a commercial relationship with a company where we think there's a lot of potential. And there is a way to invest and perhaps extract additional terms, maybe an exclusive arrangement or other commitment, those of the types of opportunities we pursue and they are largely on the payment side and we may even given some of the opportunities we're seeing, accelerate that, although, again, it's going to be relatively modest. In terms of acquisitions, given the valuations, I'm not sure I necessarily see doing acquisitions and this approach around partnership and investment seems to work well. But we will look at it. John and our payments team have a very strong business development effort, and we'll consider acquisitions where it's a capability that will help us monetize our payments assets. Bob Napoli : Great. Thank you. A follow-up on spend, your chart on page 16, the acceleration through the quarter relative to 2019, I mean, are you surprised by the level of spend that we're seeing? And how do you think about that relative to the long-term trend? I guess if you take this quarter, you maybe had a 10% compound growth from in 2019, but were you surprised by this and the acceleration through the quarter? And your thoughts on spend growth, as you lap - as you look at 2022 and onward? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. I mean, I think compound growth is a very challenging measure because it smooths an unbelievable cycle and I don't think any of us would have expected in 2019. So the year-over-year spend growth numbers are unsustainably high for the economy as a whole. The economy is growing above, I think, what economists would say its real level should be. And so you're seeing that pent-up demand from consumers. We expect it to normalize at a strong level, and we look to continue gaining market share given how we're positioned. But I don't think anyone is expecting retail sales to stay up 30% forever. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Yeah. Thanks. I had a question about the reserve levels. Could you give us some sense of what you're kind of contemplating both from a delinquency and charge-off perspective in those reserves? I mean, I think trends have obviously been very benign and yet you're still almost 200 basis points above kind of your CECL day one. What do you need to see to see those reserves come down more meaningfully? John Greene : Yeah. Mark, thanks for the question. So when we approach this quarter, certainly, the economic data was improving. The portfolio is performing extremely well. And the charge-off trajectory, you know, we revised our guidance and now believe it will be below the prior year. So all of those are very, very positive from a reserving standpoint. We did put a bit of caution in the kind of reserve numbers, as a result of the various government programs that are out there. So if you think about the eviction moratoriums, foreclosure moratoriums, various payment deferral programs and then the massive amount of government transfer payments that hit the economy, we felt like that those contributed to driving delinquencies and charge-offs below historical norms for our customer base. So under CECL, we reserve for life of loan. And accordingly, we were waiting for those programs to run their course and the cash flows to kind of feed through the economy and impact our customers. And then be able to make, you know, call it, a deeper change to the reserve levels. So as I said earlier, most of those programs ran their course in the third quarter. We obviously have the child care tax, there's a child tax credit. We don't expect that to be an impact. So in the fourth quarter, we should begin to see more data that would allow us to take a different look at reserves and then into 2022, certainly. Our expectation is that the credit environment is very positive from a growth standpoint and accordingly, we'll make reserves that kind of align with that. Mark DeVries : Okay, got it. And then, just one more question, do you have any other private investments that look like they could be in a large gain position just based on any kind of subsequent funding rounds and the valuations those are done at? John Greene : So, we have some investments, yes. We try to get in early and build out the commercial relationship, as Roger alluded to. And we're hopeful that the combination of working with quality companies and developing deeper commercial relationships will help those folks to be profitable and help us drive business in our payments area, while giving us an option value for that investment. So, one would hope that there's more. But at this point, it would be way premature to speculate. Operator : Your next question comes from Manu Srivareerat from UBS. Manu Srivareerat : Good morning, guys. Roger Hochschild : Good morning. John Greene : Good morning. Manu Srivareerat : Thanks for taking my question. I guess, you talked a lot about the benefits of having a differentiated product with flexible cash rewards. Now as things get back to normal and travel rewards become more relevant for consumers, are you seeing any impact to your utilization levels? Is there any indication that consumers might have a shifting preference for travel and my star rewards over cash rewards? John Greene : We've been successfully marketing cash award against travel rewards, and every other type of card out there for decades. So I wouldn't get too caught up in sort of the shift away from frequent flyer miles in 2020. I think it points to sort of the stability and structure of our program that we didn't have to make a series of changes. We focus on continuously enhancing it. A lot of people don't focus as much as we do on redemption. So, the ability to redeem at point-of-sale at, Amazon through our partner PayPal. So we are confident that we can compete with the travel rewards programs. A lot of the miles cards really target the super prime transactors, which isn't ours, it's much more a lend-focused model. We've got a very good miles card ourselves that we market. But again, I feel really good that our rewards can compete against anyone out there. Manu Srivareerat : Okay. Thank you for that. And just as a follow-up, how should we think about the rewards rate, as you think about growing loan balances, for example? Is there anything to that? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. So I'll cover this one. So the rewards rate over time has been relatively stable. It's increased somewhere between 1 and 3 bps annually. We expect that the 5% programs and the reward structure will continue that trend, while helping us to sustain a strong level of customer loyalty. So we look at that increase, as a natural evolution of a good investment in our customer relationships. Manu Srivareerat : Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks for the color. Have a good day, guys. Roger Hochschild : Thank you. John Greene : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Mark really covered what I wanted to talk about in terms of reserves. But I'd just like to follow-up on that slightly. The observation was made that your reserve rate is about two points higher than it would have been on day one. Day one was essentially an ideal economic environment, low unemployment, steady growth, et cetera. Should we look at day one as a destination for where the reserve rate will go or more as a channel marker in terms of sort of an ideal operating environment? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. Good question. So the short answer is that it depends on the economic outlook and the portfolio performance. I would say, to give a kind of view on the marker, when we look at the reserve rate back in, call it, January 1, we're at just over 6%, we're at just over 8% now. That difference is about $1.7 billion of reserves on the current loan book.  So if we have a level of confidence in the economic environment, portfolio continues to be positive. And the work we've done on analytics drive, I'll say, positive credit performance. There is an expectation in a benign environment that we should march back that way. So I think it's premature to say we'll get there. There is a lot of factors that could change. But I look at that day one as a marker for a solid credit environment and a relatively strong performing credit book. Rick Shane : Great. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Thanks. Good morning, Roger and John. Roger Hochschild : Good morning. John Greene : Hey. Good morning, Bill. Bill Carcache : Can you guys help square the continued strength in customer acquisition that you expect on one hand with payment rates remaining low for an extended period on the other? You mentioned, I think, John, the end of the pandemic-related federal forbearance programs is somewhere is a catalyst for payment rate normalization. But why do you think payment rates will remain elevated after that support has ended? John. Greene: Yeah. I'll start it and then maybe Roger will add a couple of points on the back end. So certainly, if you look at, frankly, the projected GDP, that's above normal levels for a strong US economy, and that's as a result of, frankly, all of the activity and the transfer payments I talked about earlier. I think there is a natural, I'll say, transition from where we are today to something that approaches historical norms. The savings rate is still high, but it's falling. And so that's positive. And in terms of overall sales activity versus payment rates, we do expect the sales levels at some point to moderate, partly because of year-over-year comps and partly because of what's happening on economic activity. But with that said, I would expect that payment rate, there's a bit of an inverse relationship. And what we're seeing from a growth standpoint is the sales activity, the new account acquisition, the payment rate is a bit of a headwind, and then, that revolve transactor rate aligning to payment rate. But despite all that, we've been able to grow, from first quarter to second quarter. So, as that payment rate moderates a bit, sales activity, I think, will be a lag to that. And we'll be well-positioned to grow in the fourth quarter and beyond. Bill Carcache : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And if I may follow up on that. As we look out to next year, would you expect that process of - that you've described in the sort of this payment rate and revolve rate normalization? Should that provide an incremental tailwind to loan growth, such that we could actually see your loan growth start to outpace your spending growth? John Greene : 2022 is still about six months away, five to six months away. So we're working on it right now. I'll tell you this, I'm positive in terms of how the business is positioned. And what we can expect from a topline standpoint, as well as credit and expense. So those factors, I feel very good about, but to get into a level of specificity at this point, it's probably a bit early. Operator : Your next question is from Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank. Meng Jiao : Hi, guys. Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to - students loans. As we head into the third quarter, it's probably the first time over a year that probably many college students are on campus. I guess are you doing anything differently in terms of how you're approaching the start of this particular school year? And sort of is it fair to say that marketing to students is going to be a large piece of that accelerating marketing spend that you guys have commented on? Roger Hochschild : The third quarter is peak season for student loans, but all the marketing is done before they get to campus. Volume was suppressed last year, because for many of our customers, we encourage them to take federal student loans. And then, use our private student loans to top off. And if their expenses were lower, because they're paying tuition, but not paying housing and food, et cetera, that had an impact on our volume. On the other hand, we did benefit last year from a major competitor pulling out of the marketplace. So I would say we're optimistic with kids going back on campus, but this will be a strong year for originations. And that we will continue to gain market share in the student loan product. Meng Jiao : Got you, great. And then secondly, I think you mentioned growing confidence in consumer home  Quarter-to-date, have you seen, I guess, a continued acceleration in that spending? I know we're roughly 22 days into the third quarter. And then secondly, Roger, I think you  are unsustainably high. I'm just curious if you had any further color as to when you expect that to sort of normalize? Thank you. John Greene : I'll start with that one. I think it will take a while to normalize. There is a good amount of pent-up demand, but also pent-up liquidity in the form of the savings that have built-up, as well as just the open to buy that people have on their cards from sort of month-after-month of pretty high payment rate. So I think that will provide some support. On the other hand, a huge amount of uncertainty in terms of what will happen with the Delta variant and other factors that can drive the economy. So we feel like, we're well positioned, but unclear what the back half of the year will bring. In terms of what we're seeing so far this month, I would say travel continues to be constructive, but overall, not necessarily accelerating, but spend levels staying very strong. Operator : Your next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. I guess getting back to the BNPL. Is your primary kind of revenue or growth kind of opportunity in the Sezzle on the lending side, is that the way we should think about it? Roger Hochschild : No. You should think about it on the Payment segment. So transaction processing revenue and sort of - with payment processing and sort of connectivity to the merchant side. And so that's sort of our first entry into buy now, pay later has been more on the Payment services segment, as opposed to our direct banking side. Moshe Orenbuch : Got you. One of the things that you've talked about in the past about buy now, pay later is the question of whether it kind of encourages or discourages younger consumers from taking out a credit card. And I think you had said, either on the last call or one of the presentations, that because of lending brand of Discover that you haven't kind of seen that impact. Could you just talk a little bit about how you think about the value, I guess, of the student lending in terms of kind of - and in terms of that marketing of the Discover brand? Roger Hochschild : Sure. We are very successful in the student card business. I think the student loans help, but also it has to do with the product, the value proposition and some very good marketing. And we see actually great credit performance from students, because contrary to popular belief, a lot of them are very responsible in how they handle their cards. With student loans, I'd start by saying, we think it's a great business, it's profitable. I would say it is operationally complex, but it also gets our brand out there with parents, as well as students when they're making a series of financial decisions. So you know, there are not that many banks that are in it at scale, not that many too that have sort of the product set that we have to be able to leverage those relationships. So it's a key part of our banking strategy. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. And just a quick follow-up on the reserving point. I guess, I was sort of wondering if your reserves on day one included an expectation of a potential of a recession somewhere in the life of those receivables. Just as you think about it as we kind of enter 2022, would that be a lower probability just given the experience that we've had or is that - think about it? John Greene : Yeah. So when we did day one, we looked at through the cycle of use. So what essentially that means is, we didn't look at the trough of delinquencies and charge-offs, nor did we look at peak. So to extremely oversimplify it, a bit of averaging with the help of a bunch of data scientists. So that day one is a, call it, a normalized view of the credit environment. Operator : Your next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions and good morning. Roger Hochschild : Good morning. Mihir Bhatia : I wanted to ask - yeah, I wanted to go back to your comment on competitive intensity, and it certainly does feel like cash back cards has increased. I think you alluded to intensity being a little higher than maybe the average historically. So maybe just talk a little bit more about the dimensions of this competition? Is it spilling over beyond just higher direct rewards like the 1.5% or 2% rewards  are you seeing any irrational signing bonuses and productory offers, spend $5,000 in three months, get $100, or anything irrational? Are you seeing anything on the balance transfer side? How is Discover responding to this increased competition? And is there - is the increase in marketing spends in part because of this elevated competition? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. So I'll start with the back half. The increase in marketing spend is driven really by the opportunity we see. So it is not by the competition. I do expect the cost per account to be modestly higher than, say, 2019 levels. 2020 was extraordinarily good. But part of that has to do with just booking more new accounts. And the marginal ones tend to be more expensive. I do think some of the rewards products out there will not be sustainable long-term. You've seen 2% cash back offers come and go for a very long time, especially when we eventually get to a higher rate environment. So far, balance transfer demand is still a bit suppressed. So we're not seeing the overly long 24 month 0% offers. You are starting to see some of those high spend 4,000 and get 400 type offers from some of the issuers that I think are most aggressive around growth. But again, nothing that I would say we haven't seen before. It tends to be different people at different times. But this is part of the card business and what we're used to competing against. Mihir Bhatia : Great. Thank you. And then, just - I just wanted to ask about your debit product. Any update on that? Has that - where are we, has that being rolled out, is there thoughts to expand the marketing or push behind it? Just any update on the debit product. Thank you. Roger Hochschild : Yeah. So given the excess deposits we had, we really pulled back on the vast majority of our deposit marketing, including that product. But we're very excited about the differentiation having cash back. So we think we're well positioned against the challenger banks, as well as traditional banks. And so we'll continue to ramp it up, probably more so towards the back half of the year and as we get into 2022. Mihir Bhatia : Okay. Thank you. Eric Wasserstrom : Stephanie, I think we have time for one last question. Operator : Your last question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Thanks. So I just had two. One is on the marketing. I just wanted to make sure I understood what you meant by marketing expense anticipated return to 2019 levels. Are you saying that, the back half of '21 will be at a run rate similar to full year 2019? Or the back half of '21 is going to be similar to the quarterly run rate of 2019? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. So I think total year '21 to be similar to total year of '19. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Roger Hochschild : That would require you know,  in the back half. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. And then, just separately on credit. I know a huge debate in the group here is around payment rates and how we're anticipating them to traject  over the course of the next year or so. One other question specifically for you is that, if I recall correctly, you've got a homeowner SKU to your box and home prices have clearly accelerated significantly, 15%, 20%, depending on the location. So I know you look at your customers routinely and check how they're doing financially. Are you seeing any signs of your customer base having refi and materially dropped their monthly mortgage payment requirements, which would potentially keep your payment rates elevated for longer or how you think about this refi cycle and what it means for your customers and their financial health and how that translates to payment rate for you? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Yeah. We have - and this cuts across past cycles, we haven't seen a link between sort of a refi boom and card payment rates. And so I don't have any expectation that would happen this time. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Operator : I would now like to turn it back over to Eric Wasserstrom for closing remarks. Eric Wasserstrom : Well, thank you very much for joining us. If you have any additional questions, the IR team is available all day and, of course, whenever. So thanks again. And have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2021 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. . . Thank you and I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you, Ashley, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's call. I'll begin on Slide two of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.  Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our Third Quarter earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, we request that you ask one question, followed by one follow-up question. After follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thank you, Eric. And thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. We had another period of strong financial results in the third quarter with earnings of $1.1 billion after-tax or $3.54 per share. In many respects, these results reflected the unique benefits of our integrated Digital Banking and Payments model, which continues to be a source of significant competitive advantage by supporting our value proposition to consumers and merchants, and differentiating our brand. These advantages enabled our continued investment in account acquisition, technology, and analytics while generating substantial capital. In an environment characterized by new entrants and intensifying competition, we believe the strength of our model position us to accelerate our growth. Underlying our results this quarter were 3 important advancements. The first was our return to year-over-year receivables growth, which is driven by our investment in acquisition and brand marketing, and continued strong sales trends. Total sales were up 27% over 2019 levels with strong momentum across all categories.  Even travel sales increased, and while they dropped a bit in August due to concerns related to the Delta variant, travel has steadily improved since that. We also continued to see attractive opportunities for account acquisition and increased our marketing investments to take advantage of this. While the competitive environment has intensified, new account so are now up 17% over 2019, reflecting the strength of our value proposition. This value proposition remains anchored in our industry-leading onshore customer service model, no annual fees, and useful and transparent rewards.  While some of our peers had to reinvigorate their rewards offerings at substantial cost, our rewards costs were up only 6 basis points year-over-year, and nearly all of this increase was driven by higher consumer spending, as evidenced in our strong discount revenue. Given these dynamics, we will continue investing in new accounts as long as the environment supports profitable opportunities and our robust account growth and our expectations for modest improvement in payment rates supports so our view of stronger receivables growth in 2022. The second key trend was credit, which remained exceptionally strong. Our disciplined approach to credit management and favorable economic trends contributed to a record low net charge-off rate and continued low delinquencies. The delinquency outlook affirmed our expectations that losses will be below last year's levels for the full year and supported additional reserve releases during the quarter. And the third is the continued expansion of our payments business.  Both saw a meaningful increase in debit volume with 9% growth year-over-year, and a 26% increase over the third quarter of 2019, demonstrating both the impact of the recovery and an increase in debit use through the pandemic. Our Diners business has also started to see some improvement from the global recovery with volume up 12% from the prior year. As the global economy recovers, we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our international reach. In summary, our value proposition continues to be attractive and our Integrated Digital Banking and Payments model supports profitable long-term customer relationships and is highly capital-generated. I continue to feel very good about our prospects for future growth. I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail. John Greene : Thank you, Roger. And good morning, everyone. Once again, our results this quarter reflect strong execution and that continued economic recovery. Looking at our financial summary results on Page 4, there are 3 key things I want to call out. First, our total revenue net of interest expense is up 8% from their prior year, excluding a $167 million unrealized loss due to market adjustments on our equity investments, including this, revenue is up 2% for the quarter. Second, is a continuation of very strong credit performance. Net charge-offs were down 343 million from the prior year, which supported a $165 million reserve release this quarter. Lastly, we continue investing for growth with increased marketing spend, higher operating expenses in other area were largely related to the economic recovery.  I'll go over the details of our quarterly results in our full year outlook on the following slides. Looking at loan growth on Slide 5. We saw the return to growth this quarter with ending loans up 1% over the prior year, and up 2%, sequentially. Card loans were the primary driver and we're also up 1% year-over-year and 2% over the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in card receivables was driven by strong sales volume and robust account acquisition. Sales growth continued to accelerate and was up 27% over the third quarter of 2019. Year-to-date new accounts were up 27% from their prior year and up 17% over 2019 levels. The contribution from these factors was mostly offset by the ongoing high-payment rates as household savings and cash flows remain elevated. The payment rate was approximately 500 basis points over pre -pandemic levels. We anticipate that the payment rate will moderate a bit as most federal COVID support programs have ended and consumer savings rates have started to decrease. That said, we expect payment rates to remain above historical levels through 2022. Looking at our other lending products. Organic student loans increased 4% from the prior year with originations up 7% as most schools have returned to the normal in-person learning model.  Personal loans decreased 4% driven by high payment rates. Our underwriting criteria have returned to pre -pandemic level, and we expect a return to growth in this product in future periods. Moving to slide 6. Net interest margin was 10.8% up 61 basis points from the prior year, and 12 basis points from the prior quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, the increase in net interest margin was primarily driven by lower interest charge-offs and lower funding costs. This was partially offset by higher mix of promotional rate balances. Card loan yield was up one basis point sequentially as lower interest charge-offs were offset by the increased promotional balance mix.  Yields on personal loans declined 15 basis points sequentially, due to lower pricing. The margin continued to benefit from lower funding cost primarily driven by maturities of higher rate  and an increased mix of lower rate savings and money market balances. Average consumer deposits were flat year-over-year, and declined 1% from the prior quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decline was largely driven by consumer CDs. We also saw a slight decline in savings and money market deposits as consumers continue to spend excess levels of liquidity. We also continue to optimize our funding stack.  Late in September, we executed our first ABS issuance since October 2019, consisting of a $1.2 billion security with a 3-year fixed rate coupon up 58 basis points, and a 5-year $600 million security with a fixed coupon of a 103 basis points. These were our lowest ABS coupons ever and show good execution and timing by our treasury team. Looking at revenue on Slide 7, total non-interest income increased 90 million or 20% over the prior year, excluding the unrealized loss on equity investments.  Net discount and interchange revenue was up 61 million or 26%, driven by strong sales volume. This was partially offset by increased rewards costs due to high sales in the 5% category, which was restaurants and PayPal, both this year and last. We continue to benefit from strong sales through our partnership with PayPal, while restaurant sales were up 62% year-over-year as dining activity recovered. Loans fee income was up 21 million or 21% primarily driven by lower late fee charge-offs and higher non-sufficient funds and cash advance fees. Looking at Slide 8, total operating expenses were up $185 million or 18% from the prior year. The details reflect our focus on investing for future growth while managing our operating costs.  Employee compensation increased 12 million driven by a higher bonus accrual in the current year. Excluding bonuses, employee compensation was down 3% from their prior year from lower headcount. Marketing expense increased 70 million, supporting another quarter of strong new account growth. Other expense included a $50 million legal accrual. Professional fees were up $47 million primarily due to higher recovery fees  reopening combined with strong credit and economic conditions have driven an increase in recoveries and their associated fees, year-to-date recoveries were up 20% compared to the prior year. The benefits of these costs is reflected in lower credit losses. Moving to slide 9. The trend of sustained strong credit performance, continued. Total net charge-offs were a record low at 1.46% down a 154 basis points year-over-year and 66 basis points sequentially. Total net charge-off dollars decreased 343 million from their prior year and were down 131 million quarter-over-quarter. Credit performance was strong across all products as evidenced by the net charge-off rates on card, private student loans, and personal loans. Moving to the allowance for credit losses on slide 10. This quarter, we released a $165 million from the reserves and our reserve rate drop 35 basis points to 7.7%.  The reserve release reflects continued strong credit performance and a largely stable macroeconomic outlook. The impact of these was partially offset by 2% increase in loans from the prior quarter. Our economic dysfunctions include an unemployment rate of approximately 5.5% by year-end, and GDP growth of just over 6%. These assumptions were slightly less positive than those used in the Second Quarter, but still reflect a strong at economic outlook. Looking at Slide 11, our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 15.5%, well above our 10.5% target. We repurchased $815 million of common stock and, as we had previously announced, increased our dividend payable by 14% to $0.50 per share.  These actions reflect our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. On funding, we continue to make progress towards our goal of having deposits be 70% to 80% of our funding mix. Deposits now make up 68% of total funding, up from 62 in the prior year. Wrapping up on slide 12. Our outlook for 2021 has not changed and reflects continued strong execution against our financial and strategic objectives. In summary, we remain well-positioned for profitable growth from improving loan trends.  Credit performance trends remained favorable, reflecting positive macroeconomic conditions and our approach to underwriting and credit management. Investments for growth have supported the significant increase in new accounts while we've contained operating expenses. Lastly, our Integrated Digital Banking and Payments model is highly capital-generative, allowing us to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders. We look forward to providing our outlook for 2022 on our conference call in January. With that, I will turn the call back to our Operator, Ashley, to open the line for Q&A. Operator :  We do remind you that you please pick up your handset for optimal sound quality. And we'll take our first question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI, please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. Wanted to see if you could give us a little more color on your payment rate expectations. I know you expect them to remain elevated through 2022, but just wanted to see if you're starting to see signs of accounts that typically revolve. I'm starting to see some decline to payment rates there. And then I guess how material of an inflection you think we can see through 2022 or do you think that's not likely until '23? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Great. Alright. Thanks for the question. The payment rate has been persistently high And what we did see in the month of September was that ticked down mildly. It did increase from July to August, which was frankly a bit of a surprise. But as I look -- as I looked at the data, we're seeing here in terms of revolve, and then the forecasted trends, my expectation is that in the fourth quarter, it will continue to step down.  Some of that has to do with governments support programs ending in September and some of it has to do with the holiday season. And then as we look on the holiday season into 2022, I do expect that it will continue to step towards a normalized rate. But, frankly, I don't think that'll happen until 2023. How do we think about the implications from that? Certainly, the payment rate is a bit of a headwind to growth. But what we've seen is really strong account acquisition and strong sales growth, John Greene : which to date has helped offset some of that payment rate impact. So overall, we feel very, very comfortable that 20 -- the balance of '21 and then 22, we'll have a bit of tailwind related to both payment rates declining and then strong, strong execution from the new accounts and sales growth. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. Thanks, John. And then on the account acquisition front, I know you indicated that you expect marketing costs to be higher in the second half. So if you can give us a little bit more detail around your expectation there and how they could trend for the fourth quarter. And then does that imply that you could see some continued upside pressure into 2022 on marketing as you drive account acquisition in light of pressured payment rates? John Greene : Yes. So from a marketing standpoint, we spend the money as we see opportunity to drive profitable new accounts. And, frankly, we've had a great quarter and a great year with that. The third quarter spend actually came in mildly lower than what we originally anticipated, and the guidance I had provided on the last call was that we would approximate the 2019 levels of total marketing expense. I think it'll be a little bit under that, largely not because of opportunities, but basically kind of some process oriented stuff in terms of account targeting. So we feel like the money we'll spend in the fourth quarter will certainly generate positive new account growth. It will pick up from third quarter certainly, and provide us a good trajectory for 2022. John Pancari : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. John Greene : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ryan Nash : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Roger Hochschild : Morning. Ryan Nash : Roger, you talked about intense competition and the impact of new entrants. Can you maybe just expand on those points about what you're seeing competitively, how you think Discover is positioned for it, and where do you believe this is having the biggest impact on your business and how are you responding to it? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Sure, thanks for the question. I think my actual comment was good growth in the face of intense competition, and I think that really sums it up well. The competition in the card business is always intense. We were lucky enough to have a lapse in 2020. And so some show of extraordinarily good cost per account. But it's what we're used to facing. It'll vary based on which issuers are refreshing their cards or have more of a desire than growth for growth than others.  But I think our focus on a clear, differentiated value proposition has resulted in continued strong generation of new accounts. And I'm excited about what I see. In terms of the new entrants, we see that less in the core credit cards space. But I would say very, very aggressive competition around personal loans by in that scenario where we focused on the long-term, remain disciplined in our underwriting and what we're willing to invest in new accounts and are used to seeing competitors come and go. Ryan Nash : Got it. And if I could ask a follow-up question to the question John asked prior, So John, in terms of marketing with the level you'd be hitting in the Fourth Quarter as it steps up a little bit, is -- should we think about that as a go-forward run rate? Are there more investments that needed to be made? And then second, there was comments about  increasing and -- as it relates to marketing, can you maybe just help us understand where are we today versus pre -pandemic levels, and what is the strategy the continued increase balance transfer activity on a go-forward basis? Thank you. John Greene : Sure. On the marketing spent, that will be determined -- are determined based on the opportunities we see as, as we look at 22, we do see a continued benign credit environment and frankly a very strong opportunity to drive profitable new account growth. As that opportunity continues to persist, we'll continue to spend marketing dollars. What I would suggest is we concentrate here on 2021 And then in the January call, we'll talk about '22 in terms of the opportunities there.  But I'll leave you with this point that the fourth-quarter trajectory should help inform what we intend to spend in 2022. In terms of balance transfers, we did see a impact from some of the increased balance transfers that we executed in early part of '21 and the third quarter in terms of mild impacts to margin. We will continue to take a look at that space and see what we can generate profitably. It's been a good source of account acquisition for us historically and will continue to remain disciplined and put those prime revolver accounts on the balance transfer. Ryan Nash : Thanks for taking my questions. John Greene : Thank you, Ryan. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Don Fandetti : Hi, good morning. I guess, Roger, a little bit of a longer-term question around your debit business. It seems like we're going to have more direct-to-bank payments in the United States over time and there's a lot going on, PayPal potentially buying Pinterest. Can you talk about how you see debit evolving over the long-term, and are there any implications given that you own a network? Roger Hochschild : Sure. Great question. There are always, I would say, new payment schemes and methods out there. A lot of them though, tend to rely on existing payments. So you think about when Apple launched their wallet. Even PayPal, the vast majority of their volume is processed to existing payment networks. And debit processing is incredibly complex and quite frankly very low margin, and very efficient as you look at how the 3 major debit networks, as MasterCard and Visa operate. And right now, given the interchange caps that a lot of banks have, the economics for them are relatively thin. So while we look at what the Fed might be proposing what goes on in other markets, I don't see anything in the near or even medium-term that looks like it has the potential. And quite frankly, you're starting to see an increase in volume here on the debit side. Even a lot of the buy now pay later players are leveraging debit for their payments. Don Fandetti : You don't see debit really going away per se and being replaced by direct-to-account payments in the U.S.? Roger Hochschild : No. The risk management of payments is quite complex in terms of both fraud and identity. There are lot of processes and controls that the major networks have in place. There's a robust ecosystem if you think about point-of-sale devices, merchant acquirers. And so, to think that that will change suddenly, I see is a low probability. Don Fandetti : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Hey, Roger, just following up on that. Is there an opportunity for you to take your debit network and debit capabilities, and expand it into that new, I wouldn't call it new, I guess, but into that revitalized interest in debit that we're seeing? Roger Hochschild : Yes. Great question, Betsy. Certainly we have a unique set of network assets and can provide connectivity to merchants whether through proxy card numbers or a series of other technologies, and work closely with a number of Fintechs around that. So that's the core of some of what we do with Sezzle. Actually that was the beginning of our relationship with Marqeta many years ago and they are a lot of others that are either in the market now, or but were in discussions with. So I think the pulse on the debit assets we have combined with our signature network or an advantage and one that we look to monetize. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then as we're thinking about the dance that's coming over the next couple of years between loan growth and credit normalization. Can you help us understand how you're thinking about managing that trajectory? Because what I heard earlier in the call is you've been getting more and more efficient at account acquisition, right? Part of your marketing spend coming in lower than expected or at least lower than consensus than we expected, is a function of you doing something, I don't know if it's cloud or technology or what, to get more efficient at account targeting and account acquisition.  So on the one hand, you've got that running in a very positive direction. You talked about the payment rates being a little bit of a headwind to monetizing that but at the same time, we've got credit normalizing. So is there an opportunity for you to pull levers on marketing to generate some more loan growth, or is it more likely to come from the personal loan side or the student loan side, as credits normalizing, how should we think about how you're managing that? John Greene : Betsy, I'll take this one. So there's a lot to that question. Let me just give a view in terms of what we're seeing as we closed out the third quarter. As I mentioned, the payment rate is stepping down and from August to September we expect that to continue. That will help certainly drive loan growth. My sense is today that there is a relationship between the payment rate and sales activity. So the persistently high payment rate, I think, has driven sales activity across the industry.  Now, we benefited, I would say slightly disproportionately in terms of driving incremental sales, partly due to the acquisition point you mentioned. So there's 2 dynamics, but third dynamic is credit normalizing. And my sense is that credit normalization will continue through '22 into '23. So today where I said I'm positive on credit. So those factors in the aggregate and addition to the point you mentioned in terms of account targeting, I think position us pretty well in '22 for positive loan growth, not the specific full come a little bit later in January when we give our view. But we're all positive on that front today. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then could you touch on what's driving that account acquisition being more efficient? You mentioned the process-oriented improvements or what specifically are you talking about there? Roger Hochschild : So Betsy, it's Roger again. A lot of the enhancements that we're seeing are leveraging the advanced analytics. And so that's really helping both on the underwriting side with swap in swap outs as well as better targeting combined with investments we're making from beginning to end in the Marchex stock. And we think those are already serving as well, but there's also plenty of upside as we continue to focus on that area. Betsy Graseck : Got it. All right. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning, Roger and John. John Greene : Good morning. Bill Carcache : I wanted to -- wanted to follow up on your conviction in more robust loan growth in 2022, if we were to get either in just modest mid-single-digit spending growth next year. Do you think the incremental tailwind from payment rate normalization could be enough to support double-digit loan growth. And just to clarify, on this point, did you -- did you say earlier, John, that you think we could see payment rates get back to normalized, maybe 2019 levels by the end of 2023? Is that a reasonable expectation? John Greene : So 2023 is the horizon that we're looking at for payment rate to normalize. And when that happens, we expect savings rate to return to normalized levels. So one view is continuing to watch the savings rate. And that should help inform payment rate. That's, frankly, one of the metrics we look at. In terms of robust loan growth in 2022, Let me just put it this way here because we're going to hold off until January on providing explicit details.  But the new account originations has been important for growth. Sales activity has been important for growth. The payment rate, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, has been a headwind, not completely expanding anticipated. We did see it mildly higher than what we had modeled, but we're still on track for delivering the loan growth that we talked about for '21 -- '22. It will be informed by all those factors and shared bill with more -- in more detail in January. Bill Carcache : Understood. Thanks. If I can follow up about a separate question on BNPL risk. I guess there's a group on one side that thinks that it's largely customers who can't qualify for credit and are just using the BNPL to turn their debit cards into credit cards. And we've heard the CEO of Sezzle, which we know is one of your partners, speak to that point. And then there's this other group that is more concerned about the competitive threat posed by certain BNPL players that do longer term installment lending and the risks that they'll eat into margins and pricing over time. Can you frame for us how you're thinking about the competitive threat? And now that you've had a little bit more time to study what's happening with the different BNPL players. John Greene : Sure. I'll start with them and while we had more time to study it, I'd say the market is not yet mature and I think market-clearing economics have yet to be established. Part of the challenge is there are many segments within buy-now pay-later, from the people financing a multi-thousand dollar purchase, which by the way, they've done for years in terms of traditional sales finance, versus more spreading out payments on $60 worth of cosmetics. So those segments all have different characteristics, certainly at the lower end there are many customers who are either debit preferring or do not have access to significant amounts of credit. But I think you'll continue to see it evolve. You're starting to see some pressure from merchants who are unwilling to pay, take rates above what they pay in card. Roger Hochschild : So right now, we certainly see opportunity on the payment side as I talked about earlier, leveraging our assets. Over time, we think there may be opportunity for us as an issuer, and again, partially leveraging our unique model on our proprietary network. But right now, I would say we're not seeing any noticeable impact on revolving loans and believe that we are well-positioned to respond if it does emerge. Bill Carcache : Thanks, Roger and John, I appreciate you taking my questions. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, Bill. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. I want to follow up on some of Ryan 's questions on competition. I guess, Roger, when you think about the competitive landscape on a go-forward basis, if you look at the post-financial crisis period, a lot of that competition was transactor-oriented, like people going up transactor customers. Do you think this time it's going to be a little different given what unfolded last time or do you think that it's going to be the same? I'm just curious as you think about how you're setting up competitively. Roger Hochschild : Sanjay, I am lucky enough to be able to look back over multiple cycles of competition and it has varied. Everything from an intense focus across the board on prime revolvers to transactors. I think certainly America Express will stay focused on that spend based model. A lot of banks focus on those transactors because they are very profitable customers. Not so much in card, but in other segments of the business.  The prime revolver space has historically been the most challenging in terms of what it requires from a value proposition and underwriting. For transactors it's really about rolling out our rich rewards program. So we expect to see competition across the spectrum, but what impacts us most will be that in the Prime revolver space. Sanjay Sakhrani : And you don't see any of that really intensifying relative to what you anticipated, commits pretty consistent? Roger Hochschild : Yeah, I would say it's intensified significantly since sort of the low during the pandemic, but is now getting back to I would say, more normalized levels. Sanjay Sakhrani : Got it. And then, John, just one follow-up on NIM. I know we're not talking about next year's guidance until next quarter, but just broadly speaking, as we sit here today with your NIM, pretty high levels just relative to history. As the growth comes, do you envision that to be a tailwind for the NIM or does that start counteracting some of this because the BT rates increased? I'm just curious how we should think about the progression going forward. Thanks. John Greene : Thanks, Sanjay. If you go back and look at NIM historically, you'll see that it was subjected to, frankly, higher funding costs from unsecured term debt. What we've tried to do is shore up the liability side of the balance sheets and targeting 70%, 80%, based from deposits and then the rest combination of secured and unsecured security offerings. So that will create stability in terms of the funding cost. In terms of pluses and minuses to the revenue line. What we'll say is some Peaky related impacts to NIM.  You'll see credit if it does normalize, a bit of credit, normalization. in terms of NIM. But you will also see that sustained impact from funding I just talked about. So we're looking at NIM to be higher than what we've experienced historically. And we're going to compare '21 how we ended -- end the year in terms of the balance sheet position and see how that impacts '22. But overall, I would say the funding position has created more stability and a economic benefit too to investors. Sanjay Sakhrani : Understood. Thank you. Operator : We will take the next question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America, please go ahead. Mihir Bhatia : Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Maybe the stock -- if you could just clarify a little bit on the marketing expense top guidance maybe for the fourth quarter. I understand you don't want to talk about 2022 yet. But just for the fourth quarter, when you talked about marketing expense you have relative to 2019 levels, are you talking on a quarterly basis so you know fourth-quarters? We're looking at 235 - ish million. I understand you may not want to give exact numbers, but should we be thinking on a quarterly basis or Jon a full-year basis? just given the backup in the first 3 quarters of the year, that would be a pretty big increase versus on a quarterly basis. I just want to make sure you clarify that. Thank you. John Greene : So thanks. When we referenced 2019, we're talking a full year basis. So then that would force folks to do a little bit of math on the third quarter and fourth quarter. We came in lower in the third quarter than we anticipated. Fourth quarter, we expect it will increase from the 210. So to, frankly, remove some ambiguity on this, so it will be somewhere in the range of 220 to, call it, 280. Mihir Bhatia : Thank you. John Greene : I hesitate to give that level of specificity, but given the confusion, I just wanted to put it away. Mihir Bhatia : Sure. And we appreciate that. Maybe just taking a step back on the credit side and just longer-term consumer credit performance. I think underwrite new accounts, can you just talk about what kind of through the cycle loss rate assumption you are making? I guess what I'm really trying to understand is what is the normalized loss rate for your credit card portfolio as you think about longer-term economics? John Greene : Yeah. So we would confirm we do use a through the cycle -- through the cycle loss rate and so do not use current losses, but that's not something we disclose. Mihir Bhatia : Okay. Thank you. John Greene : Thanks. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Aaron Citan Avec (ph) with Citi. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. The pace of spending by your cardholders accelerated a little bit in 3Q relative to 2019. Is that consistent through the quarter or did it show any signs of rising or falling in terms of the cadence, there? John Greene : We've seen ups and downs in particular, we talked about a bit of a soft thing around travel that occurred in August. And I think that was driven by a lot of what was going on with the pandemic. But we continue to see very robust sales volume, even continuing into October. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. And then the comments on the personal loan pricing of uncompetitive pressures there, is that mainly from new entrants in the market where we're seeing a lot of different types of personal loan models coming to market in the past couple of years. Is that something that you would expect to continue as competitive pressure going forward, or is this more of a just marking down relative to where the existing book was? Roger Hochschild : A lot of it is coming into from new entrants. Personal loans are probably the easiest to fund outside of a bank and have the easiest servicing requirements. And so that's where a lot of the new entrants will go with new models. We are disciplined both on credit, but as well as pricing. And we will not go below the targeted returns we want to hit. A lot of times that will flush its way through when they either don't get the performance that they want to see or have other challenges. You do get sometimes you are prioritizing growth over returns, but that tends not to last for too long. Operator : Will take next questions from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead. Mark De Vries : Yes. Thanks. Just had a question about what you're seeing in the student lending space on when your competitors has noted some headwinds in the quarter. Just how is that shaping up? John Greene : We feel pretty good about peak season volumes were up roughly seven percent year-over-year. And we believe that we gained share. Although we're still sort of processing. So clearly, we saw one major competitor step back last year, but we're very excited about that market. We underwrite it into a very disciplined way and it's a great way to get a really good product in our brand in front of the next generation of prime cardholders. Mark De Vries : Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up question on polls. Some -- and as you know, you've had some pretty strong volumes there. Roger, is there a point at which you start to get some meaningful scale benefits and the earnings contribution from that becomes more meaningful and grows faster than the volumes? Roger Hochschild : We would love to increase the percent of our earnings that comes out of the payments segment. I think one of the challenges we also are working pretty hard to increase earnings from our banking segment. So we're not standing still there either. It's -- while we're excited about Pulse, it's also very competitive. We're battling for routing at the merchant level with Visa MasterCard day in, day out, we've seen a lot of growth from expanding from traditional PIN-debit to card-not-present. And so that's been particularly helpful. But we're very focused on growing that business. Mark De Vries : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Maybe just to come back to the new account acquisition. Is there, particularly in card, is there a way to talk about either is there are any different channels that you are using or what's the nature of the consumer? Is there any differences in the type of consumer that you're seeing? Roger Hochschild : Not really, Moshe. I don't think we've seen anything dramatic since prior to the pandemic. Clearly they continued migration to digital channels. Direct mail becomes a smaller and smaller piece, but that's been a trend for many years now. So we continually are fine-tuning the digital channels. I guess what we've seen is a greater ability to measure the results of top of final spend. As it shifts more digital, when that spend moves from TV to even video, that's online, you can do a better job with tracking and attribution. And so we are repositioning how we spend, and that's one of the areas we're leveraging some of our advanced analytics. Moshe Orenbuch : Got you, thank you. As you mentioned, using balanced transfer as part of this. You talked a little bit about, anything you can share with us in terms of whether they are all at 0 or are there some that are at yields above 0 and any kind of update on what you've seen in terms of retention of those balances. Roger Hochschild : Sure. Probably one of the bigger trend, there was a real collapse in balanced transferred demand, during the pandemic. Clearly, a lot of issuers were pulling back on credit line increases, but I think consumers were much more focused on paying down there debt versus moving it around. So you saw a softening in demand for personal loans and balance transfers, that's starting to come back. For us, a lot of our acquisition offers are at zero percent. The portfolio offers tends to either be above zero or have a fee that provides a pretty effective yield. And as John pointed out, for most of those, we see a very high return from the balanced transfer itself, given this funding environment, as well as a good percent sticking. And that's something we modeled very carefully. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer, please go ahead. Dominick Gabriele : Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I guess if we just think about the comments around the economic outlook getting for early assumptions around your economic outlook, becoming a slightly worse from the third quarter -- from the second quarter to the third quarter, but then being incrementally positive into '22 credit trends, can you just square those two pieces together? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. Happy to, Dominick. When we modeled in the second quarter, frankly, the economists saw a higher level of GDP growth and employment returning to normalized levels sooner. And when we updated those, the GDP had come down, employment returning to normalized levels pushed event. So that was one of multiple inputs. We provide that detail because it's frankly the most transparent that people can take a look at to get a view of how we're thinking about the reserves.  Now, the other items that are important in terms of our thinking here in the third quarter was, first, portfolio performance and it's been super strong. Second, was the ending of many of the government's work programs related to COVID. So most of those ended in August and September. What we'd like to do is see some seasoning of the impacts of those into the fourth quarter and perhaps even in the first quarter next year. If what we expect is that the impact of that seasoning will be very, very mild on the portfolio.  And the magnet -- the broad macros continue to look favorable. There's enough points of reference that would lead us to begin to step the reserves back to day 1. But a lot of things need to happen and we ended up where we were on the third quarter, ran through multiple models, multiple scenarios, and we got comfortable with where we were to make sure the balance sheet was fairly stated. But we do see that the broad macros out into the future are positive. So we'll see how they sustain and make a call in the fourth and in 2022. Dominick Gabriele : Great, thanks for that. And if you all think about how the hierarchy of products that you have, as well as across the consumer space for normalization on which products could normalize. Perhaps let's just -- I don't know in -- to even maybe 2019 levels NCO rates. Are there certain products you would expect to normalize either faster than other products or any color you can provide along the trajectory of one product versus the other, given what you're seeing in your customer base would be awesome? Thank you so much. John Greene : Yeah. That's a difficult thing to do in that it will be subject to the economic environment. So we know historically if there is a period of tougher financial situation, the personal loans will be the ones that get the least priority in terms of payment. Credit cards tend to be high. The student loans, given the long duration of those contracts, they don't seem to gyrate as much with the economic output place of that so much of our portfolios co-sign that it provides additional coverage there. So you get to personal loans subject to the economic environment. And then the card, my sense is the card has been prioritized in terms of the payment hierarchy because of what has happened in terms of cash in the digital environment, it's really difficult to shop without a card these days. So I look for stability there. Dominick Gabriele : Great. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Operator : And our final question will come from Bill Ryan with Seaport Research, please go ahead. Bill Ryan : Thank you and good morning. A couple of questions. One on the personal loans business. I believe you've been in the business since 2007. Lot of new entrants in the marketplace today, you talked about it. But I remember 2/3 of your book is roughly from the existing Discover Credit card file but the other third historically coming from the other place out-of-market or out of your existing file. As far as the underwriting you're seeing from the new entrants, you talked a little bit about it, but I was wondering if you could take a little bit more granular approach to it, and talk about, are they making compromises relative to what you're willing to do on credit, payment income, yield verification, all the above. And second, just going back to the bonus accruals. A lot of companies are stepping up bonuses as employee retention efforts. Is this something we should kind of view is transitory onetime? Or might this transfer into a little bit higher compensation expense going into next year? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : I'll start with the bonus accrual. We haven't made any changes to our bonus program. So to the extent there are changes in bonus are cool, at your reflects for stronger financial performance this year versus last year and -- then how that translates. In terms of personal loans space, it is very hard to get line of sight into the practices of these companies, and there are many of them. We've seen them came and go over multiple cycles.  In general, I would say they tend to have fewer manual or labor-intensive processes. So I'd be surprised if they did the extent of employment verification we do. And again, it might be appropriate if their average ticket is lower. They may have different return profiles. The one thing I would say, the vast majority lend to a much broader spectrum than we do. And so we focus on the prime segment, again, primarily debt consolidation. But it is hard to generalize across the many different new entrants that may have different models. Bill Ryan : Thank you. Eric Wasserstrom : Excellent. Well, thank you all for joining us, and if you have any further questions, please reach out to the IR team. We'll be around all day to address them. Thanks again, and have a great day. Operator : Okay, and this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at anytime.",

Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our fourth quarter earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Green, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, you will be permitted to ask one question, followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up question, please return to the queue.  Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'll begin by reviewing the highlights and key metrics for the year, then John will take you through the details of our fourth quarter results and our perspectives on 2022. 2021 was another year of unique challenges related to the pandemic, and I'm very pleased that once again, the Discover team was able to successfully execute against our business priorities in a fluid operating environment. This was evident in our fourth quarter results which were the capstone to an outstanding year. For the fourth quarter, we earned $1.1 billion after tax or $3.64 per share; and for the full year, $5.4 billion after tax or $17.83 per share. These results underscore the strength of our differentiated model and were achieved as we continue to make meaningful enhancements to our capabilities and invest for future growth. Let me share a few examples from this past year. Throughout 2021, we continue to make advancements to our data and analytics platform, enhancing our capabilities in areas including targeting, collections and fraud detection. We also made investments in machine learning to provide faster and better insights to improve customer personalization. And we continue to modernize our infrastructure and build out our hybrid cloud platform. We also opened a new customer care center in Chatham, a vibrant African-American community on Chicago South side. Once fully operational, the center will provide nearly 1,000 full-time jobs. Our Chatham Center challenges the traditional notions of corporate site selection, has helped us connect with a talented pool of diverse candidates and suppliers, is transforming how we approach diversity, equity and inclusion and it is already performing at an industry-leading level. We hope our commitment to Chatham will serve as a springboard for further economic development in other areas that have long been denied opportunity. Slide 4 of our presentation captures another important element of our results, which was our pivot into new account acquisition as the economic recovery took hold in late 2020 and early 2021. In the face of intensifying competition, our value proposition of cashback rewards, no annual fee and industry-leading service remain very attractive to consumers. The strong level of card acquisition contributed to our return to loan growth over the second half of last year. In payments, we continue to expand our business, increase network volume and establish new strategic partnerships. We expanded global acceptance and announced new network alliances in Portugal, Bahrain, Jordan and Malaysia that will benefit us as cross-border travel recovers. We remain committed to building out our international acceptance, and we'll continue to make investments to expand our reach. Our record earnings through the year generated significant capital, which we continue to put to good use. In addition to our investments in acquisition, brands, technology and people, we also returned significant capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks by repurchasing $2.3 billion of common stock and increasing our quarterly dividend by 14%. As we look forward into 2022, I'm very optimistic about the trajectory of our business. While macroeconomic conditions created strong tailwinds this past year, we acted on opportunities to strengthen our business, actions that will drive long-term value this year and beyond. We start the new year in an excellent position, and I'm confident that our integrated digital banking and payments model will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders and customers. I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our quarterly financial results in more detail. John Greene : Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. As we review our fourth quarter results, I echo Roger's point that the actions we took last year position us for strong performance in 2022 and beyond. I'll begin with our financial summary on Slide 5. Our strong fourth quarter results were characterized by accelerating receivable growth, provision leverage and increased investments in marketing and brand. Revenue, net of interest expense, increased 4% from the prior year. Excluding a $139 million unrealized loss on our equity investments, total revenue was up 9%. Net interest income increased 4% driven by growth in average receivables and an 18 basis point improvement in our net interest margin, which was sequentially flat at 10.81%. Our NIM trend reflects the continued benefit from decreased funding cost and lower interest charge-offs, though these were partially offset in the fourth quarter by a higher mix of promotional rate balances. The growth in receivables was largely driven by card, which was up 4% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. The primary drivers of year-over-year growth were continued strong sales volume and significant new account growth throughout 2021, which was up 23% year-over-year and 13% versus 2019. As has been the case for most of last year, a significant portion of the benefits from strong sales and new accounts was offset by the sustained high payment rate. The payment rate leveled off during the quarter but remains approximately 500 basis points above pre-pandemic levels. We currently expect that the payment rate will decline slightly over the course of 2022. However, our expectations for card receivable growth is robust, as I'll detail in a few moments. Our student loan portfolio also contributed to our growth. Organic student loans were up 4% over the prior year, benefiting from the return to in-person learning in 2021. We continue to gain share in this product and are well positioned for continued organic expansion. Personal loans decreased 3% year-over-year, mainly driven by high payment rates, but were sequentially flat as we returned our underwriting criteria to pre-pandemic levels. The second significant driver of our revenue growth was higher net discount/interchange revenue, which increased $103 million or 43%, driven by a 25% increase in sales volume year-over-year. The strong volume has continued into this year. Sales are up 24% through the first half of January. One significant item that relates to our net discount and interchange revenue is our rewards cost, and having covered most of our key revenue drivers, I'll point your attention to the reward rate reflected on Slide 8. We continue to benefit from strong card member engagement with our cashback rewards program. Our rewards costs increased versus last year on higher sales volume. However, the reward rate declined 3 basis points year-over-year and 9 basis points sequentially. This reflects the benefit of our integrated model and our discipline in managing the program while delivering substantial value to card members and merchant partners. For the full year 2021, our rewards rate was 1.37%, up 2 basis points from the prior year. Consistent with the historical trend, we expect about 2 basis points to 4 basis points of annual rewards cost inflation, driven mostly by shifts in mix. Now, I'd like to spend a moment speaking about expense trends on Slide 9. Total operating expenses increased $34 million or 3% year-over-year. Focusing on the most significant items here, marketing expense was up $112 million as we continue to invest in new account growth and brand marketing with the launch of our new media campaign, which went live across all channels in the quarter. This pushed our marketing expense towards the top end of our previously guided range. Employee compensation was down $5 million year-over-year, driven mainly by a $26 million charge last year. Excluding this, our comp expense was up 4% year-over-year, driven largely by a higher bonus accrual. Information processing was down $73 million year-over-year and professional fees increased as a result of higher recovery fees. Moving to credit on Slide 10, the net charge-off rate improved to 1.37% in the quarter, a decrease of 101 basis points year-over-year and a 9 basis point improvement from the prior quarter. Net charge-off dollars were down 218 million from the prior year and decreased 12 million sequentially. Strong credit performance continued across all products. Card net charge-offs were down 113 basis points from the prior year and personal loans were 158 basis points lower. Student loan charge-offs increased slightly but remained very low at 0.8%. Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 11, our reserve rate continued to decline, dropping 38 basis points to 7.3%. Two factors contributed to the decrease in reserve rate. First, we released $50 million from reserves during the quarter, driven by the continued strong credit performance of our portfolio and the relative stability of the macroeconomic outlook. These factors were partially offset by the 5% increase in total loans from the prior quarter. Our future reserves will be dictated by our portfolio credit trends, our receivable growth and any changes to our macroeconomic assumptions. Looking at Slide 12, we remain extremely well capitalized and above our 10.5% target with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 14.8%. We continue to demonstrate our commitment of returning capital to shareholders as we executed on our share repurchase plan and bought back $773 million of common stock in the quarter and paid a dividend of $0.50 per share. Looking at funding, average consumer deposits decreased 3% year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially. This sequential decline was driven by a 5% decrease in consumer CDs, while savings and money market deposits increased slightly. We managed our excess liquidity down throughout 2021 and finished the year with consumer deposits representing 68% of total funding. We will continue to target 70% to 80% of funding from the starts. Moving to Slide 13 where we'll provide some perspectives on 2022. We entered the year in a very strong position, and our outlook reflects this. We expect loan growth in the high single digits. This view is based on current expectations of sales trends and the contribution from recently acquired accounts, combined with a very modest decline in the payment rate. We believe this view of payment rates substantially derisked our loan growth forecast. We expect our NIM rate to be relatively in line with the full year of 2021 and with quarter-to-quarter variability. We expect to benefit from higher loan yields with rising interest rates. This may be offset by other factors, including a higher mix of promotional rate balances, some degree of credit normalization and higher deposit rates, which will be subject to funding needs and competitive dynamics. Turning to expenses, we expect our total GAAP expenses will increase at a mid-single-digit rate this year. We'll continue to invest for growth as we see profitable opportunities and currently expect that our marketing investments will be above 2019 levels. Outside of marketing, we expect operating costs to increase at a low single-digit percent level, reflecting disciplined expense control. Our commitment to positive operating leverage over the medium term remains a priority. We expect net credit losses will average in the range of 2.2% to 2.6% for the full year. As credit normalizes from historically low levels in 2021, we expect net charge-offs to increase sequentially over the course of the year. Lastly, we remain committed to returning substantial capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. As of this week, we had approximately $780 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization that expires at the end of March and expect to announce a new share repurchase authorization next quarter. In summary, we had an excellent fourth quarter and full year with accelerating loan growth driven by robust account acquisition and strong sales volumes, excellent credit performance and a reduction in the reserve rate, disciplined management of operating cost and sustained return of excess capital to shareholders. I'm exceptionally pleased with Discover's execution against our business priorities in 2021. Our value proposition continues to resonate with consumers. We prudently invested for growth, resulting in significant new account growth and strong sales. We continue to optimize our funding mix and actively manage core deposit costs. These actions and the improved macroeconomic outlook have positioned us well. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Britney, to open the line for Q&A. Operator : . We'll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks and congratulations on pretty strong numbers here. Maybe just focus on the account growth, it was up 11%. Could you talk about like how that compares in terms of just raw numbers of accounts to where you would have been pre-pandemic in the cost? And anything you've done kind of from a difference in channel or credit box to get there? Roger Hochschild : Yes, we don't disclose the number of new accounts. But what I would say in terms of credit, our card credit policies are pretty much on top of where they were pre-pandemic. Costs have gone up since the low levels that we saw during the pandemic as we sort of kept marketing and a lot of others pulled back. But I would say, as we look forward into 2022, our expectation is that the cost per account will be roughly where it was pre-pandemic. Moshe Orenbuch : And just as a follow-up, very pleased to hear that the commitment to operating leverage and the numbers you put out there would suggest kind of an upper single-digit revenue growth rate and a mid-single-digit expense growth rate. Could you talk about even if it's unlikely, what would happen to your expense expectations if revenue growth just didn't materialize? Like how would you make adjustments there? John Greene : Yes. Hey, Moshe, I'll take that one. So we'll react based on the company performance and opportunities that we see in the marketplace. So, over the past couple of years, I feel like the team has done a really, really good job in terms of making calls, in terms of expense allocations. We'll continue to do that to make sure that we're positioned for growth and marching towards the positive operating leverage that we talked about. Operator : We will take our next question from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : Could you give us a little more color about what you're seeing in credit right now? I mean, I think the guidance around charge-offs calls for some pretty meaningful normalization in 2022. And what kind of gets you to the low end of that guidance range and what gets you to the high end? John Greene : Great. Mark, thanks for the questions. So what we're seeing in the portfolio is really, really strong performance. I think the numbers in the quarter demonstrate that. We are seeing some difference between higher FICO and lower FICO account performance overall within expectations. So what we're projecting here is a slow normalization of credit, and in terms of the guidance that we reflected here, we've got pretty good line of sight to the first 6 months, just as the accounts will go through the normal roll rates and gives us an ability to predict quite accurately. Once we get out beyond 6 months, we rely more heavily on our models and the models themselves are built with a number of assumptions. '21 was -- frankly, was a tough year to call based on how we had designed our models and what actually happened in the portfolio. So what we decided to do is give, from my standpoint, a relatively broad range that we think over time we'll be able to tighten. And in terms of lower end versus higher end, strong portfolio performance, the slight difference that we saw between the higher FICO and the lower FICOs, that continuing to kind of roll out as we expect. And a positive macro environment should bring us towards the lower end. Mark DeVries : Just a follow-up on that. On the model that you use, is there some element of just mean reversion when charge-offs are this low relative to kind of normal that will push your estimates higher even if kind of all the macro drivers seem like they're more of a tailwind than a headwind? John Greene : Yes. There is a level of mean revision in there in the second part of the year. And just -- one other piece of, I'll say, information, so you can think about the breakout, at least this is how we thought about it, of charge-offs, the predominant piece in the second half of the year. So you can think 45-55 split between first half and second half. And we'll continue to update that over the year. Operator : We will take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Just thinking about NIM. Understanding you guys are guiding for a relatively flat NIM this year, but even thinking this year and beyond given that we're in a rate hike cycle you're in -- I guess, the last cycle was 2015 to 2019, and your card yields went up about 50% of the Fed funds changes and prime changes, and your cost of capital went -- or your deposits went up a little less than that. I'm just wondering as we go into this rate cycle, should we expect any differences in that kind of -- in that call it, NIM input range, is there any mix shift in the deposits that will cause the betas to be different there or is there any different policies with respect to zero balance transfers that we should think about just in terms of the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations as the government or the Fed raises rates? John Greene : Yes, it's actually a pretty complex question there. So rather than try to hit each of the elements, I'll give you a view in terms of how we thought about NIM for 2021. So we do expect some impact to NIM from credit normalization. We also -- we also are expecting a higher mix of BT and promotional balances, which will also impact net interest margin. We do get nice fees from that, but certainly, net interest margin will be impacted. The revolve rate as the payment rate starts to normalize, we'll see some benefits there. Fed funds rate changes, we plan for 2, 2 in the year. If there's more, that will create some upside. And in terms of impact there, you could expect per Fed change somewhere between 3 bps and 5 bps on a total year basis on NIM depending on timing. And then funding, we're still going to see some funding benefit from the actions we did to optimize our debt stack in '20 and '21. So from that standpoint, it gets us to about flat, but there's a lot of moving pieces. In terms of deposit pricing, there's still a wide gap between where we're priced and the brick-and-mortar banks are priced. So somewhere close to 45 basis points. Now the digital banks, most have increased deposit pricing, about 10 basis points over the past 3 to 4 weeks. We're a lagger on that. At some point, our funding needs and competitive dynamics will be such that we'll take a look and make appropriate changes and we'll do that throughout the year. So the deposit betas, specifics around that, I would rather think about competitive dynamics and funding needs in order to get a view on how we're going to price deposits on the up cycle. John Hecht : A follow-up question, I guess, unrelated is, you're in the zone of where you were on your allowance levels as we entered post CECL implementation and pandemic era. Are we at a point now where you kind of say this is the new base for ALL ex changes that are economic forecast? Or is there any kind of further room for allowance bleeds tied to increases during the last couple of years? John Greene : Yes. So we go through a pretty robust process every single quarter to make sure that our reserves are fairly stated under GAAP. Now when we did CECL day 1, we had -- we were seeing charge-offs in the low 3s, and we ended up posting reserve rate of, I think it was 6.09%. So as we look at where we are today, where it's at around 7.2, assuming strong credit performance and a positive macroeconomic outlook, my sense is that there is some opportunity to take that reserve rate closer to day 1. Operator : We will take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Richard Shane : I'm actually curious if there's some sort of 80-20 rule that impacts payment rate. What I'm curious is, if you guys have done any analysis on revolve versus transaction behavior differing by spending categories specifically like everyday spend versus large episodic spend. And I'm wondering if what we're seeing in terms of payment rates with all the other factors is being impacted by BNPL. John Greene : Yes. I wouldn't say there's an 80-20 rule on payment rate. So quite honestly, as we looked at it, in 2021, we didn't call the curve right. And so what we did in the '22 guidance is assumed a very modest decrease in payment rate. We felt like that derisked our loan growth. In terms of kind of behaviors between revolvers and transactors, that payment rate's been relatively consistent. The 1 difference in our portfolio is the new accounts that we originated in 2020 tended to be higher FICOs. So more of those tend to transact versus revolve. But we'll see as the liquidity ends up getting used in the overall economy and what that does to payment rates. So we've modeled it multiple different ways. There's really no standard rule of thumb. It's frankly somewhat dynamic in terms of what we're seeing month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. Roger Hochschild : And just to build on that, we look pretty carefully by merchant, by customer segment. There's nothing to support a view that buy now, pay later is having any impact on payment rate. Operator : And we will take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : First question, I guess, for Roger, just on the competitive backdrop. Obviously, we've gotten bank earnings and a lot of the large banks are talking about investing more in marketing, and you guys have some pretty aggressive growth targets. How should we think about sort of the risks to that target given the competitive backdrop? Roger Hochschild : Good question, Sanjay. As I mentioned earlier, our forecast for next year is cost per account, relatively flat to where it was before the pandemic. And so I think this sort of focus on competition is a little bit overblown. The card business is just always competitive. You have big players with good capabilities. Each issuer out there has their set of products, set of channels. And I think some natural limits on how much money they can be put to work effectively. So I don't see it as a particularly high risk to our 2022 growth forecast. And we have a very differentiated product, we're seeing good benefits on the acquisition side, from our investments in analytics. So we feel good even in the current environment. Sanjay Sakhrani : And I guess I have one for John. The noninterest income revenue line has done quite well over the course of this year, even excluding -- obviously, excluding the investment gains. Could you just talk about what kind of growth we should expect in that line going forward? John Greene : Yes. So the big driver there was obviously discount and interchange revenue, which was up 28% year-over-year and then after rewards cost 43% in the quarter. So super strong growth there, which that will generally run consistent with sales, and we're expecting sales not to stay in the mid 20s, but kind of come down to kind of strong double-digits and then into weaker double-digits by the fourth quarter. I don\u2019t know if that's right or not, it seems like there's been a lot of benefit from the new account acquisition and also where our card has been positioned with people's wallets. So that's been positive. There's also the factor that people are using less cash and charging more. So that'll continue to benefit sales, interchange and net discount and interchange.  In terms of the other items, the amount of cash in the economy actually helped cash advance fees which was positive. And our expectation is that we'll have outside of discount and interchange growth, growth fairly similar to net interest income. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : One, maybe it's a little bit of a theoretical question, but I'm just trying to understand how you are thinking about borrower capacity, the borrowing capacity of your customer set relative to pre-COVID. And I am asking the question because, jobs more available, wages rising. So that seems like they might have more capacity to borrow, but then we've got inflation increasing. So how do you think through those things? Roger Hochschild : It will, of course, vary by segment. But certainly, households that are seeing rising incomes will have a greater ability for debt service. And for many households, that's how they determine how much debt they take on. It's complicated a bit by some households still having pent-up savings from strong earnings and not many opportunities to spend. And of course, other costs going up, whether it's child care or day-to-day expenses, on 1 hand, will drive increases in sales. But on the other hand, decreases disposable income for debt service. So a mix of factors, but we, net-net, we'd expect strong consumer demand for credit next year. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then as I'm thinking about the other legs of the loan growth platform here, student loan and personal, could you talk through how you see those drivers impacting the 2022 growth guide that you've got? Roger Hochschild : Sure. So student loans, we feel really good about where we're positioned in the market, our products, our brand, our ability to take share. What's a bit the wildcard is just enrollment. And I think enrollments were down year-over-year, which was a surprise to, I think, the entire higher education industry. There's a bit of a correlation, the stronger the job market fewer people decide to pursue an education because they're making too much outside. So I think it will be more that factor, and we'll see peak season. But I'm confident in our ability to continue gaining share. For personal loans, we took a little longer to return to pre-pandemic credit criteria for that product, just given the higher volatility. But as John said, quarter-over-quarter, we're now flat. And so we would expect that to return to growth in 2022. Betsy Graseck : And the balance transfer activity, there's a bit of a link between personal and card. I know balance transfer comes before personal loan growth, but how's that legging in at this stage? Is that -- has there been a take-up beginning there yet or is that more of a back half '22 outlook? Roger Hochschild : So John talked about promotional balances as having an impact on NIM. I would say a lot of that is driven by new accounts. So as you ramp up new accounts, you'll see that, but also portfolio activity as well. Operator : We will take our next question from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Kevin Barker : Given your growth rates that you're projecting out there, I mean do you feel like you can achieve sub-40% efficiency ratio sometime in the foreseeable future, whether it be run rate close to late '22, maybe early 2023? John Greene : We specifically commented on positive operating leverage. So as we deliver that, obviously, the efficiency ratio will improve. My expectation is that we can get into the high 30s within the medium term. So we built the plan essentially contemplating significant investment in marketing and then working through the other elements of the cost structure in order to create as much efficiency and capacity to drive new growth. As that model continues to build upon itself, my expectation is that those high 30 numbers are certainly very, very achievable. Kevin Barker : And then a follow-up on some of your comments around credit. I believe you said you expect it to increase sequentially throughout the year. Did I hear that correctly? And then I mean, could you just give us a little bit more detail on your expectations for the cadence of net charge-offs, given we're at an exceptionally low level? And typically, you have quite a bit of seasonality. Can you just give us a little bit more color around your expected cadence on charge-offs throughout the year? John Greene : Yes. So it will be difficult to expand more deeply upon the comments that I've already made. So we do expect it to increase sequentially. There is some degree of seasonality I don't view that as like a material driver to what we're going to be seeing. And I also mentioned that the charge-offs are more first half of the year, and that we've got pretty decent line of sight to the first half. So that's split out somewhere around 45 first half, 55 second half is probably as deep as I can go on the charge-off numbers right now. Operator : And we will take our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Roger, as you come out of the pandemic, I was just curious if there's any areas of strategic interest, new products, et cetera, that you're looking at. It's been pretty consistent for the last several years. Roger Hochschild : Yes. Certainly, we're always looking for new opportunities on the payment side of our business. And there, the versatility of our capabilities, you saw some of that with our partnership with Sezzle in terms of our ability to provide easier connectivity to merchants. So on the payment side, both in the U.S. and globally, we're looking for opportunities. On the card side, we feel really good about the product set we have. We are virtually 100% focused on consumer. I think there is a huge opportunity to continue to grow our non-card products. And so we talked about investing more in marketing our deposit products before the pandemic. Clearly, when we were in a significant excess liquidity position. It didn't make sense to put a lot of marketing behind deposits. But that's something I would expect to see in 2022. Don Fandetti : And any changes on your international acceptance push? Or is it sort of you just kind of inch your way into growth? Roger Hochschild : We continue to push out. I think what you heard in the call, our favorite way of expanding internationally through network-to-network partnerships. It is just much more cost-effective than working with individual acquirers, although we do that as well. There's also a big focus on acceptance in the U.S. around the migration to digital. So working with other networks on secure remote commerce, everything from transit implementations, but again, we're now up to 26 net-to-net partnerships, and feel that there's room to continue growing recently announced a partnership in Serbia actually this week. Operator : And we will take our next question from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : I just want to follow up on one of the answers you had before. Do you think that the ability to reach more customers and spur spend through marketing has an overall direct relationship between which FICO band or income level these customers have? And is this why you think perhaps there could be those diminishing returns on marketing investment at perhaps slightly different overall rates between what customer base 1 issuer may have versus another? And I have a follow-up. Roger Hochschild : Yes. I don't think we said we expected diminishing returns on marketing. Credit is pretty similar to what it was pre-pandemic and I mentioned our projected cost per account. And a lot of our marketing does go to new accounts. Cost per account, we're projecting that to be pretty much on top of where it was pre-pandemic. Different issuers certainly have different business models. There's one who's particularly focused on subprime, others are much more aggressive at the super prime. We have been very clear for many, many years that ours is a lend-focused business going after that prime revolver segment. We've tailored our products for that, our underwriting capabilities. And again, we feel very good about the return we're getting on the dollars we spend in marketing. Dominick Gabriele : And can you maybe talk about how the competitive landscape is evolving and what products are likely to either meaningfully compete, not ultimately compete and somewhat compete with your everyday spend credit card products? And perhaps maybe which spend categories may be most of that competition could reside versus least likely? Roger Hochschild : Yes. I think clearly, what everyone's watching is buy now pay later. As I mentioned earlier, we haven't seen that have a noticeable impact on our base. In my mind, it's closer to traditional sales finance. So there have always been competing products out there, whether it's on the private label side, whether it's personal loans for debt consolidation, et cetera. So we focus on getting a broad mix of spend. Even through this year, we're seeing strong performance across every category. Travel is holding up actually in January surprisingly well, given the state of that pandemic. So we think we'll continue to grow across categories. And in fact, as one of the beauties of our 5% program, it sort of reinforces different categories of spend on a rotating basis as opposed to products that are really particularly tailored to an individual category of spend. Operator : And we will take our next question from Robert Napoli with William Blair. Robert Napoli : Roger, John, nice quarter. I really like the guide on loan growth versus expense growth. Just on the expense growth side, I mean, if you -- there's a lot of investment going on in certainly at some of the major banks on technology. And I know that Discover has invested in technology over the years. I would just -- maybe just your thought process on where your tech stack stands, is -- your thoughts on private cloud versus public cloud and the need to invest to compete over the next several years? Roger Hochschild : Yes, good question. I think our perspective may be a little different than some of the big banks. And of course, we have a narrower range of businesses. So I can't really comment on some of their investment. Certainly, we are focused on competing with the fintechs, but it's not just about spending money. It reminds me of -- it's like someone saying, I'm just going to keep eating more and more until I lose weight. The competition -- those fintechs are not spending more on technology. Our focus is around capabilities, it's on agility, it's on speed to market. And so if you look at last year, once you sort of sort through for onetime items, technology spend was relatively flat, but that doesn't mean there wasn't a huge focus around our capabilities. We've talked about our investments in data and analytics. So it's really more about speed, and you don't get there just through sheer dollars of spending. Robert Napoli : And I guess -- I mean, I guess private cloud versus public cloud and the importance of your cloud strategy\u2026 Roger Hochschild : Yes, so great question. We're focused on a hybrid cloud strategy, so a mix of both. I think there's -- sometimes companies seem to take a purist element that there's something great about having 100% of your applications on the cloud, whether or not your GL resides on the cloud, it\u2019s not going to really make a difference for your business. But we are heavy users of the public cloud, in particular, for our data and analytics areas where the speed and massive amounts of storage are critically important. Robert Napoli : And if I could just sneak in, your spend growth was really strong. How much of that is inflation? But what are your thoughts on inflation and how it affects your business, and the impact that maybe it's having on the spend growth numbers you reported, which were pretty strong? John Greene : Yes, Bob, I'll take that. We've been really pleased with the sales running through the card. The inflation has had a small impact. So you think kind of on average, maybe 1% to 2% in \u201821. In \u201822, we didn't model that out specifically. My sense is it would be 2%. Operator : We will take our next question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : Maybe first, I just wanted to go back and just clarify a little bit about your guidance. I just want to make sure I understand some of the key assumptions embedded in there. So first, like on payment rates, I think you said you expect it to slightly decline a little bit in 2022. And I was wondering, if we were to see normalization happen a little bit faster, let's say, they normalize back to the normalized levels in 2022, would that push your loan growth up to like low double-digits or am I -- or is that like too ambitious in terms of like the impact? What I'm trying to understand is the impact of the payment rate on loan growth there? And then just also related to just this guidance question just on rate hikes, and I apologize if I missed this in your earlier comments. Did you say how many rate hikes or how many basis points you were assuming in your guidance? John Greene : Yes. So we assumed -- thanks for the questions. We assumed 2 rate hikes in our guidance. And in terms of payment rate, as I said, very modest improvement, so -- or a reduction. So if payment rate were to normalize at the pace you just described, which I don't think it will, but if it were to do that, it would certainly be very accretive to the loan growth. I'm not going to get into specifics whether it takes us to double-digits or not. Mihir Bhatia : Okay, no, I understand. That's helpful though. And then just wanted to -- the other question I will ask is just about understanding your credit underwriting or risk appetite currently, you did mention normalization is happening maybe a little bit more on the lower FICOs. Have you tweaked your underwriting or marketing in the last few weeks or quarters in response to that or is it still very much as expected, so it's all systems go? Roger Hochschild : Yes. No, we haven't. And I think it's important to note that the life of loan losses, assumptions we use for new account underwriting is not driven by where losses are currently. So John  all portfolio performance and what we're seeing. But we use sort of by segment and actually by individual account forecasts of life of loan as we determine our marketing and credit criteria. Operator : And we will take our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Is there any reason to be concerned about the pace of credit normalizing faster than receivables growth? John Greene : From my perspective, no, and I'll tell you why. First, the macros are the macroeconomic conditions that are super positive, right? So there's more job openings than there are people looking for jobs. The consumers will have more dollars into their paycheck as a result of this inflation. And there is a substantial amount of savings still left in the economy from -- largely from kind of change in behaviors and government stimulus. So I'm not frankly seeing that as a risk in 2023 -- excuse me, 2022. As we get out into 2023, there's less certainty around that. Bill Carcache : Maybe a related follow-up, there's a lot of consternation around NCOs normalizing higher, but do you think that the environment that we're in today, where you're seeing the revenue benefits from the accelerating loan growth that you're putting up on 1 hand, and then also on top of that, you've also got the reserve rate remaining well above day 1 levels. And so when you think about the risk of growth, headwinds and the need to build reserves on that strong loan growth that you're seeing, the risk that, that overwhelms the revenue benefits from the loan growth and the fact that the reserve rate is higher, can you talk to that interplay and how you're thinking about that? John Greene : Yes. So when we -- let me start with the reserves because it plays into the rest of your question. So when we looked at reserves for the quarter, what we wanted to see was the impact of the ending, the end of most of the government support programs. Most ended in September. So we had 1 quarter worth of data. We looked at it, we saw no real change to the portfolio dynamics. We're hoping to see another quarter and then reevaluate overall reserve rate. But that day 1 number and the -- I'll say, the normalized charge-offs in the 3s would support a view that down the road, we'll have some opportunity on reserves. In terms of new vintages and the kind of charge-off impacts from those, this company has been through years and years of cycles with new vintages. We're very thoughtful in terms of how we do the underwriting. We've got some improvements from the -- within underwriting from the advanced analytic tools that we've put in place. So my sense is a portfolio seasons, we're going to see some increase in charge-offs, but well within the expectations of how we underwrite and well within the expectations of this guidance and the macroeconomic outlook. Operator : And we will take our next question from Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank. Mengxian Jiao : I wanted to follow up with the question on the competitive environment. We've seen a few competitors coming in with new offerings. And I was sort of hoping for some more color as to whether you've seen any read-throughs to possibly yields, possibly tightening or sort of anything else outside of elevated marketing spend with this increase in competition? Roger Hochschild : Yes, great question. In general, the competition takes the form of higher rewards, increased marketing spend. You'll see some players start putting up big onetime signing bonuses as they look to grow. Some players may start extending their promotional periods. But given sort of the inability to reprice cards post CARD Act, you tend not to see it drive yield compression. And as I mentioned earlier, a lot of those products and the competition seems to be targeting that sort of super prime transactor segment, that is not one that we aggressively go after. So our projection for flat cost per account next year reflects our view on our ability to compete in this environment. Mengxian Jiao : And then secondly, John, I wanted to sort of circle back on your comments regarding the difference that you're seeing between higher and lower FICO scores. I mean, are you sort of seeing that in early-stage delinquency sort of diverging? Just any other further details that you might be able to provide in that specific difference. John Greene : Yes. It's in the kind of roll to one, so on delinquent bucket out there. And the fact that we're talking about it is, I'll say, is intended to indicate that we're paying attention to the entire portfolio, and that we have a growing comfort in terms of how the credit outlook is in the performance of the company into '22. Operator : We will take our next question from Bill Ryan with Seaport Research Partners. William Ryan : Just a couple of things, first, on promotional balances. Looking at your portfolio today as a percent of the total, where are you versus kind of like the history of the company or the historic norm, if you will? And what is the typical duration of the promotional balances? And then I'll go ahead and ask the second question, but looked like there's a little bit of a drop in protection product revenue this quarter as a percent of the portfolio. I was just curious if there's any specific call-outs there? John Greene : So the kind of the promotional balance content of the portfolio, we tend not to kind of go into expansive detail about that. So my comments on net interest margins should give an indication that we intend to use that as a tool to help some origination activity. In terms of the protection revenue, so we have an existing product that we stopped marketing some time ago. It\u2019s essentially providing value to the customer set. But if you don't market a tool, obviously, revenue line gets impacted. We have a new product that we launched, very, very soft launch that we actually haven't done any broad marketing yet. So my expectation is that, that line will be flat to down in '22. Eric Wasserstrom : All right, well, Britney, I think we're going to conclude our call here, but thank you all for joining us. And if there's any additional follow-ups, please reach out to us here at Investor Relations. Thank you, and have a great morning. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2022 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. . Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you, Ashley. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s call. I'll begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our fourth quarter earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Green, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, you will be permitted to ask one question, followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. In my comments this morning, I'm going to address three topics, our strategic and financial highlights for the first quarter, the expected impact of the current environment on our 2022 results, and some of the exciting advancements we've made around our DE&I and ESG reporting.  Starting on Slide 3, we had another quarter of outstanding results with earnings of $1.2 billion after tax, or $4.22 per share. Our earnings this quarter was the result of consistent execution on our business priorities against the backdrop of complex economic and geopolitical conditions. Consistent with our expectations, our loan growth accelerated to 8% from the prior year, as we benefited from continued strong sales and investments in new account acquisition last year, and into 2022.  Year-over-year card sales were up 23% with improvement in all categories. There's been a lot of discussion about the impact of energy price inflation on consumer spending. We believe that higher prices at the pump were a relatively small contributor to sales volume, adding approximately 200 basis points to our first quarter volume growth. We also continue to lean into account acquisition, and new accounts grew 11% year-over-year with particular strength in the prime cashback segment, reflecting our attractive value proposition. Credit performance remains strong, with credit losses normalizing in line with our expectations. This is an outgrowth of our consistent focus on prime lending and our strong credit management throughout the pandemic, along with robust labor market conditions. Importantly, we have not seen evidence of credit stress beyond the moderate pace of normalization that we anticipated coming into the year. In fact, as John will address later, we're narrowing our expectations for credit losses to the low end of our prior range.  We continue to effectively manage expenses while making investments for profitable growth, analytic capabilities and product enhancements. As our account growth demonstrates, we're making significant investments in card growth. But we're also focused on innovation in our non-card offerings to further enhance our full suite of digital banking and lending products.  In early April, we launched our cashback debit product. This product is digitally native, including a mobile first customer experience. It provides features like early access to paychecks, as well as items that others will struggle to match including no fees, 1% cashback on debit transactions and our industry leading service. We plan on investing more for the growth of this product with broad market advertising later this year.  Now, let me talk about how we expect the current environment to impact Discover. We provide some views on macro conditions on Slide 4. The most pressing issue is Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Naturally our primary concern is for the resulting humanitarian crisis in the wellbeing of the Ukrainian people as well as for our employees and customers with close ties to this nation. From the more narrow perspective of our business, we currently have no activities in either country. And we do not anticipate any material impacts on our business from the war. We have indefinitely suspended our efforts to open an office in Russia. And while we have temporarily paused our certification of a Diners Club Bank issuing partner in Ukraine, we plan on moving forward as soon as we can.  The war in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions against Russia have also raised concerns about the risk of recession globally and domestically. We do not see any evidence of this across our consumer lending portfolio. Our credit metrics remain good and there is nothing we're seeing in terms of consumer spending or borrowing behavior that suggests that a broader downturn is imminent.  Another concern has been significant elevation and flattening of the yield curve, given the anticipation by the rates market around aggressive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve to stem high inflation. Because we are modestly assets sensitive, the potential for greater number of Fed rate hikes, has improved our outlook for spread income, which John will discuss momentarily. And while we're not immune from the effects of inflation, our business model has somewhat of a natural hedge, as the pressure that inflation may create on elements of our expense structure are partially offset by the contribution inflation makes to our sales volume. In summary, while macro conditions are much more fluid than we had thought coming into this year, we're positioned to benefit from the combination of strong sales and receivables growth, expanding margin, and slowly normalizing credit. These trends give us confidence in our outlook over our forecast horizon.  Finally, I want to point out our new ESG related disclosures. In March, we produced our first Diversity Equity and Inclusion Transparency Report, which highlights our commitment to supporting a diverse workforce that reflects our communities and customers. We also recently published our first ESG summary that includes details on our greenhouse gas emissions among other items. The data in our new reports is encouraging, so we intend to do more to reduce our impact on the environment, and to advance diversity and equity in our organization, and communities.  With that, I'll turn the call over to John to review our financial results in more detail, and provide an update to our expectations for the rest of 2022. John Greene : Thank you, Roger. And good morning, everyone. Once again, our results this quarter reflect strong execution on our business priorities with accelerating loan growth and solid credit performance. I'll begin with our financial summary results on Slide 5. There are a few things I'd like to call out here. The first is that our net income is lower year-over-year because of our reserving actions. In the first quarter of last year, we had an $879 million reserve release, while this quarter included $175 million release. Adjusting for reserve changes, our profit before tax and reserves would have been up 19% year-over-year. Second, our reported total revenue net of interest expense increased $107 million, or 4% from the prior year. However, this included $162 million net loss and equity investments. Excluding this loss, total revenue increased 10%. These points underscore the strength of our core earnings power even in a fluid economic environment.  Let's turn to the details of the quarter. Looking at Slide 6, net interest income was up $149 million or 6% driven by improved net interest margin and higher average receivable. NIM was 10.85%, up 10 basis points from the prior year and four 4 points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in net interest margin reflects lower funding costs and a favorable shift in funding mix partially offset by a higher mix of promotional rate balances. We made further progress on our funding mix with consumer deposits now making up 71% of total funding.  On a sequential basis, the modest increase in NIM was driven by light link improved revolve rate on credit card loans partially offset by increased funding costs. The better revolve rate reflected a 70-basis point decline in the payment rate quarter-over-quarter. This helped boost sequential loan yields by 5 basis points. However, the payment rate remains nearly 500 basis points of pre-pandemic levels. We continue to expect that the normalization in the payment rate will continue through the back half of 2023.  Receivables were higher driven by card, which increased 10% year-over-year from the continued strong sales and robust new account growth last year and into this year. Organic student loans increased 4% reflecting solid originations through the 2021 peak season. Personal loans were down 1% due to a sustained high payment rate.  Looking at other revenue on Slide 7. Excluding the $162 million loss in equity investments, non-interest income increased $120 million, or 26%. This was driven by net discount and interchange revenue, which was up $79 million, or 33%, reflecting strong sales. Sales were up 23% year-over-year with growth across all categories. Inflation drove a modest portion of the growth in the quarter, and we expect that inflation will remain a benefit to sales growth over the short term.  Strong sales also drove higher rewards expense compared to the prior year. However, the rewards rate was down two basis points year-over-year. We still anticipate the full year rewards rate to increase two to four basis points. Loan fee income was up $33 million, or 31%, primarily driven by an increase in late fee instances.  Moving to expenses on Slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $49 million, or 5% year-over-year. Excluding marketing investments, expenses increased just 1%. Compensation expense was slightly down year-over-year on lower bonus accruals and headcount, which was partially offset by higher average salaries. We expect some degree of salary and wage pressure in 2022, and possibly into 2023 as we take steps to remain competitive. Marketing expense increased $38 million, or 25%.  We continue to invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products, including support of our relaunch cashback debit products. Information processing increased $16 million, or 15% year-over-year versus a low level in the period a year ago. This expense was flat sequentially. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize investments in analytics to support growth, innovation, and generate operating efficiencies.  Moving to Slide 9. Net charge-offs remain low and we\u2019re in-line with our expectation for modest credit normalization. Total net charge offs were 1.61%, 87 basis points lower than the prior year and up 24 basis points from last quarter\u2019s record low. Total net charge-off dollars were down $160 million -- $169 million from the prior year and up $55 million sequentially. Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. This quarter, we released $175 million from reserves and our reserve rate continued to decline dropping 17 basis points to 7.1%. The reserve release primarily reflects the sustained strong credit performance in our portfolio, partially offset by loan growth.  Looking at the macroeconomic environment, the pandemic now has a lesser impact on her outlook. The primary sources of risk have shifted to the impacts of inflation and a potential slowdown from Fed actions. While the risk has shifted, the economic view of the U.S. consumer remains healthy. Looking at slide 11. Our common equity tier 1 for the period was 14.7%, slightly lower than the prior period and still well above our 10.5% target. We repurchased $944 million of common stock during the quarter executing on our remaining authorization. Our board of directors also approved a new $4.2 billion share repurchase program that expires on June 30, 2023 and increased our common stock dividend by 20% to $0.60 per share. This repurchase authorization represents our largest ever over a five quarter horizon. It is evidence of our commitment to returning excess capital to shareholders while sustaining our investments in strong organic growth. Concluding on Slide 12. Our outlook for 2022 remains favorable, and we are improving some elements of our expectations. Starting with loans, spending trends through the first quarter and a modest decline in the payment rates improved our conviction for high-single digit growth. We are revising our view on NIM. We now see 5 to 15 basis points of upside for the full year relative to the first quarter. This view includes five Fed rate hikes at 25 basis points each. Our prior view reflected two rate hikes of the same magnitude. If the Fed increases rates beyond this, it would provide modest upside to net interest margin. Despite inflationary pressures, there's no change to our guidance for operating expense. Marketing is expected to be above 2019 levels with non-marketing expenses up low-single digits. We are improving our credit outlook. We expect losses to be between 2.2% and 2.4% for the full year. While there's still some uncertainty about the back half of this year, our current credit performance and delinquency trends give us confidence in a tighter range. And as previously mentioned, our board recently approved a new share repurchase program and increased our dividend. In summary, loan growth accelerated as we benefited from robust sales and strong account acquisitions last year and into 2022. Credit performance reflected our disciplined approach to underwriting and credit management with moderate normalization as expected. We manage operating expenses while investing in new product, features and functionalities. And our highly capital generative model enable us to increase our dividend and share repurchase authorization while supporting strong organic asset growth. These results demonstrate the resiliency and flexibility of our integrated digital banking and payments model. And I'm confident that we are well positioned for continued profitable growth through a range of economic conditions. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for Q&A. Operator :  We'll take our first question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning, Roger and John. Roger Hochschild : Good morning, Bill. Bill Carcache : Competitive intensity and elevated expense pressures are leading your peers to report negative operating leverage. But you just reported over 500 basis points of positive operating leverage and your results certainly stand out. That degree of positive operating leverage was much stronger than I think anyone was expecting. Can you frame for us whether an efficiency ratio here in the 37% range is sustainable? John Greene : Hey, Bill. Thanks for the question. So certainly, we were pleased with the execution in the quarter. In terms of the specifics around efficiency ratio, what we've guided to in the past, and we're still holding there is that over the medium term, we would expect an efficiency ratio in the upper 30s.  Now this quarter certainly demonstrated some progress on that front. There's a bit of timing there. We kept our marketing guidance as we indicated before, which would bring that above 2019 levels. So there's a slight skewing towards the back half of the year. We continue to invest for growth. There will be some upper funnel or broad market advertising as well. We're watching every dollar and making sure we get an appropriate return for our shareholders as we invested whether from an expense standpoint or from a loan lending standpoint.  So I don't want to get over our skis here on that efficiency ratio, strong execution. And we're going to continue to kind of work towards the medium term target. Bill Carcache : Understood. That's helpful. If I may follow up on capital from the 14.7% CET1 level that you're at today, would you expect capital consumed through loan growth and the $4.2 billion authorization that you announced to be enough to get you down to that 10.5% target over the next five quarters? Or would you still expect to be sort of running above 10.5% at that point?  And how much flexibility do you see in that $4.25 billion, is there some chance we could see you take that higher depending on how things play out? John Greene : Yeah. So in terms of the CET1 ratio, we're sticking to a 10.5% target. There is about 175 basis points from CECL transition still yet to impact that CET1 ratio. So then that still puts us over 200 basis points above the target I just expressed.  So our thinking is that over the next two, three, perhaps four years depending on investments and the broad economy to close down to the 10.5% target. But in terms of the repurchase authorization, our board just approved it. So it would be way premature to talk about any changes to that. Bill Carcache : Thank you for taking my questions. John Greene : Of course. Thanks, Bill. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks, good morning. So Roger, you talked about the fluidity of the macro. And obviously, you've been through a number of these cycles as of you, John. I'm just curious, I know you're not seeing anything right now, but what's the playbook from here? I know you guys are leaning into growth, but if things suddenly change, how are you -- how would you react? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. So in terms of lean to growth, I would say we're pleased with our growth but it remains balanced. In terms of the investments we're making, I expect our prime cost per account to be down from last year. So we're not in any way overinvesting.  By enlarge, our credit policies are back to where they were pre-pandemic. But as we said at that time, it was late cycle. So we're not exactly letting credit go. So we're still executing on a model of a disciplined growth even as the economic environment, especially the U.S. consumer remains strong. Sanjay Sakhrani : And I guess maybe just following up on interest rate sensitivity. John, could you just talk about what you're seeing? I know you raised the NIM expectations, but any changes in sort of industry behavior around chasing rates from competitor banks and such? Maybe you could just talk about deposit beta. Thanks. John Greene : Yeah. Sure, Sanjay. So in terms of competitor behavior. So we have seen the competitor set that we benchmark ourselves against recently through this quarter, this past quarter increased rates and into this quarter. As you observed our behavior in the pandemic, we moved fairly aggressively down. As a matter of fact, we led our competitive set on the interest rate movements downward.  Now that we're in a rising rate environment. My expectation is we're going to be disciplined around that. So the principles are that we want to ensure we have a fair customer proposition. We also seek to kind of manage our interest costs as effectively as we can. So a combination of funding needs and competitive dynamics will dictate how we -- how and when we take deposit pricing actions. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. I guess I was hoping for -- Roger, if you could talk a little bit about the competitive environment. Obviously, there's been a lot going on from some of your competitors. You talked about an 11% kind of growth in new accounts and your marketing expense was pretty much under control. So can you just talk about what it is that allows you to kind of do that and be comfortable in terms of your account growth going forward? Roger Hochschild : Sure. Thanks, Moshe. I think it really comes down to having a balanced and distinctive value proposition. The Discover brand is one of the most trusted brands in financial services. We provide a leading customer experience, both through the phone and digitally, which helps with retention as well as booking new accounts. We spent a long time building our skills around managing cash rewards, not just paying the higher rate but focused on every part of the process. And then continuing to innovate with new features and functionality, and you saw we just launched another one around helping protect your information from people reselling it on the web.  And so that I think, allows us to succeed in just about any environment. I view the card business is always competitive. Occasionally, there's a lull in the depths of a recession. But beyond that, it's our job to execute for our owners and grow. And you're seeing that this quarter, and I'm confident we'll be able to keep it going. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up in a completely different direction, and that is you talked about the debit product. Can you just talk a little bit more about how much in resources you're putting behind that, how big it could be? And are there any other areas in which you can kind of leverage the network in the coming year? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Sure. So the network does give us advantages for both our credit card issuing business, but also in terms of being able to support the 1% cashback on debit purchases, which is a real differentiator in the marketplace and builds on the Discover heritage with cashback in a new direction. So we'll work our way into it. As John mentioned, we'll start broad market advertising for that product later this year. But we intend to sort of scale it gradually and build for the long-term. Overtime, we expect it to be a key part of our business.  And then we see advantages on our core card issuing business. Good example is our ability as we rollout SRC to pre-enroll our customers in a way that will be much more challenging for issuers on a third-party network. And finally, we remain focused on the payment services business. Monetizing our network investments through attracting third-party volume. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Roger Hochschild : Good morning, Bet. John Greene : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Nice growth in the quarter and a really nice pickup as we moved into end of period here. And I just wanted to get a sense as to how you're thinking about funding that continued strong growth as we move through the year given that you've got fed string the balance sheet and probably some deposits growth slow down. I looked at the liquidity balances, it looks like they're down to pre-pandemic lows, which -- well, during the pandemic, I should say. So I'm just thinking through deposit growth versus liquidity utilization versus wholesale funding, how should we think about how you're planning on ending the loan growth? Thanks. John Greene : Yeah. Great. Thanks, Betsy. So in terms of loan growth, we're going to take a balanced approach. So we talked about the target of 70% to 80% of our funding needs coming from OSA or deposits from our customer base. There's always the opportunity to go into the market and execute on broker CDs if liquidity needs to dictate that. We also issued an ABS transaction this past quarter at -- in a rising rate environment at pretty compelling rates overall.  So we're going to take that balanced approach. And you will see or we did -- if you haven't seen it, you'll see a little bit more of it. There'll be a little bit more broad market marketing on deposits and then also targeted marketing on deposits. And we're going to try to balance kind of the rate and the marketing in order to get the most effective cost of funds as we can. So that's essentially the strategy in a nutshell.  So we actually just went through a review from the Fed on our liquidity controls, and it's come out very, very strong. So we're pleased with the position of the business and the processes around it. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, you indicated, I think earlier, John, that the outlook that you have for NIM includes five rate hikes from the Fed. And maybe you could help us understand as we go to that six, seven, eight, nine rate hike that's expected. How does that -- how does your asset sensitivity change, if at all? Or should we just take what's in the 10-Q and apply that to whatever comes after Fed rate hike five? John Greene : Yeah. So the math on it would be for a 25 basis point increase somewhere between 3 and 5 bps to NIM on an annual basis. Now there's a bunch of other dynamics that obviously impact that, right? So you touched upon it earlier. So deposit pricing could impact that as well as the revolve rate, payment rate and then the credit impacts coming through net interest margin.  So a lot of dynamics there, and that was why we were conservative in terms of the number of hikes that we baked into this updated guidance. If there are more hikes and we're able to kind of effectively manage our liquidity, credit remains as we expect we would certainly see some upside from that guidance we provided. Betsy Graseck : But in the same like 3 to 5 bp range per 25? John Greene : Yes. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. Thanks. John Greene : And that's an annual basis. Betsy Graseck : Yeah. I got that. Thanks, John. John Greene : You got it. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. As a follow-up to, I think it was Sanjay's question earlier just around deposit beta. Could you just tell us, do you -- what is your deposit beta assumption that's baked into your NIM guidance that you just mentioned? John Greene : Yeah. So thanks, John. So I don't really kind of think about this in terms of the deposit beta. What I do here is think about it in terms of broad principles. So the principles are that we're going to have an attractive proposition for our customers, and then we're going to manage interest costs as low as we can, while still maintaining that proposition I just talked about.  So I gave the point in terms of our actions during the pandemic when we had plenty of liquidity that we were a price leader down. And what I said in this rising rate environment, we expect that we're going to manage that interest costs very, very tightly in order to hopefully drive overall cost low, increase NIM and benefit shareholders. So I don't want to kind of tag to a specific beta because they tend to be -- the numbers tend to be kind of off a month from now. John Pancari : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then separately, just regarding the broader economic backdrop, given the Fed's efforts here to tame inflation and slow the economy and then it looks like this morning, we're getting a probably a disappointing print here on GDP. I'm curious, does your 2022 outlook factor in a slowdown in card spend at all? John Greene : It does. So actually, it's the 23% for the quarter was higher than we anticipated. We're frankly happy to see that. But there is a modest stepping down through this year. Effectively, it's hard to envision year-over-year kind of sales growth to continue in the upper 20s. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning, guys. John Greene : Good morning. Ryan Nash : John, maybe to follow up on a couple of the questions that have been asked. I think the focus has been on the liability side of the balance sheet as it pertains to rate sensitivity, but maybe we could talk a little bit about the asset side. I'm just curious, obviously, a lot has changed over the last few years. So maybe can you unpack a little bit for us have we seen significant changes in terms of floating rates relative to the last time rates rose? How much more improvement do you think we could see in revolve rates? And I guess, lastly, are we now back to more sustainable BT level such that we can see the asset yields improving with benchmark rates? I have a follow-up. John Greene : Okay. Thanks, Ryan. So there's a lot there. So revolve rate actually increased mildly in the quarter as the payment rate decreased by the 70 basis points that I spoke about. And by the way, that payment rate decline was essentially in-line with how we built our original guidance.  So as we think about inflation or other impacts that could drive payment rate lower, we've essentially derisked our guidance for loan growth. So we could see additional upside subject to payment rate and a bunch of other factors. The other pieces there in terms of kind of overall asset growth, what I would do is I would break it down into kind of the three categories or primary products. So card, you saw the double-digit growth there. Student loans at 4%, so we'll have another peak origination season coming in 2022. We hope to be able to execute there and continue to take market share. And personal loans, the growth was down 1%, but originations were up strong double digits. So we had a high payment rate impacting personal loans that we'll expect to moderate over time, given some level of loan growth in that product. So I guess your question had a number of elements. Hopefully, I'll give you enough detail to be able to lease together the information you're trying to glean. Ryan Nash : Yep. And maybe as a follow-up on credit. It was good to see you lowering the high-end of the range. And I understand you probably have about six months of visibility, so the fourth quarter is probably still hard to predict. But just looking at some of the credit metrics, delinquencies remained really, really benign, they're only up 20 basis points on the bottom. So can you maybe just talk about what's included now in the credit expectations? And do we have the potential to see credit come in towards the bottom end of the range over the course of the year? Thanks. John Greene : Yeah. So when we gave this initial guidance, we gave a pretty broad range, and we added around internally whether or not tightened it. And as the quarter unfolded, our conviction around that tighter range and perhaps the lower end group. So as you said, there's three months. The fourth quarter, we don't have perfect visibility in terms of kind of roll rate performance. But our modeling analytics have been actually surprisingly accurate and we have a high expectation there.  So we'll see how the rest of this quarter plays out. And hopefully, we can give updated guidance in a subsequent call. Ryan Nash : Thanks, John. Operator : And we will take our next question from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mark DeVries : Thank you. So your reserve rate is still about 100 basis points above CECL day one. Can you just talk about what assumptions are embedded in that? How we should think about that ratio of recession happens in the near term as some are expecting? I mean it would seem these levels that's almost already in the reserve. And alternatively, where could it go if some of this macro uncertainty clears? John Greene : Right. Thanks, Mark. So yeah, the reserve rate came in at 7.1% CECL, day one was 6.1%. So some context around CECL day one. So it was an accounting adjustment reflecting new guidance provided by the FASB, right? So we did our best to capture life of loan estimates of what losses would be and embed them in over reserve rate.  Now the macro environment at the time today has certainly changed. Portfolio dynamics have changed. As a matter of fact, the upper end of our kind of credit quality for the balance sheet is stronger than it was CECL day one. But there's still a degree of uncertainty that we are managing through. So as we've said in prior quarters, we're conservative on this. We want to make sure that we're appropriately capturing reserve rates under GAAP.  And if the broad macros are positive and the portfolio performance is positive, we could continue to step down through a combination of growth or reserve releases. And if the recession likelihood continues to increase, the broad macros could warrant either holding or perhaps even increasing. But overall, I think the takeaway here should be, Mark that the portfolio performance is really, really strong. There's no view of any damage to the consumer. There's no view that job losses are going to increase in the -- definitely through this year and likely through the first half of next year. So all those factors are positive from a credit and reserving standpoint. Mark DeVries : Okay. Got it. And then just a clarifying question on the OpEx guidance. You indicated no change there despite what seemed like kind of growing wage inflation pressures that you've indicated you're not immune to. Should we assume that as that pressure kind of builds in the second half, that what happens as you flex down kind of other non-marketing non-wage expense to maintain some kind of a targeted operating leverage? John Greene : Yeah. So here's how we think about it. So -- and I've tried to articulate this over the past two and half years. We're going to be really disciplined in terms of how we spend our dollars. And Discover has got a long history of that. We've done some stuff to kind of drive both accountability and visibility of the expense base, which my sense is it has helped. It's important to note that as we see opportunities, we're going to continue to invest. We also are -- as you paraphrased, we're seeing inflation coming in on salary and wages. We're also seeing it in our third-party spend. So we will effectively manage that in order to be able to deliver to the guidance we provided. And if we see incremental opportunity either for growth or otherwise, we'll invest to -- and we'll create transparency on that in order to drive long-term shareholder returns. Mark DeVries : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kevin Barker : Thank you. When you consider this rate environment versus the last rate cycle, do you feel that the deposit betas that are going to play out in this cycle are going to mirror what we saw in the last cycle? And is that your base case, when you think about funding costs despite what might be a much more aggressive Fed this time around? John Greene : Yeah. Last time, I would take out as a proxy, but there's a couple of things that are different, right? So the pace of inflation is a heck of a lot higher here. We're at record levels of inflation. The other thing that is different is the savings rate coming into this inflationary cycle, much higher. So those two dynamics could create some offsetting impacts. But it will be subject to kind of liquidity and loan growth across the industry and who's got a competitive proposition. And we're very comfortable with our proposition in terms of the customer experience, the kind of the rate. And if you take a look at our rate versus a brick-and-mortar bank, I could find it ironic that anybody keeps any excess cash in those institutions whatsoever. So we're going to be diligent on it. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then you mentioned that you're very disciplined on how you spend your dollars. You're pretty consistent on that commentary. Are you seeing anywhere where some of your competition may be a little exuberant in how they're spending in dollars just given the opportunity set in the market today? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. I would say, in general, in this business, you get diminishing returns on incremental investments in marketing. And so you have seen cycles in the past where people spend heavily after a while they look at the returns they got and maybe less happy with that. So we feel good about both what we're investing on the rewards side and the guidance we provide there of only 2 to 4 basis point increase. But also that we'll see cost per accounts at an attractive level. You're certainly seeing very heavy levels of investment out there that I would wonder whether or not they're going to be sustainable. Kevin Barker : Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : And we'll go next to Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Don Fandetti : Yes. Good morning. I know home equity is a small part of your business, but I didn't know if there was maybe a growing opportunity as a lot of the sort of cash out refi activity could potentially slow?  And then secondly, I think you have a partnership on account-to-account payments. I was just curious if you think that will take off a point of sale in the United States? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. So in terms of our home equity business, we do think a rising rate environment will be very constructive. Perversely, many households, their greatest asset could be their 3% mortgage. So while we're excited about it, it also isn't that huge.  On the payment side, we're excited about our partnership, but I don't see tremendous disruption coming to a point of sale and existing means of payment point of sale anytime soon. But we're excited to work with a broad range of partners and different fintechs who want to leverage our network capabilities. Don Fandetti : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rick Shane : Thanks everybody for taking my question this morning. Can you talk a little bit behaviorally about the stratification you're seeing in terms of borrower behavior, both in terms of credit performance and also in terms of spending behavior, discretionary versus non-discretionary ships across the portfolio? Roger Hochschild : Sure. Seeing strength across all categories. Revolver sales growth is probably a little higher than transactors growth, but that reflects our lend-focused model. But -- and that sales strength is continuing into April, where through, say, the 24 sales are still up 23% year-over-year. So consumer is good and breadth across all categories. In terms of different segments, from a credit standpoint, you do tend to see normalization occur faster at the lower end segments. But again, we're very pleased, and John mentioned that in his comments that the normalization is very much in-line with our expectations. Rick Shane : Got it. And Roger, are you seeing any in that lower FICO band, any shift in terms of spending behavior from category to category? Roger Hochschild : Not necessarily. There's been a lot of volatility just as pandemic restrictions come and go, certainly, travel growth is up compared to what it was. But I'd really point towards breadth and growth and spend across all categories. Rick Shane : Great. Thank you very much, guys. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Robert Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Robert Napoli : Thank you. Good morning. And congratulations. A really good quarter. I mean, Discover has been a model of consistency over the last decade plus, so it's just good to see.  Just on your cashback debit product, just thoughts on the growth of that business, the penetration rate? Any comments on some of the other banking like products in early paycheck, what kind of demand you're seeing for that product? And then economically, how you're going to monetize these banking products overtime? Roger Hochschild : Sure. It's still early days. So I probably won't provide much in the way of forecast, but we're very excited about the demand we're seeing. We think the product is positioned well to compete both with some of the newer fintech, neobanks but also with any traditional branch player that's out there. And overtime, the balances build slowly, but a lot of opportunities to cross-sell both other deposit products such as savings accounts and CDs, but also our broad range of card products and provide really a different entry point into the Discover franchise.  So our very much our focus is on building this for the long term. And as we said earlier, you'll start seeing more broad market advertising later this year for that product. Robert Napoli : Great. And then just any thoughts, Roger, on the competitive positioning of Discover today versus, say, five years ago, pre-pandemic five years ago, your ability to maintain or gain share while maintaining returns. I mean you've done so very nicely. But just any thoughts on the competitive position today versus, say, five years ago? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. I mean, I'd go back to the very kind comments you made at the beginning around 10 years of consistency. Even five years ago, a brand value proposition that's for trust, for a superior customer experience and for innovation on the feature side. Back then, it might have been the ability to freeze your card, now it's some of the things we do for our customers in terms of protecting their information online, but the focus remains the same. A very strong cash rewards program that competes well with anything out there.  You\u2019re pricing a little more intensity in the cash rewards space as some of the changes on miles programs through the pandemic. But we still compete very much the same way, but also still feel as good about our competitive position. Robert Napoli : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mihir Bhatia : Good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. Obviously really solid results here this quarter. So I guess some congratulations on that. But maybe to -- maybe you could just talk a little bit about Washington. Were you hearing more noise out of from there, both from the CFPB on the late season, which I guess, to a certain extent, kind of plays into your brand, about less fees and being consumer-friendly. But still, obviously, will have an impact for you to the extent I think yesterday, he announced or this week you announced he's talking about reopening the card act and the fees there. But also just on the student loan forgiveness side too, hearing more rumblings on that. So just what's going on with Washington your views on the situation? Thank you. Roger Hochschild : Yeah. Sure. So on the fee side, first, I'd say we have good relationships and enjoyed working closely with all of our regulators and by enlarge, are aligned in terms of wanting the consumers to be protected.  As you've seen, it's a pretty small percent of our revenues. We waived the first late fee for our Discover customers anyway. Right now, we're set at the safe harbor to the extent that, that changes we can change accordingly. But don't expect it to have an overly material impact.  Certainly, on the deposit side, the fact that we have no fees on any of our deposit products, positions us very, very well compared to our competitors. And it's a key part of our value proposition. In terms of student loans, we probably have seen some pressure on the payment rate just given the ongoing payment holidays that people have seen on their federal loan. It's important to realize that there's a big difference between the federal loan program and ours just in terms of who they give loans to, the types of educations they fund. As an example, we do nothing in the four-profit sector.  So yeah, we'll wait and see what comes out of Washington, but we don't expect it to be overly disruptive for our own student loan business. Mihir Bhatia : Got it. Thank you. And then just turning back to credit for a second. Obviously, you're improving the outlook for this year. But -- how much of that is just a function of you gaining increased confidence based on the 1Q outperformance maybe versus any kind of change? I guess really what I'm trying to understand is, is the path to normalization changing? Or is the curve like from here like a little less steep than what you had maybe expected it to be -- like when do we get back to a normalized state? Is it the front half of 2023, the back half of 2023-2024? John Greene : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mihir. While we said previously as we expected normalization through 2023. Now it's really hard to kind of predict anything when you get out, out in the kind of 2024 timeframe. What I would say here is in terms of narrowing the range that was a function largely of increased confidence around our forecast with, frankly, an internal expectation that we're going to come in at the lower end of the range. So we're still giving ourselves some wiggle room here. But if things proceed as we expect them to, we'll be around the lower end of the range. Mihir Bhatia : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Hecht : Thanks, guys. Most of my questions have been asked. But I guess -- turning to the student lending business. I mean it's important. I know it's small but important overall. But your results have been pretty consistent there, but I'm wondering maybe if you just have any thoughts on the moratorium, its impact on your business. And more importantly, when the moratorium expires, is there any broader effect that you would expect to see on overall credit trends even outside that specific segment? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. We've modeled it pretty carefully. We don't expect it to have a significant impact on card or personal loans. And as you think about student loans, it's important to look at how we underwrite those. For our undergrad loans, the vast majority are cosigned by the parent, very strong FICO scores. So we've seen probably a modest benefit on the credit side, but also a modest negative on the payment rate as students have more liquidity to put towards paying off their private student loans.  And again, I'd go back to the federal student loan program in terms of who participates, the amount of debt they have and the nature of the education they finance is dramatically different than our portfolio. John Hecht : Okay. Make sense. Thanks. Operator : And we will take our last question from Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Meng Jiao : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick question on the personal loan portfolio. I guess are you sort of tightening standards there just given the pristine early stage and loss rates that we've seen there. But I'm also looking at the sequential sort of seven-quarter decline in yield. So just wanted to get your thoughts there? Or is it just sort of primarily the elevated payment rates that's driving that? Thank you. John Greene : Yeah, it's a couple of factors that are playing out here. So the first piece was when we came in -- prior to coming into the pandemic, we were pretty tight. And then we hit the pandemic and we tightened the personal loan product more stringently than any other product we had. And then we also we doubled down on our underwriting, including 100% verification of all loans. So we were super careful. That had an impact on growth levels. We have since reduced our manual underwriting. So it's back to kind of pre-pandemic underwriting standards. And we also opened up the credit box because what we are seeing is the loans that were in there were pristine. And we're now in a situation where we've got a high returning asset. We're looking at the competitive dynamics. We've made some conscious choice to reduce yield for the benefit of very profitable growth.  And as I said earlier in my comments, the expectation is that the payment rate will subside, and we'll see growth in loan balances in that product. Originations have been positively strong, as I said earlier as well. Roger Hochschild : Great. Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions. Roger Hochschild : Great. Thank you, Ashley. And with that, I think we'll conclude. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to follow up here in Investor Relations. And have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Arren Cyganovich - Citi: Operator : Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter 2022 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you, Katie, and welcome, everyone, to this morning's call. I'll begin on slide two of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our second quarter earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, you'll be permitted to ask one question followed by one follow-up question. After a follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks Eric and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'm very pleased with our results this quarter. We generated robust revenue growth and strong earnings, while advancing several strategic initiatives. This solid performance reflects the strength of our integrated digital banking and payments model and our focus on managing the business, while investing for growth amidst an increasingly fluid macroeconomic backdrop. Let's turn to the summary on slide three. For the second quarter, we reported net income of $1.1 billion after-tax or $3.96 per share. Our operating metrics in the second quarter remained very strong. Loan growth increased by 13% from the prior year, driven by a combination of higher sales and strong new account growth and our asset quality remains solid across all products, reflecting our focus on prime lending and our approach to underwriting and credit management. We also advanced several strategic priorities in the quarter. In our Payment Services segment, we continue to expand our global acceptance through new partnerships. In June, we announced a network alliance in Italy with BANCOMAT, one of Europe's largest payment networks. This should provide our customers with access to merchants in Italy through BANCOMAT's extensive acquirer relationships. This partnership represents a significant advancement in our acceptance across Western Europe and we remain committed to expanding our international merchant coverage. In our Digital Banking segment, our combination of industry-leading customer service and compelling products continues to differentiate us in the marketplace. We were recently awarded the highest ranking in customer satisfaction by J.D. Power among mobile, credit card apps, and websites. We also achieved J.D. Power's top customer satisfaction and checking accounts for direct retail banks. This recognition underscores our customer service model, which combined with our compelling Cashback rewards and no fee products, create a value proposition that we believe others will struggle to match. For this reason, we're confident that we are well-positioned to generate substantial growth and shareholder value over the long-term. Notwithstanding our strong performance, we continue to closely monitor today's evolving economic environment.  Slide four provides some views on the current macro conditions. Measures of inflation remain persistently high and the Federal Reserve has signaled its intent to address this through restrictive monetary policy. Our business model has somewhat of a natural hedge against inflation as higher expenses are largely offset by the contribution inflation makes to our sales volumes and because our balance sheet is moderately asset sensitive, rate hikes improve our outlook for spread income, despite driving higher funding costs.  Perhaps more significantly, tighter monetary policy may have raised the risk of an economic recession, but behavior and trends from our consumer loan portfolio currently do not suggest that a downturn is imminent. Our credit metrics remain strong and sales are robust even as our customers maintain high payment rates. Similarly, most labor market measures indicate employment conditions remain broadly supportive of consumer financial health and credit performance. Nonetheless, should there be changes in macroeconomic conditions, we will make the appropriate adjustments. Our through-the-cycle underwriting considers all stages of a credit cycle including downturns. And our history of conservative credit management positions us well for any future periods of economic stress. Our actions during the recent pandemic are a good example of how nimbly we can respond to changing circumstances. We also maintain a strong balance sheet and capital position. Our current level of common equity Tier 1 is 14.2%, well above our internal target and regulatory minimums. And as John will detail, our reserves capture our estimate of losses over the expected life of our loan portfolio.  This brings me to one topic about which we want to make you aware, as we addressed in our press release, we are temporarily suspending our share repurchase program in light of an internal investigation being conducted by a Board appointed independent special committee. This investigation concerns our student loan servicing practices and related compliance matters. And while we cannot comment further at this time, I can say, this matter was contemplated as John reaffirms our expense guidance for the year. In summary, while macroeconomic conditions remain somewhat uncertain, we continue to advance our strategic goals and are benefiting from the combination of strong sales and receivables growth, expanding margin and slowly normalizing credit. These trends give us confidence in our outlook over the forecast horizon, while our reserves and high level of capital position us to withstand a range of macroeconomic environments.  I'll now turn the call over to John to review key aspects of our financial results in more detail. John Greene : Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary results on Slide five. As Roger indicated, we reported net income of $1.1 billion, which was 35% lower year-over-year. However, I'd like to call out two items. The first is that in the second quarter of last year, we had a $729 million unrealized gain on our equity investments compared to a $42 million loss this quarter. Adjusting for these, our earnings would have been $4.07 per share in the current quarter.  Second, the provision for credit losses increased from the prior year due to a $110 million reserve build in the current quarter compared to a $321 million reserve release in the prior year. The current quarter reserve build was primarily driven by higher loan receivables. Excluding the impact of these two items, our profit before tax and reserves would have been up 38% year-over-year. Moving to Slide 6. Net interest income was up $311 million or 14%, driven by higher average receivables and improved net interest margin. NIM was 10.94%, up 26 basis points from the prior year and 9 basis points sequentially. On both a year-over-year and sequential basis, the increase in net interest margin reflects the higher prime rate and favorable funding mix, partially offset by increased promotional balances and higher funding costs. Receivable growth was driven by card, which increased 15% year-over-year from strong sales and robust new account growth last year and into this year. In the quarter, the payment rate increased 40 basis points and remains more than 500 basis points above the pre-pandemic level. We continue to expect that the normalization in payment rate will be modest this year and will continue through the back half of 2023. Organic student loans increased 4%, reflecting solid growth in originations. Personal loans were up 4%, reflecting a return to growth. We view this as a validation of our approach to marketing, underwriting and pricing of this product over the past several quarters, and we believe we are competitively positioned to grow, particularly relative to some non-bank originators. In terms of funding mix, our customer deposit balances were flat year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Increases in our savings balances offset the run-off in higher-cost CDs. Our strong asset growth may cause deposits to vary as a proportion of our funding mix, but we continue to target 70% to 80% deposit funding over the medium term. Looking at other revenue on Slide 7. Excluding the impacts of equity investments detailed earlier, non-interest income increased $105 million or 19%. This was driven by higher net discount and interchange revenue, which was up $51 million or 15%, reflecting strong sales and favorable sales mix, partially offset by higher rewards. Sales were up 18% year-over-year with growth across most categories. For the first half of the year, our sales growth was 20%. We estimate that inflation contributed between 200 and 300 basis points to this figure. Strong sales also drove higher rewards expense compared to the prior year. Our rewards rate increased 6 basis points year-over-year, reflecting two factors : our standard 5% category aligning with customer needs included gas this quarter. Second, the substantial growth in new accounts over the past year increased the cost of our cash-back match. However, on a sequential basis, the reward rate was up 1 basis point and up 3 basis points through the first half of the year. This is consistent with our expectations of 2 to 4 basis points of annual rewards cost increases. Loan fee income was up $37 million or 35%, primarily driven by an increase in late fee instances. Moving to expenses on Slide 8. Total operating expenses were flat year-over-year and up 8% from the prior quarter. Compensation costs were up slightly year-over-year, primarily due to increased headcount and higher average salaries. Like many organizations, we are seeing salary in wage pressure, which will likely continue through the balance of this year and into next year. Marketing expenses increased $79 million or 45% as we continue to invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products. We grew new card accounts by 39% from last year's second quarter. This speaks to the strength of our brand, the relevance of our value proposition, and the benefits of our investments in targeting analytics. As Roger discussed, we closely track economic and competitive conditions, and we remain disciplined about our through-the-cycle approach to underwriting. This approach contributes to our confidence about investing in brand and acquisition. Moving to credit performance on slide nine. Net charge-offs remain low and were in line with expectations for continued credit normalization. Total net charge-offs were 1.8%, 32 basis points lower than the prior year and up 19 basis points from the prior quarter. Total net charge-off dollars were down $27 million from the prior year and up $61 million sequentially. In the card portfolio, the net charge-off rate increased 17 basis points sequentially or $5 0 million. Looking at our receivables, we are not seeing evidence of emerging credit stress at this point. Our delinquencies are virtually unchanged from the first quarter. And while we expect some increases in delinquencies over the back half, this is consistent with our outlook for steady credit normalization into 2023. Turning to the discussion of our allowance on slide 10. This past quarter, we increased our allowance by $110 million, largely due to higher receivable balances. Our reserve rate continued to decline, however, dropping 31 basis points to 6.8%. As a reminder, our reserves are based on our expectation of life of loan losses. On the macroeconomic view, we believe the balance of risk has shifted to include the potential for an economic slowdown resulting from Fed policy actions. For us, the most significant driver of loss is changes to employment conditions. As Roger mentioned, current labor -- the current labor market conditions remained healthy. And as examples, the number of job openings still exceeds the number of unemployed people and the unemployment rate remains low, but unemployment claims have started to creep up. As part of our reserving process, we consider the prospects of higher unemployment and a range of macroeconomic scenarios. Looking at slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 14.2%, well above our 10.5% target. The strength of our capital position is underscored by the recent CCAR's regulatory stress test. Based on the CCAR's results, our preliminary stress capital buffer should decrease by 110 basis points, which effectively lowers our minimum required CET1 ratio to 7%, the lowest possible ratio. We repurchased $601 million of common stock during the quarter and declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.60 per share. Concluding on slide 12. As we look into the back half of this year, our perspectives for 2022 remains favorable. We are improving some elements of our expectations. We are revising our view on loan growth to low teens, continued strong sales and new account acquisitions through the second quarter support our confidence in this outlook. There is no change to our view on NIM. We continue to see 5 to 15 basis points of upside for the full year relative to the first quarter level of 10.85%. Our expectations for expenses remain at mid-single-digit growth versus last year. We still expect marketing costs to come in above 2019 levels, with non-marketing expenses to increase by low single-digits. We are improving our credit outlook. We now expect net charge-offs to be between 1.9% and 2.1% for the full year and we intend to return to share repurchases at an appropriate time in the future. In summary, loan growth accelerated as we benefited from robust sales and strong account acquisition. Credit performance remained solid, reflecting our disciplined approach to underwriting and credit management. We manage operating expenses while investing in new account acquisition, brand and digital capabilities and our balance sheet and capital position are strong. The results demonstrate the resiliency of our integrated digital banking and payments model, and I'm confident that we are well positioned for continued profitable growth through a range of economic conditions. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Katie, to open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you.  Thank you. Our first question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks and really strong results in terms of accounts and loan growth. And maybe, Roger, could you just talk a little more detail about kind of as you see the competitive environment, you're adding a lot of accounts. I know you've talked about how you kind of originate them with a through-the-cycle approach. But just talk a little bit about both how you see the competitive environment and how you see what's your -- any kind of tweaks you are making because of the current environment? And talk about that in terms of the outlook. Thanks so much. Roger Hochschild : Sure, Moshe. Thanks for the question. I would say the competitive environment remains intense with the consumers staying strong. We are seeing strong levels of marketing from most of our prime competitors, but I think our differentiated value proposition is succeeding well in the marketplace across all of our products. From a credit standpoint, I would say we're roughly back to where we were pre-pandemic. But keep in mind, that's sort of a late cycle approach that we had towards the end of 2019. So we think we remain conservative on credit, but the differentiation for the brand and the product are really working well to drive growth even in this competitive environment. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, again on the student loan side, given that this is the key quarter coming up in terms of originations. Last quarter, you talked a little bit about how you expected to have some advantages versus market funded players. Obviously, there's -- you've got the issue that you've got from a compliance standpoint. You talked about how that could impact you from an origination standpoint and if that does, how long that could last? Roger Hochschild : Yes. We are moving forward with our plans for peak season. Again, what has been a wild card over the last couple of years has been sort of overall number of kids going back to school and their demands for funding. So, I think that the market size is always a bit uncertain. But we feel good about how prepared we are as we move into the peak origination months. Moshe Orenbuch : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning, Roger and John. You guys certainly have historically remain profitable through the cycle with risk-adjusted yields remaining quite strong even in a deep recession like we saw in \u00e2\u0080\u009908. And it makes sense that you're continuing to invest here against the backup that we're in. But could you maybe frame for us, what it would take to curb your appetite for investing for growth? And maybe just, what it would take for you to have a pullback? Roger Hochschild : Yes. Thanks for the question. So, there are a whole series of things we carefully monitor in terms of the health of our customers and portfolio, and that goes into our appetite for growth. I would say part of the things we watch most carefully externally are the job market and rising unemployment. And so, we have a finely tuned playbook in terms of how we'll adjust originations? But we continue to originate throughout the cycle. And so even during the financial crisis that you referred to, we kept up a certain level of account production even as we became more conserve in credit. In our underwriting always uses a through-the-cycle approach as we think about the profitability of accounts, we're booking. So those are some of the things we'd look at. Bill Carcache : Thank you and if I may follow up on that. Maybe could you also frame how you're thinking about the risk that -- the strength that we're seeing in the consumer and labor markets is in and of itself inflationary and could leave the Fed to have to do more and since we know that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, the increases in unemployment that follow those Fed hikes, tend to be quite lagged. And so those effects could take some time to show up.  Maybe can you just speak to that dynamic, how that feeds, if that feeds in any way into your reserving models. We haven't had a significant inflation cycle in a long time. And so, there are some concerns that current underwriting models may not be picking that up, would love to hear your thoughts on that? Thank you. John Greene : Yes. Hey Bill, I'll take that one. Good question. We spent plenty of time thinking about it. So, inflation unto itself is not correlated to loan losses based on all the historical data we've looked at. Now certainly, we've seen some changes in consumer behavior. So, we'll keep an eye on it. But typically, it would be unemployment or changes in employment levels overall. I have a particular view that as we try or the Fed tries to deal with the inflation situation, certainly it's going to be quite a period of time before the job market is directly impacted in a significant way. So, unemployment remains super low, so 3.5%, there's still about 11.3 million job openings right now versus 6 million people looking for jobs. Spending remains robust. And credit is performing very, very well. So, as we look at those factors, we're going to keep an eye and see if there's any material changes on that. But in terms of reserving at this point, that that life of loan approach that we take, looking at broad macros as well as portfolio performance gave us confidence in the reserving levels we chose and the corresponding reduction in the reserve rate. So, we'll keep an eye on it and update it quarterly. Bill Carcache : That's very helpful. Thank you, Roger, John. appreciate it. . Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. I guess my first question is on the share repurchase suspension. Obviously, that decision was probably not something that was taken lightly. Could you just talk about the thought process in making that decision, given all the positive news on your excess capital and stress capital buffers and such. I mean should we infer that the size and scope of damages could be pretty significant? Roger Hochschild : Thanks for the question, Sanjay. I think I tried to address that when I said our expense guidance that John reaffirmed includes our views on this matter. So, there are many factors that go into a share repurchase program. It's not just potential financial exposure. So -- and I would say, returning our shareholders' capital in the form of the repurchase has been a big focus for management and the Board and will continue to do. And that's why John said we hope to get back to the repurchase program as soon as we are able. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. And then, I guess, a question for John, just on NIM. Obviously, I think like the Fed's posture has moved towards more rate hikes. I'm just curious your NIM expectation is sort of unchanged. But maybe you could just talk about what went into that and if you're seeing any changes in deposit betas? John Greene : Yes. Thanks Sanjay. So, the NIM guidance gave a range of benchmarking off the 10.85%, and we said five to 15 basis points range of upside from that. Based on the Fed actions to-date, we're tracking towards the upper end of that guidance range at this point. So, that's a positive. We are seeing deposit costs increase and that's a function of two things. The competitive environment and then also the fact that we had record loan growth in the quarter at 13%. So, the funding mix, as I said in my prepared remarks, that will likely change in the back half of the year. And we're going to continue to focus on that 70%, 80%. So, competitively, we're not going to lead certainly in terms of deposit pricing, but we're going to respond to ensure we remain very competitive and have a proposition -- a strong value proposition for our customers. So, how that translates into betas, it's hard to call right now. But I would say the first part of the year, we had a very, very low beta. I would expect that to normalize as the funding environment migrates. Sanjay Sakhrani : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Rick Shane : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. When we look back at some of the changes over the years like the promulgation of the CARD Act, there were impacts that people thought would be cyclical that became secular in terms of loss rates, in terms of yields. I'm wondering when we look at payment rates today, if there's something that you guys might see that suggest that this is more of a secular change than a cyclical change. John Greene : Yes. Thanks, Rick. So -- yes. It's hard to call it right now. But we do have some preliminary data that shows that the decrease in the use of cash and the touchless transactions you may do at Starbucks or other institutions where folks previously would use cash. A lot of that's gone away. So it's creating a higher level of transactions through our card. Good thing for us from an interchange perspective, but also that cash that folks used to expend, I believe there's some portion of it that is now going to pay down balances which is increasing the payment rate. Now -- how much is that? It's hard to call right now. We're about 500 basis points higher than the pre-pandemic level. If I were to ask to give a range, I would say maybe 100 to 200 basis points of that could be a permanent change. And then the rest has to do with the strength of the portfolio and the strength of the consumers. Rick Shane : Got it. It's helpful. And I agree with that conclusion. It just feels like on a day-to-day basis, we're all using less cash. And I'm wondering if that's just driving more and more -- creating more and more transactors for you guys. John Greene : Yes. Thanks for the question. Anything else? . Rick Shane : That's it. Thank you, guys. John Greene : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning, John. Good morning, Roger. So John, maybe a question on the allowance. If I look I recognize that, obviously, this is a life of loan count. But when I look at the level of reserve today, you're only modestly below where you were at March of 2020, call it low 7s versus high 6s. So can you maybe just give us a little bit more color in terms of what's assumed in the reserve in terms of scenarios. And if we see a modest downturn just given how healthy your consumers are, like what could that do to both losses in the allowance over time? Thanks. John Greene : Sure. So as I mentioned in my previous comments, we looked at a number of different scenarios. But I can give you a couple of data points here. In terms of unemployment, it ranged from a low of about 3.3 at the end of 2022 to a peak of 5.8 and then as we look for 2023, 3.5 to just about 5.5. We're seeing a level of GDP growth slowing. We haven't baked in a full recession, but certainly, the GDP does reduce and is near 0 in one of the scenarios we ran. And the employment situation is still as robust, and we certainly considered that as well. So, as we look out into '23, we're going to evaluate what the macro conditions are and the impact on life of loan losses.  But for me, is the portfolio performance really, really strong, job market really, really strong, uncertainty on the broad macros and we conservatively model those. So overall, I feel like we're 100% consistent with how we've reserved in the past. We've taken that through the cycle, underwriting approach that has benefits through into the portfolio, and we've been conservative in our process to ensure that our reserves are fairly stated under GAAP. Ryan Nash : Got it. And maybe, Roger, maybe a follow-up to Sanjay's question. I guess, given that it doesn't sound like you're expecting much in terms of cost from this investigation, I guess, maybe just talk about -- to spend the buyback? And I know that you're limited in what you could say, but any sense for the timing of how long an investigation like this could take? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Yes. No, I am to your point, limited what I can say. We can't really give you anything to expect in timing other than, you know our views on capital. And so as soon as we can, we hope to restart the buyback. Ryan Nash : I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll figure that. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is now open. Mark DeVries : Yes, thanks. Just one more question on the buyback. When you are able to resume, should we expect the cadence to kind of mirror what you did in the first half of this year, or could you accelerate repurchases? John Greene : We'll look at that, Mark. Certainly, we have that broad authorization for the Board for over five quarters. It's $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion of repurchases. So, depending on the pause, we'll see what we can do because certainly, we're over regulatory minimums, were certainly over our internal target. And as we've said previously, we're committed to stepping the CET1 ratio down to 10.5%. So, we'll do what we can do. Mark DeVries : Okay. Great. And then maybe a question for Roger. I mean, just given kind of fintech valuations, is there anything that looks interesting here to deploy that capital inorganically? Roger Hochschild : Good question. I think while valuations have pulled back, I'm not sure there are any bargains yet. But for us, we've tended not to focus on partnerships and potential investments as opposed to acquisitions. And a lot of capabilities, given our great technology team, we feel like we can build ourselves. So, we have a good business development effort that what was out there, but I wouldn't necessarily expect something. Mark DeVries : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. John Pancari : Good morning. John Greene : Good morning. Roger Hochschild : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Just -- sorry, back to the student loan issue. Just -- I know you've given, all, that you can comment on, but there's also -- in the public, we know that there's also a consent order related to this with the CFPB, it looks like in 2020, and I believe it's even tied to a consent order for 2015. Did that impact -- did that influence the suspension? And was there something new that develops that caused the internal investigation? Roger Hochschild : I guess the only thing I can say is both the consent order and the investigation are in the area of student loan servicing. But beyond that, there really isn't anything else I can add at this time. John Pancari : Okay. All right. Thank you. Thanks for helping there. And then separately, just on the -- this is sort of related to it, but we're around the expenses. I know you indicated that the investigation is already contemplated into the expense guide. And I appreciate that color. Does that mean that there were potential expense offsets that would help keep the expense guide unchanged or that getting back to your earlier comment that there is unlikely to be an expense impact? John Greene : Yes. So John, the way I would think about it is we're continuing to kind of run and manage our business and try to be disciplined in the way we distribute expense dollars and spend expense dollars. Certainly, there's puts and takes in every single expense line. And we've continued to have our foot on the gas in terms of new account acquisition and media, which contributed to the marketing increases. The rest of it is we consider as part of the cost of our operation and we're trying to make it as efficient as we can. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks for that. If I could just ask one more on the credit side. I know the delinquencies edged up a little bit year-over-year for 2Q. Was -- did you see any pressure including in the lower FICO bands, or any color around the modest increase in delinquencies that you saw? John Greene : Yes. So what we're seeing is the lower FICO bands normalizing. So -- and you would expect those to normalize more quickly than the higher FICO bands and frankly, we consider that when we do our underwriting. What -- interestingly, what we've seen is early stage delinquencies across the board have corrected in later-stage buckets more quickly than we see it in the past. And some of that could be our -- some of the work we've done in terms of analytics an optimized time to contact and collection strategies and some of it could be just customer performance. So there's really no takeaways from the portfolio other than it continues to perform very, very well and gave us a degree of comfort as we reduce the overall reserve rate. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Roger Hochschild : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Just on the investigation, one for me here. You did mention that it is embedded in your full year guide on expenses. And I'm wondering if we should take that to mean that you expect the review will be finalized by the end of this year. Is that a fair conclusion? Roger Hochschild : I wouldn't necessarily link those too. I mean, I think what we can say is that, we do not see anything that would change our view that nonmarketing expenses this year would grow in the low single digits. And we did indicate that we would hope to have it concluded, but it's done by an independent committee that reports to the Board. Betsy Graseck : Right. And the buyback restarting is a function of the investigation concluding, is that fair rather than like a regular CET1 level? Roger Hochschild : Yes. The termination of the buyback has nothing to do with our capital levels. It does not necessarily require the investigation to be fully complete for us to resume there are many complex factors that go into it. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So, it's a bit open-ended on our end, thinking about when to put it back in the model. I realize you understand that. So, I suppose it will be a wide range of opinions after this call on that. just on the business, can we talk a little bit about the interchange rate, the gross interchange rate has been really strong in recent quarters. And wondering if there's anything in particular driving that, are there increases in competitors that you're matching or is there something else going on? Thanks. John Greene : Yes. The overall interchange has largely been a function of the robust sales volume. So, we're up \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our sales were up 20% through the first half of the year, 18% through the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 into the second quarter. So that's driving overall interchange. Now mix does come into play in terms of the interchange rate. And obviously, we don't spend a lot of time discussing that.  But overall, the solid business performance is driving interchange. And then maybe your follow-on might be, rewards. We did see a spike in rewards which to me, wasn't a bad thing whatsoever. What happened was gas was one of the 5% categories in the quarter, everybody knows about the inflation at the pump. So, we had a larger percentage of customers maxing out on that 5% category, which drove the rate up. But overall, the rate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the rate is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we expect 2 to 4 basis points of inflation there. So, interchange in the aggregate, super strong interchange rate very, very solid rewards coming in at expectations. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Yes. And that was the follow-up. So, appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Meng Jiao : Hey good morning, guys and thanks for taking my question. John, you mentioned, I think, sales growth was about 18% through the end of second quarter. I wanted to see if that was sort of holding through the first three weeks of the third quarter? And then are you -- are there any specific verticals you called out in terms of sales volume? John Greene : Yes. So it is holding. So through Monday, it was up 17%. So again, incredibly robust. Those figures actually have surprised me a little bit to the upside, which is nice. We're seeing travel increase. Obviously, we're seeing petroleum increase. And the everyday categories have increased. The one thing that we did see through the first half is home improvement spend actually decrease versus everyday spend. So it's still positive year-over-year, but not increasing at the same rate as everyday spend in other retail. Meng Jiao : Okay. Got it. That makes sense. And then, I guess secondly, are you guys sort of seeing any change in consumer behavior in regards to the inflationary environment in terms of sort of any substitution effects or anything that -- any color there would be helpful. John Greene : Yes. We're seeing a little bit of it. We believe that in terms of gas that there's -- certainly, it's significantly up year-over-year, but call it the volume of transactions indicate a certain level of substitution or decrease in consumption levels. And then across the other categories, nothing discernible at this point, but we do expect in the second half of this year with the high rate of inflation that consumers are going to make some choices and substitutions or decrease in consumptions will likely happen. Meng Jiao : All right. Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Kevin Barker : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just one last follow-up on the student loan side. You had -- the charge-offs ticked up, although they're fairly low still on student loans, but it is still higher than what we've seen from a quarterly run rate basis for the last few years. Is there anything related there to the investigation on why the charge-offs may have ticked higher just in this particular quarter, given credit metrics have been extraordinarily good within that portfolio? Roger Hochschild : Yes. No, those aren't linked. And actually, I would view it as sort of a one-time move, and we feel very good about the credit in our student loan portfolio. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then -- in regards to the outlook for NIM, I appreciate everything for this year. But as you look out, further out, just given the yield curve today, do you expect some reversion back to your longer-term NIM down to a low 10% just given deposit costs are likely to remain fairly elevated as we go into next year or maybe even continue to move higher, just given the short end of the curve moving higher combined with maybe a flattening on the long end. Is there anything you're seeing there that would cause NIM to maybe start to soften as we move into the beginning of next year? John Greene : Yes, good question. So I would say that. So my expectation is that NIM will peak this year. And there are a number of factors impacting it. Certainly, you mentioned deposit costs. That's going to kind of create some impact. We're going to have impacts on credit, which will impact it. But fundamentally, our funding mix has changed, which will, I believe, will drive improved net interest margin versus historical levels. Kevin Barker : Okay. Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Mihir Bhatia : Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Maybe I'll start with just on the competitive intensity a little bit. You are seeing quite disciplined on revolves and operating costs even as you drive growth. Could you talk a little bit about where your account growth is coming from? And then even I ask is, we've seen a few aggressive offers around cashback introduced in recent months. That's historically been your daily  rig. So, I was curious if you are seeing any kind of impact from some of those offers out in the market? Roger Hochschild : Yes. There are different competitors who will do different offers. We tend to try and be more consistent and sustainable. So, we like the double cash back for the first year has worked very well for us. So yes, someone will be $300, $500, you'll see different issuers doing very long-term balanced transfers. We just don't think that's really driving sustainable growth. And a lot of that promotional activity can drive sort of new accounts, but not necessarily long-term relationships. So, we like our long-term focus and approach, and it has served us well in a variety of competitive environments. Mihir Bhatia : Thank you. Sorry, and I don't mean to beat the dead horse here, but for me, just one question on the buyback suspension. Is that something that regulators require or encourage you to do, while you get your arms around the servicing issues or was the decision to suspend buybacks is solely driven by you internally at DFS and the Board? Roger Hochschild : Yes. The decision was made by Discover. Mihir Bhatia : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Dominick Gabriele : Hey great. Thanks so much for taking my question. I just -- I was wondering, how do you monitor want versus needs-based loan growth as the consumer might feel some pressure both on an individual and a portfolio level, how do you monitor that? Is there some internal data that perhaps we don't have access to that help you understand good borrowing behavior versus bad borrowing behavior, outside of delinquency trends? Thanks. And I just have a follow-up. Roger Hochschild : Yes. I mean it's a bit of a different answer for the portfolio, but for new accounts. But I would say for our new accounts, virtually all of it is want based, right. We're not accepting anyone who doesn't have significant availability on other credit cards outside of potentially our secured card where some of those people, we represent their first card. So, it really is about want and having a better value proposition than they're seeing with their other cards. Dominick Gabriele : Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then I was just curious, how long out does your through-the-cycle loss expectation look out for changes in economic overlays? So does it include today let's say, through the fourth quarter of 2023? Given our analysis, we see that, that's the rough timing where some of these macro domino's might fall into place with possibly higher unemployment related net charge-offs. So how does the weighting work and from a timing perspective of when you think an event may actually begin to occur and affect either your growth algorithm or your loss algorithm, anything you can provide on that would be really great. Thank you. Roger Hochschild : Yes. I would say we tend to look out roughly four to five years, but it is not as sensitive in terms of whether it's in 18 months or two years or 2.5 years. If you think about this is a long-term product and the cash flows associated with a credit card. And if you're not careful, you can find yourself whipping around your new account criteria every week based on sort of the latest change in economic forecasts. So while we can react quickly if it's far enough out, you're not going to see sort of continuous adjustment for that. And then for the portfolio, it's much more driven by account level dynamics, we're really looking at the risk of individual accounts. Dominick Gabriele : Excellent. Thanks so much for overall. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open. Bob Napoli : Hi, thank you and good morning, everybody. Really solid fundamental results, great to see. Just on the network, leveraging the network partnerships, when you have the Ariba CECL, but just having this global payments network. And just any update you can on your efforts to leverage that network. I know Ariba B2B payments, is there anything else on the table there? I mean, that continues to grow nicely. But just any thoughts there that make the network payments portion of the business, a larger part of the company. Roger Hochschild : Yes. Great question. So I did talk about one of our latest network-to-network deals. So we continue to invest and expand acceptance. And some of those deals to also generate volume and more cross-border volume for us. We remain in a wide range of discussions with different fintech players, truly around the world, but we tend not to comment on deals. I would point out too, though, we see a lot of value from the network, not just in the Payment Services segment, but for the differentiation and capabilities it gives our card issuing business, and in particular, the support it provides for rewards on debit, which is a real differentiator in the marketplace. Bob Napoli : Thank you. My follow-up is, I guess, rewards on debit, it seems like a pretty good opportunity for Discover. Any updated information you can give us on cash back debit and the importance to your business over the next five years or potential benefits from that? Roger Hochschild : Yes. I think long term, it will be really exciting and a great benefit for the business and provide another entry point into the franchise versus most of our customers now coming from the credit card. We continue to be deliberate in terms of how we grow that. We want to make sure that we're really solid operationally that we have the right fraud prevention in place. But it's a business we're going to scale for the long term. And again, really excited about some of the early signs we're seeing in terms of cost per account and the usage from some of the customers we're putting on. Bob Napoli : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Don Fandetti : John, I was wondering on the funding side, if you could talk a little bit about the ABS market. I know you've been a bit more active in some other card issuers. Are you pleased with sort of the post-pandemic from a depth in pricing and leverage perspective and also the same question in terms of brokered CDs? John Greene : Yes. Yes. Great question. So, I'm going to kind of break it into kind of two categories. So very pleased with the team's execution when we go into the ABS market. I feel like the offerings are solid and the execution has been very, very good. The other side of the coin is, when we were in that low-rate environment, the all-in rates on some of those transactions were unbelievable. We were down at 71 basis points. So, it took me personally a little bit to come to terms with something in the 2s or 3s right now. But that's a function of where we are and relative to what we're driving in terms of top line yield, it's still super-efficient, secured and an important funding source.  The rest of the funding stack continues to be stable. The broker CDs that you mentioned, they're pricing higher than our online deposits and we're trying to get the right balance in terms of, ensure we're competitive, that we're not a market leader in terms of pricing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 deposit pricing decisions, but also not having to kind of lean into more expensive funding sources. But we'll continue to evolve there and make sure we're making good, efficient choices for the franchise. Don Fandetti : Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Arren Cyganovich. Your line is now open. Arren Cyganovich : Thanks. The stronger loan growth that you've seen recently and increasing your guidance for the full year. How much of normalizing of payment rates is included in that versus just the continued momentum that you're having in acquiring new accounts? John Greene : Yes, Arren, thanks for the question. Very little. So, we modeled out a sustained high payment rate normalization back in through 2023 and frankly it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a payment rate should reduce, that provides some more energy for growth. We haven't anticipated that the drivers of growth have been kind of the strong sales performance, the new accounts that we put on the books in the later part of '20 and into '21 and into this year.  And customers putting our card top of wallet. So we've been really pleased and feel like the balance of kind of risk versus opportunity in terms of additional growth is probably more on the opportunity side at this point. Arren Cyganovich : Okay. Thanks. And then secondly, the internal investigation, obviously, that's internal. Have you discussed this with the regulators already? Are they involved? I just want to know if there's another leg, so to speak to drop with respect to this? ` Roger Hochschild : Yes. That's something I can't comment on. I would say though, in terms of internal, just to reinforce it is independent from the Board. But I can't comment on our discussions with regulators. Arren Cyganovich : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A. I would now like to turn the program back over to Mr. Wasserstrom for any additional or closing remarks. Eric Wasserstrom : Well, thank you all for joining us. The IR team is available all day, so please reach us with any additional questions, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2022 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you, Katie and good morning everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s call. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our third quarter\u2019s earnings release, press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, you will be permitted to ask one question followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, Eric and thanks to our listeners for joining today\u2019s call. I\u2019m very pleased with our results this quarter. Against a fluid macroeconomic backdrop, we generate strong financial performance while continuing to advance our strategic priorities. Let\u2019s start with a summary on Slide 3. For the third quarter, we reported net income of $1 billion after tax or $3.54 per share. Over the past three months, as Fed policy has become more restrictive, it has made fears of a recession more acute. Against this backdrop, the key narratives of the third quarter results are the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our earnings. Our increase in revenues this year has been largely driven by our strong receivables growth with loans up 17% year-over-year. This growth was driven largely by elevated sales volume and the increased number of new accounts we\u2019ve added since mid-2021. We continue to use a through-the-cycle approach to underwriting, which considers all stages of a credit cycle, including downturns. As part of our conservative credit management, we marginally tightened our new account underwriting criteria this quarter. Given these factors, we consider our growth to be consistent with current macroeconomic conditions. Naturally, discussion of \u2013 session of elicits concerns about credit quality, but the credit performance of our loan portfolio at this stage does not suggest anything other than gradual normalization. Nonetheless, a late-cycle environment requires a particular awareness of changing conditions and underscores the importance of our strong financial condition. We also continue to advance our strategic priorities. As a few examples, in August, we expanded our global presence with the signing of Woori Card of the largest issuers in South Korea. The extension of this relationship as well as the number of new network partnerships we\u2019ve announced this year highlight our focus on expanding our international presence. We continue to demonstrate the value of our network and our growing relationships with fintech partners. As an example, we announced in October that we will facilitate payments for TYDEi\u2019s new healthcare vendor management system, which will digitize and streamline payments in an industry where legacy purchasing is still primarily manual. Finally, this summer, we announced the opening of our new Advanced Analytics Resource Center at our downtown Chicago location. The first cohort of 75 individuals, which we selected from over 1,000 applicants has already started, and we intend to grow the program with an additional cohort in 2023. This follows the grand opening of our customer care center in the South Side neighborhood of Chatham earlier this year and underscores our commitment to bring additional jobs to Chicago while supporting great customer experiences. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John to review our results in more detail. John Greene : Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start with our financial summary results on Slide 4. There were three important trends in the quarter : strong asset growth, net interest margin expansion and modest credit normalization. The strength in asset growth, combined with a NIM rate improvement increased revenue 8% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. Asset growth resulted in an increase in our reserves under CECL of $304 million, but our reserve coverage ratio declined slightly. So while our reported net income was down 8% year-over-year, adjusting for the reserve change, our net income would have been 28% higher on a year-over-year basis. Let\u2019s review the details starting on Slide 5. Net interest income was up $438 million year-over-year or 18%, driven by higher average receivables and improved net interest margin. We achieved a record high NIM rate of 11.05%, up 25 basis points from the prior year and 11 basis points sequentially. On both a year-over-year and sequential basis, the increase in net interest margin primarily reflects the higher prime rate, partially offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional and balance transfers. Receivable growth was driven by card, which increased 19% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong sales and the contribution from new accounts growth last year and into this year. Sales growth was 15% in the period, a deceleration from the 20% growth we experienced in the first half of the year. As anticipated, the sales decline was partially mitigated by a decrease in the payment rate, which fell 70 basis points in the quarter. Nonetheless, it remains more than 400 basis points over 2019 levels. We expect payment rate to continue to decline through the back half of 2023, which should help support receivable growth. Turning to our non-card products, organic student loans increased 4% as a result of peak season originations. Personal loans were up 11%, the growth reflects our disciplined approach to marketing, underwriting and pricing of this product, which we believe has created an attractive competitive position for us in the market, particularly relative to some non-bank originators. In terms of funding mix, our customer deposit balances were up 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. So far, deposit pricing has been in line with what we expected in a rising rate environment. As we mentioned last quarter, our strong asset growth has caused deposits to various proportion of our funding mix, but we continue to target 70% to 80% deposit funding over the medium term. We also issued $2 billion of card ABS fixed notes in the quarter and booked $5 billion of broker deposits. We maintain broad access to a variety of funding sources, enabling us to confidently fund our asset growth. Looking at other revenue on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased $264 million or 71%. This was partially due to a $157 million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter compared to a $4 million loss this quarter. Adjusting for these, our non-interest income was up 19%. This was driven by higher net discount and interchange revenue, which was up $47 million or 16%, reflecting strong sales and favorable sales mix, partially offset by higher rewards costs. Similar to last quarter, we estimate that inflation contributed between 200 basis points and 250 basis points of sales growth in the period. The strong sales also drove higher reward expenses. Consistent with the prior quarter, our rewards rate increased 3 basis points year-over-year, driven by substantial growth in new accounts, increasing the cost of our cash back program. Year-to-date, our rewards rate is up 2 basis points, consistent with our expectation of 2 basis points to 4 basis points of annual reward rate inflation. Moving to expenses on Slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $198 million or 17% year-over-year and up 13% from the prior quarter. Compensation costs were up primarily due to increased headcount. Our servicing organization is a key component of our value proposition. We expect to grow this as our accounts and assets expand. This will contribute to an increase in salary and wages through the end of this year and into next year. Marketing expenses increased $66 million or 31% as we continue to invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products. We grew new card accounts by 22% from last year\u2019s third quarter. Professional fees increased $43 million or 22% as a result of investments in technology and increased consulting costs. We also had additional fraud costs in the consumer bank, driven by increased volumes as well as some legal expense elevating our other expense category in the quarter. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 1.71% or 25 basis points higher than the prior year, but down 9 basis points from the prior quarter. Total net charge-off dollars were up $114 million from the prior year and only up $10 million sequentially. In the card portfolio, the net charge-off rate of 1.92% was 27 basis points higher than the prior year and 9 basis points lower sequentially. Similar to our commentary from last quarter, we are not seeing evidence of emerging credit stress beyond normal expected normalization. Delinquencies among our lower prime segment have been normalized, but in upper prime delinquencies and charge-offs remain below pre-pandemic levels. This is consistent with our baseline expectation that credit will continue to normalize over the next several quarters\u2019 absence a change in macro conditions. Turning to the discussion of our allowance on Slide 9. This past quarter, we increased our allowance by $304 million due to higher receivable balances. Our reserve rate modestly declined to 6.7%. For us, changes through \u2013 to employment conditions pose the most significant risk to loss levels. As part of our reserving process, we have considered the prospects of higher unemployment among a range of macroeconomic scenarios and is reflected in our reserve balance. Looking at Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 13.9%. The strong asset growth was a primary driver of the approximate 30 basis point decline from the prior period. Our long-term target remains 10.5%. In terms of capital return, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.60 per share and repurchased $212 million of common stock in the period before we decided to temporarily suspend our buyback activity. Concluding on Slide 11. As we look at the last quarter of the year, our prospects for 2022 remain favorable, and we are once again improving elements of our expectations. We are revising our view on loan growth to high teens, continued strong sales, new account acquisitions through the third quarter and some recent improvements in the payment rates support our confidence in the outlook. In terms of NIM, we expect the full year to be mildly above the high end of our expected range with sequential margin improvement in the fourth quarter based on rate hikes that happened in late September. We are revising our expense outlook to be up high single digits versus the prior year, driven by increased marketing and compensation costs. In line with previous communications, we still expect marketing costs to come in above 2019 levels as we\u2019ve discussed. We expect to add headcount, which will elevate salary and wages as well as benefit expense. Excluding these two categories, expenses are expected to increase by low single digits. We now expect net charge-offs to be between 1.8% and 1.9% for the full year, driven by lower-than-expected credit losses through this point in the year. Our temporary pause on share repurchases remains in place, but we hope to resume share repurchases before year-end. In summary, receivable growth accelerated as we continue to benefit from elevated sales, strong new account acquisitions and improvements in the payment rate. NIM continues to benefit from prime rate increases. Funding costs are consistent with expectations and credit performance is slowly normalizing, reflecting our disciplined approach to underwriting and credit management. These results demonstrate the resiliency of our integrated digital banking and payments model. Our earnings power, coupled with our strong balance sheet and capital position, keeps us well positioned for continued profitable growth through a range of economic conditions. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to our operator, Katie, to open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning guys. Roger Hochschild : Good morning. Ryan Nash : So maybe to start on the net interest margin John, you commented that it implies another uptick given the rate hikes that we saw at the end of the quarter. Can you maybe just talk about where we go from here on the margin? I think last quarter; you talked about it potentially peaking out. I\u2019m just curious; do you think you can continue to hold their line around these levels? And maybe what is incorporated within that in terms of deposit betas and the like? John Greene : Great. Okay. Thanks for the question, Ryan. There\u2019s a lot there. So, let me start with the fundamentals that we\u2019re seeing. So the liability side of the balance sheet is certainly subjected to increases in deposit funding costs as a result of competitive actions and general needs across the market to attract some deposits. With that said, the 11% plus we delivered in the third quarter; we do expect some upside from that as a result of the Fed hikes in September. So certainly, sequentially into the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll see further improvement. Now, beyond the \u2013 excuse me, beyond into the fourth quarter \u2013 we\u2019ll see improvement. Beyond the fourth quarter at this point, we\u2019re going to reserve any commentary. But what I would say is, we don\u2019t expect any specific, I\u2019ll say, seismic changes to net interest margins in 2023 based on the stability of our funding base and turn access to multiple sources of funds. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thanks for the color. Roger, maybe one for you. You mentioned you guys are marginally tightening on account acquisition. Can you maybe just give additional color regarding some of the changes you\u2019re making to underwriting? And what do you think this might mean for growth over the intermediate term? Thanks. Roger Hochschild : Sure. So, I would start by saying, in general, it remains a very good environment. We\u2019re seeing cost per account on the prime side below what we had last year. The value proposition is resonating well. For the new account space at the margin, we tightened some of those segments that will be most volatile in a downturn. So, I think the lower end of prime. And we\u2019re ready to take further action on new accounts or the portfolio side. But again, I\u2019d say overall, a very good environment, and that\u2019s part of why you\u2019re seeing such strong growth. Ryan Nash : Got it. Appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. I was hoping maybe you could talk for a little bit of a different tack. Maybe talk a little bit about the competitive environment and what you\u2019re seeing from a credit standpoint and from a competitive marketing standpoint, kind of, in your two installment loan businesses, both in the personal loan business and the student loan business and maybe talk about that and the outlook there for a moment? Roger Hochschild : Yes. So it is hard Moshe to know what individual competitors are doing. I would say in general, most of them are much broader spectrum lenders than we are. And so my guess is we\u2019d be seeing some stress at the lower ends of their books. For us, a rising rate environment creates a lot of focus on debt consolidation, which is the primary use of our personal loans. So, we\u2019re maintaining a very disciplined credit criteria by seeing strong originations in that segment. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. Thanks. It is interesting. I mean, I think we\u2019ve seen that for others that are at the higher end of the credit spectrum where the stress you\u2019re talking about we do see at the lower end. Follow-up question that I had is, you talked about hoping to restart the buyback by year-end or so, a little bit growth kind of causing a 30 basis point downtick in your capital, but you\u2019re still well above. Just talk about, I guess, the appetite for that given \u2013 and does the kind of macro environment figure into that? Just talk about the appetite for the buyback once that restarts? Thanks. John Greene : Yes. Sure. Moshe, I\u2019ll take that. So from a overall capital level, we are very well capitalized, right? So, we\u2019re 13% approaching, 14% on the CET1. Our target is 10.5%. The credit book has been very, very stable. It\u2019s normalizing, but overall, very, very stable. So the capital allocation priorities through the firm remain in place. So first is to invest in strong organic growth, second would be a return of capital, and then third, perhaps a bolt-on acquisition, and we\u2019re going to do that will likely be in the Payments segment. So overall, those priorities didn\u2019t change. So the suspension remains in place, but we\u2019re hopeful that it will resume \u2013 buybacks will resume here in the fourth quarter. Moshe Orenbuch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. John, I wanted to just walk through the expense guide increase. You mentioned it\u2019s a blend of marketing and comp costs. Could you just parse apart what part is \u2013 how much of each sort of contributed to the increase? And I\u2019m just trying to put the marketing comments to slightly pulling back the credit box. And then as far as like the headcount increases, was that related to the growth? I\u2019m just trying to figure out what changed in terms of the comp cost? John Greene : Yes. Yes, happy to help with that, Sanjay. So let me provide some context upfront here. So year-to-date total expenses are up 7%. Comp expense is up 5%, and excluding marketing, our expense base year-to-date is up 2%. So actually really, really what I\u2019ll say first half of the year and into this quarter some strong fundamentals. Now, we did have a significant growth in the asset base, which of course, means that there are accounts that we\u2019re going to have to service. And you might have seen a press release that came out that indicated we were hiring about 2,000 servicing agents through the balance of this year and into next year depending on the balance sheet and our customer value proposition and metrics. So overall, the strong growth and the strong acquisition has necessitated investments in our people. We\u2019ll continue to do that. We\u2019ve also made specific investments in information technology, specifically around resources advanced analytics in order to further position us to be able to grow profitably and then also enhance underwriting and customer targeting. So, we believe all those investments make perfect sense for the long term. And what you\u2019re seeing here in the third quarter is a combination of what I\u2019ll say is a tough comp as a result of some turnover last year. And then us coming on with backfilling resources, what I\u2019ll say is salaried resources as well as the investments I talked about in terms of customer service. So hopefully, that provides some context and color to your question. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then I know we\u2019re trying to read between the lines in terms of the student loan servicing inquiry or investigation that\u2019s going on. But just to be clear, there is no change to how you guys are thinking about it relative to last quarter. And as far as the expenses are concerned, it seems like things are progressing as you expected it to and it\u2019s just a matter of timing. Is that a correct statement? John Greene : Yes, that is a correct statement. So no change. Obviously, when we have some news to share, we\u2019re going to share it. The expense guidance we provided and the updates reflect those items I discussed on your previous question and no specific changes related to expenses related to the buybacks as mentioned. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is now open. John Hecht : Good morning guys. Actually, most of my questions have been asked, and I was going to ask one about marketing. But maybe since you addressed the spend patterns, maybe can you talk about \u2013 just because it\u2019s a topic that we haven\u2019t really talked about in detail recently your perspective on rewards and the competitive environment around rewards and what that means for the intermediate term? Roger Hochschild : Yes. Sure. So a lot of the most intense competition on rewards is in the super prime segment, and we\u2019ve talked over the last year or two, how we think some of the propositions issuers are putting out aren\u2019t necessarily sustainable in the long run. As John mentioned, our rewards costs are moving up exactly as we forecast. We haven\u2019t felt the need to make any structural changes to our program. So as you can see from the growth in the new accounts, our value proposition competes very well in that prime revolver segment. And so while the market is always competitive, we bring a differentiated value proposition that resonates well with consumers. John Hecht : Okay. And then second question is maybe thinking about like a 2021 cohort, and I know it\u2019s probably early for the 2022 cohort, but what can you tell us in terms of how they\u2019re seasoning utilization rates and kind of delinquency seasoning? Is there \u2013 is it back to what it looked like in 2019? Or is there something different that\u2019s worth pointing out with respect to more recent vintages? Roger Hochschild : Yes. I would say more recent vintages are performing exactly in line with our expectations, right? I mean every vintage got distorted during the pandemic. So you saw it cut across the curves. But again, we feel very good about the performance. John Hecht : Okay. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open. John Pancari : Good morning. Roger Hochschild : Good morning. John Pancari : On the efficiency ratio came in around 40% for the third quarter. And just given the commentary that you gave around the investments that you\u2019re making and your expense expectations, can you maybe help us think about how that could shape up for the fourth quarter, and more importantly into 2023, how we could think about the trajectory there? Thanks. John Greene : Yes. John thanks for the question. So, what we said in the past and what we\u2019ve told our Board and what we\u2019re targeting is an efficiency ratio in the high 30s [ph]. And through this year, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job in terms of being able to deliver that. Certainly the really strong growth and the great performance through the first half on expense \u2013 on the expense base. And then the third quarter reflects some investments and despite those investments, still below 40%. We\u2019re going to continue to make investments where we see an opportunity to drive great returns for our shareholders. And as we approach 2023, we are aware that the economic environment is a little tougher. We do feel like we have remaining tailwinds in terms of asset growth and we do have investments we\u2019re going to continue to make. So, I would say for 2023 specifically, we will come out in January to give more specific details. But the overall commitments remain in place, commitment to positive operating leverage and efficiency ratio south of 40% and expense discipline while investing for growth. John Pancari : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the reserve front, just wanted to get your take on how you see that trajecting here? I know you allowed the reserve to bleed a bit in terms of the ratio this quarter. But now as you\u2019re seeing some of the normalization that you indicated and some of the pressure on delinquencies, how should we think about the reserve as you look here, particularly as you factor in the economic conditions and how you\u2019re looking at the economy, the impact on the economy plays out? Thanks. John Greene : Yes. Great. Yes, thanks for that question. So a little bit of context there. So, we put on about $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion worth of assets in the quarter. Our reserves increased by $304 million. So, as we look at the portfolio and the macro environment, we\u2019re seeing the portfolio continuing to be very, very stable but normalizing. The macro environment indications of a recession are certainly increasing. Roger mentioned in his comments about some mild \u2013 in his comments about some mild tightening. So in terms of expectation around reserves, we\u2019ll continue to take a look at the macros. We\u2019ll run multiple scenarios and then make sure the balance sheet, the portfolio specifically continues to perform as anticipated and will make appropriate calls for reserves under GAAP. It\u2019s really tough to give any specific guidance on that other than we\u2019re going to be mindful of the macros, continue to watch the portfolio, and that prime revolver targeting we do, tends to add high-level stability. As matter of fact one other point that may be useful not specific to reserves, but rather charge-offs. You have to go all the way back to the second quarter of 2011 to see charge-offs that \u2013 charge-off rates that is north of 4%. So, we\u2019re seeing great stability this year, and we expect it to be stable next year as well. John Pancari : Got it. Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Roger Hochschild : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : I just wanted to see if I could get you to unpack your statement on no seismic changes in 2023. Maybe we could speak a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking \u2013 and I know you just detailed a little bit, but how you\u2019re thinking about how the loan yield should traject. I know in the slide deck, you called out that the loan yield was driven by prime obviously, but with a partial offset from higher promotional mix and the timing of pricing changes. Could you help us understand how that works? How much the promo mix and the timing impacted loan yields and how you\u2019re thinking about that trajecting as we continue to go through a Fed rate hike period here? John Greene : Okay. Yes. So there\u2019s a lot there. And as you know, it\u2019s fairly complex Betsy, but I\u2019ll do my best to create some transparency here. So \u2013 and let me start with the loan yields. So 80% of our book is floating rate of the asset side. So as the Fed increases, that creates the opportunity to move the contract rate up with the Fed changes. And correspondingly, if the Fed were to come down, the contract rate would come down. So, what we\u2019re seeing there is in a rising rate environment. We still expect 3 basis points to 5 basis points of yield improvement. So net interest margin yield improvement over a 12-month period. So, we saw significant increases in September. It looks like based on the forward curve, there\u2019s another maybe as much as 125 basis points of further Fed action this year, and then next year, depending on the economy, there could be a couple more or there\u2019ll be a pause. I don\u2019t think there will be much in the way of Fed rate reductions until maybe as late as 2024. So what that means is, we\u2019re going to get the benefit from the Fed rate increases into the portfolio. We\u2019re seeing deposit pricing continue to go up. We haven\u2019t been a price leader on that. Certainly, we\u2019ve been a follower to make sure we have a positive value proposition for our customer base. And then the next question would be around betas and what do you think about betas. So, I\u2019m going to try to address that right now. So as there\u2019s greater disparity between our rates from a deposit standpoint and the brick-and-mortar banks. It creates plenty of opportunity for us to market into those customers and they\u2019ll find an attractive value proposition, which should help dampen the impact of further rate increases. So, we do think the combination of the Fed increases, us being able to manage the deposit book, but in a rising rate environment, stability from a credit standpoint, but normalization, which will create a bit of incremental interest reversals impacting net interest margin. And then ultimately, the pricing decisions we\u2019re going to make where we have that flexibility to make sure we\u2019re making good decisions for our customers and for our shareholders. So ultimately, it nets out that we expect relative stability over net interest margin through 2023. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Got it. And I appreciate that. Thanks. My follow-up has to do with the buyback discussion that we had earlier. And I know you mentioned that you\u2019re hopeful it can resume in 4Q. Would you expect to put out an 8-K, that indicates that you can now resume buybacks? Or would we hear about buybacks only after you started, there\u2019s no obligation to put a notification into the market that you can resume. Thanks. John Greene : Correct. There isn\u2019t an obligation, but we would likely put an 8-K out. Betsy Graseck : Okay. No obligation, but you would likely do it. Okay. Thanks. John Greene : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Robert Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open. Robert Napoli : Yes. Thank you and good morning. So, I just following up on \u2013 it was good to hear to resuming the buybacks. I guess that would suggest that the review is behind you. But would you expect them to get your to go towards your 10.5% target capital ratio? And over what time frame would you like to do that? Or what kind of a buffer do you want above that 10.5%? John Greene : Yes. Hey Bob, thanks for the question. I just want to be very specific about something you said. And our comments have consistently been here on this call that we hope to resume the buyback in the fourth quarter. So, we say that because we\u2019re hopeful, but there\u2019s ultimately, it will be a decision that the Board helps with. So in terms of the 10.5% target, so we\u2019ve been well north of that for quite some time, there\u2019s \u2013 we have said that we want to step towards that, we intend to step towards that. So certainly, the earnings power that the firm has generated and the buybacks as well as dividends, have impacted our ability to get there. So we\u2019re going to step towards that when throughout 2023 and 2024. What we said previously is, we hope to be around the 10.5% target, sometime in 2024 or 2025. Robert Napoli : Thank you. And the follow-up, just on normalization of credit losses. As we think about normalized credit losses there, looking back over history, credit cards, high-3s, I guess, or mid-3s to high-3s personal loans in the 4% range. Is that the way we should think? Is there anything that\u2019s changed? Should we continue to think about normalized credit losses in that kind of an area? John Greene : Yes. Yes. So, I would put two points out there. First, I would take a look at the historical trends and use that and make certain judgments. The other item here, I\u2019m going to say is a matter of judgment. But certainly, I have a belief that credit cards have increased in the payment priority because folks can access the digital economy without a credit card \u2013 some folks with a debit card, but most specifically around a credit card. So that, I believe, helps prioritize the primary credit card among many other debt obligations that a consumer has. So could that impact the relative charge-off rates versus the historical trend? My belief is yes, but your judgment is, what I\u2019d say you should apply when you\u2019re working through your forward-looking outlooks. Robert Napoli : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Don Fandetti : John, personal loan growth was pretty strong this quarter. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the outlook there and growth. And also any updates on your home equity lending initiative? John Greene : Yes. Yes, thanks for the question, Don. So certainly, nice growth there. On the personal loan front, you go back in a few quarters, and it was flat. And we said it was flat to down. Actually, if you go back three or four quarters as a result of some underwriting decisions we took. We\u2019ve been \u2013 we set strength in the underwriting for that product, and it\u2019s given us greater confidence to be able to market that product, and there\u2019s been a high level of appeal to it. So, we\u2019ll continue to be mindful of the product in the face of a tougher economic condition. But certainly, we feel like it\u2019s a good product and its meeting customer needs, and that\u2019s helped drive the growth. In terms of kind of forward-looking guidance, I\u2019m not going to start to do that at a product level, all it would do is ensure that I was wrong more often. But if I go to the kind of the home equity loan, that\u2019s portfolio is relatively small. So it\u2019s actually not moving the dial at this point from an earnings standpoint. But what we\u2019ve seen is a great level of interest in the second lien product, and we\u2019re also originating a first lien product as well. So both products are performing well and nice appeal. Don Fandetti : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Mihir Bhatia : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe I just wanted to start with \u2013 if you just take your guidance for NIM and loan growth, and I think that works out about four point effectively works out of fourth quarter NIM of at least 11.2% and $3 billion plus NII. Is that the right way to think about it and frame the exit rate for NIM? And then should NIM, NII just increase from there given loan growth and your comments about NIM stability. Am I thinking of that correctly? John Greene : Yes. So Mihir, thanks for the question. And I\u2019m certainly appreciate the specificity. What I\u2019ve said about NIM is probably as far as I\u2019m going to go here on this call. We do expect sequential improvement, as I said. Beyond that, it will be tough to give specific details. Mihir Bhatia : Okay. And then just wanted to ask about losses normalizing. A little previously, you had talked about it being in 2H 2023 is when we get to a more normalized loss rate. But I think there was talk that it could maybe push into even 2024 later. Any update on that? Thank you. John Greene : Yes. So normalization through 2023 and the macro environment will help us determine whether it pushes 2023 into 2024. But where we\u2019re sitting today, we\u2019re very pleased with the portfolio performance and the only surprise is frankly, the pace of normalization on the upper end is a little slower than we expected, which helped drive the improved guidance that we gave on the charge-off rate. Mihir Bhatia : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Rick Shane : Thanks everyone for taking my question. Look, your customer base really represents a great sample of the domestic population. I\u2019m curious when you look at spending on a category level basis, if there\u2019s anything that you\u2019re seeing that is a cause for concern, not asking are people spending more of the pump that\u2019s obvious with the inflationary pressures. But are there categories where you\u2019re seeing people use their cards that are signals for something we should be thinking about? Roger Hochschild : Yes. Great question. So our base probably does skew a little upwards, so more in the prime, but we\u2019re seeing continued strength in sales in October. So, I\u2019d say, year-over-year in the low teens. Some of the trends you\u2019ve heard about were picking up. So consumer durables softening in terms of year-over-year. But again, our households, by and large, they have the liquidity to absorb inflation. It causes some pain, and we\u2019ll switch categories, we\u2019ll downgrade within a category. But I would say travel is coming off some of the very, very strong growth we saw over the summer. So a little less strength in travel and consumer durables are probably the key trend. Rick Shane : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning, Roger and John. John Greene : Good morning. Bill Carcache : You mentioned that operating conditions are consistent with late cycle expansion historically. Fed hiking cycles have typically ended in slowing loan growth, but you\u2019re already exceptionally strong loan growth seems to be accelerating, and certainly, the whole industry is enjoying strong growth. Can you share any thoughts around how you\u2019d expect the late cycle expansion to end? And I\u2019ll just layer in my follow-up now. And if you can give any commentary around what level of unemployment is implicit in your reserve rate and what a change in unemployment would mean for the reserve rate, that would be very helpful? Roger Hochschild : Yes. So great question. So, I mean, in terms of late cycle, I think back pre-pandemic, we talked about it being late cycle for a couple of years, and then it ended in a way that I think no one expected. And so that\u2019s part of why we tend to use a through-the-cycle loss rate and look to be disciplined in our credit management. So while I would be, it\u2019s not a time probably to be widening credit. We\u2019re seeing a lot of benefits from the investments in advanced analytics, in particular, around the personal loan product and on the card side, where the growth we\u2019re achieving the growth while swapping in and swapping out different populations. And again, with a policy that I think is appropriate for late cycle. And it builds on some of the really strong new account production we had in 2021 and as those accounts mature. So again, we\u2019ll continue to look at it, both in terms of our portfolio actions as well as new account originations across all of our products, but we feel good about the credit approach and just the traction our products are getting in the marketplace. And I\u2019ll pass it to John for part two. John Greene : Yes. Hey, Bill and in terms of kind of fundamental assumptions for kind of reserve setting. So, as I said earlier, we used a number of different scenarios, which included kind of non-recession scenario as well as the recessionary scenario. The recessionary scenario that we modeled. We certainly didn\u2019t wait as much as the non-recession and also the view in terms of the unemployment rate, there\u2019s pretty wide range right now, right? So some forecasted going north of 6% in a very, what I\u2019ll say, a dark scenario. The more optimistic scenario is 4%. And so we looked at a complete range of scenarios and weighted it more towards stability with increasing unemployment. GDP, not as big a driver, but certainly an indication for the economy. Today, we\u2019re at about 1%, and in 2023 in a recessionary scenario; there would be mild contraction, not deep contraction. So we think, overall, there will be general stability despite a tougher macro. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Kevin Barker : Thank you concerning the comments regarding unemployment rate, maybe some slight tightening on underwriting. That being said, are you seeing any minor shifts in consumer spending or payment patterns that may indicate certain pockets of stress, whether it\u2019s the lower end of prime or other parts or maybe even certain vintages of customers that are on your books? Roger Hochschild : Yes. I mean all the vintages are performing well. As John said, I think we\u2019re seeing the normalization occur faster and pretty close to fully normalized for the lower end of prime. While the payment rate has softened a bit and come down by about 70 basis points, it remains 400 basis points higher than 2019 levels. And so I think that speaks to the fact that there\u2019s still very strong employment market out there, people can find jobs, can find extra hours. And so a good amount of liquidity that is supporting the deferred for our segment. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then I know it\u2019s a fluid situation, but the student debt repayment is supposed to restart here maybe early next year or who knows, given what\u2019s happening with the fighting in the courts, but do you expect any incremental impact to credit with a lot of student debt payments. Obviously, there\u2019s the forgiveness is obviously a credit positive, but is there something that you could see as a potential headwind as student debt repayments restart here potentially in January? Roger Hochschild : Not necessarily. We\u2019ve watched it closely. I mean I think we have experienced an elevated payment rate, which has a dampening impact on loan growth as students have put more of their payments towards their private student loans. But we don\u2019t see anything that would have a significant impact on credit. Kevin Barker : Okay, thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is now open. Mark DeVries : Yes. Thanks. How should we think about how you manage expense discipline, if we start to see some revenue and credit weakness if the economy softens here? John Greene : Yes. I would just simply say that we will take a look at the opportunities we have in front of us, and we\u2019ll make what I hope will be great long-term decisions for our shareholders. And we\u2019re going to be very, very mindful around discretionary spending and around employment decisions. So overall, we hope we\u2019re good stewards of the company. Mark DeVries : Okay. Got it. And then just given where the rewards cost has trended so far this year in the guidance I think you said it was 2 basis points but guidance is 2% to 4%. Is it right to assume that 4Q is a relatively big quarter for expenses? Maybe you\u2019ve got more of the 5% categories this quarter. John Greene : Yes. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily assume that what the point of the guidance between two and four is that\u2019s what we had said previously still within the range, and we wanted to keep it within the range. So that 2% to 4% is something that we\u2019ve seen historically, and to an extent, managed to, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. So I wouldn\u2019t lean on any particular information to assume the fourth quarter is going to be extraordinarily high or low. Mark DeVries : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Ryan with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is now open. Bill Ryan : Thanks. Good morning and a couple of quick questions. Just following up on the personal loans business. Historically, it\u2019s been heavily focused on your credit card base. And I was just wondering if that\u2019s still the case. And you also had, I\u2019d say, very, very strong credit checks in that business, paying off creditors directly. Has anything changed there as well? Roger Hochschild : No. So, I would say it\u2019s pretty balanced in terms of cross-hold to the card base versus broad market. Probably the biggest change has been just the continued advancement in analytics and the underwriting approach there but very, very conservative. So a lot of employment verification, et cetera, heavily manual processes just to make sure we get it right because as opposed to the card business where you can manage credit as you go, you get one shot in personal loans. But again, I would say that the performance remains very, very strong there and it\u2019s a lot of it thanks to that disciplined approach. Bill Ryan : Okay. And just one follow-up on the promotional balances, that\u2019s kind of been brought up on the card book for the last several quarters. Is it still increasing as a percentage of the overall card portfolio? Or is it kind of stabilized and maybe give us some historical perspective of where it stands to recent history? Thanks. John Greene : Yes. Thanks. It\u2019s stabilized in the third quarter, basically approach stabilization into the second quarter and it\u2019s very close to where it has been historically. Bill Ryan : Okay, thanks for taking my questions. John Greene : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, thanks so much for taking my questions. Throughout the call and throughout other calls, you\u2019ve kind of laid out your playbook and pieces in particular on the credit side for a slowing economy. But maybe, Roger, you can just provide us with a more holistic idea of what discover would change across various pieces of the businesses to protect profitability in a, of tougher economic environment? And then I just have a follow-up. Thank you. Roger Hochschild : Yes. I\u2019d start by saying we don\u2019t necessarily optimize on protecting profitability on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We focus on sort of delivering long-term value to the shareholders. And I think as I\u2019ve been in this business a while, people who just totally got marketing in a downturn, miss out on what usually turn out to be some of the most profitable vintages. And so yes, you cut marketing mainly because as you tighten the credit box, there are fewer people to market, too. But I think we try and operate our company almost like we\u2019re always in a recession, always be conserved on credit or was be tied on expenses, there\u2019s more you can do, especially around discretionary items. But that ability to keep momentum through a downturn has really distinguished us in previous cycles, and we would try and do that again. Dominick Gabriele : Okay. Great. Thank you. And I think it\u2019d be really helpful to understand what your \u2013 both of your views are on the normalization of the personal loan portfolio net charge-offs versus the credit card portfolio. Consensus has such a huge ramp on the personal loan side versus credit cards for 2023 and \u2013 not looking for specific guidance, but is there any reason why there would be such a difference in faster normalization on the personal loan side versus credit card as far as basis point movement as a percentage of loans? Thanks so much guys. Roger Hochschild : Yes. I mean we haven\u2019t put out product-by-product guidance. But I would say that given how we underwrite the personal loans, I\u2019m not sure why our portfolio would jump much faster than the card book. In general, we have a higher FICO for the personal loans business. They do tend to be a little more volatile than card in a recession. But I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 that isn\u2019t necessarily behavior I would expect. Dominick Gabriele : Great. Thanks so much. Eric Wasserstrom : All right. Well, thank you everyone for joining us. And thank you, Katie. And if there\u2019s any additional follow-ups, please reach out to the IR team. We\u2019ll be here and looking forward to speaking with you. Thanks, and have a great day. John Greene : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s event. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's call. I'll begin on Slide 2 of the earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in the fourth quarter earnings press release and presentation. On our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, you'll be permitted to ask one question followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up questions, please return to the queue. And with that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I want to begin by reviewing the highlights and key metrics for the year, and then John will take you through the details of our fourth quarter results and our perspectives on 2023. I'm very pleased to say that 2022 was the second strongest year for earnings in our company's history. We reported net income of $1 billion or $3.77 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.4 billion or $15.50 per share for the full year. This was accomplished against a fluid and unusual macroeconomic and monetary policy backdrop and I want to thank the entire Discover team for their solid execution. This performance gives us significant momentum going into 2023 and beyond. I want to give a few highlights that underscore these strong results. First, we grew new accounts by 23% and loan receivables by 20%. This demonstrates the appeal of our consumer value proposition and advancements in our consumer targeting and acquisition capabilities while maintaining our conservative approach to underwriting and credit management. We're also prudently investing for growth, including an acquisition and brand marketing, the continuing build-out of our data and analytic capabilities and increasing field personnel for both servicing and collections, all while achieving a 39% efficiency ratio. The combination of revenue expansion and disciplined cost management contributed to our 31% return on equity this past year and underscores the highly capital-generative nature of our business model. Over the course of 2022, we repurchased $2.4 billion in common stock and increased our dividend by over 20%, and we expect to sustain attractive levels of capital return to our shareholders into the future. As we look into 2023, we expect a less favorable macroeconomic backdrop. Nevertheless, we intend to maintain an appropriate level of investment in our organization. For example, we have several initiatives that will improve our digital marketing capabilities, and we anticipate the broad market launch for mass market cash-back debit product. And of course, we'll continue to invest in our brand and in account acquisition in a manner consistent with the environment. We're very aware of the climate in which we are operating. And should there be changes in economic conditions, we will adjust. Our model with its focus on prime lending and through-the-cycle underwriting has historically supported resilient returns through the economic cycle. These factors, combined with our earnings power, reserves and capital, underpin our strategy of being the leading consumer digital bank. I'll now turn the call over to John to review our results in more detail. John Greene : Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary results on Slide 4. The takeaway of the quarter is largely about strong asset growth and net interest margin expansion, partially offset by growth-based provisioning. Asset growth combined with a NIM rate improvement, increased revenue 7% sequentially and 27% year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, asset growth also drove an increase in our reserves of $313 million. This increase kept our reserve coverage ratio relatively flat at 6.6%. In the prior year, we released $39 million of reserves. So while our reported net income was down 3% year-over-year, adjusting for the reserve change, our net income would have been 23% higher on a year-over-year basis. Let's review the details starting on Slide 5. Net interest income was up $584 million year-over-year or 24%. Our net interest margin expanded, benefiting from the higher prime rate partially offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional balances. NIM ended the quarter at 11.27%, up 46 basis points from the prior year and 22 basis points sequentially. For the full year, NIM was 11.04%, up 28 basis points from the prior year. Receivable growth was driven by card which increased 21% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong sales, new account growth and payment rate moderation. Sales increased 8% in the period, a deceleration from the 15% growth we experienced in the prior quarter and the 20% in the first half of the year. New card accounts grew by 17% from last year's fourth quarter. Similar to the prior quarter, the sales growth decline was mitigated by a decrease in the payment rate, which fell 150 basis points in the quarter. We expect payment rates to continue to decline through 2023, but at a more moderate pace. Turning to our non-card products. Organic student loans increased 4% as a result of peak season originations. Personal loans were up 15%. We continue to stay disciplined in our approach to marketing, underwriting and pricing of this product. Our attractive value proposition has positioned us well in the market that is experiencing strong consumer demand and some improvement in competitive conditions. In terms of funding mix, our customer deposit balances were up 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Deposit pricing continues to be in line with what we expected in a rising rate environment. Recently, we have seen some moderation in the pace of pricing changes. Looking at other revenue on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased $212 million or 47%. This was partially due to a $138 million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter, compared to a $6 million loss this quarter. Adjusting for these, our non-interest income was up 14%. This increase was primarily driven by two items. First, loan fee income was up $51 million or 39%, driven by volume. And second, we had higher net discount and interchange revenue, which was up $23 million or 7% reflecting strong sales and a favorable sales mix, partially offset by higher rewards costs. Moving to expenses on Slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $183 million or 14% year-over-year and up 8% from the prior quarter. Compensation costs were up primarily due to increased headcount and wage inflation. Marketing expenses increased $42 million or 15% as we continue to prudently invest for growth in our card in consumer banking products. Premise and equipment expense was elevated this quarter due to a onetime write-off related to the exit of our Phoenix servicing location. Adjusting for this, premise and equipment would have been flat to the prior year quarter. With this recent action, we have resized or exited three of our four major call center locations, and we'll continue to evaluate our footprint going forward. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 2.13%, 76 basis points higher than the prior year and up 42 basis points from the prior quarter. In the card portfolio, the net charge-off rate of 2.37% was 87 basis points higher than the prior year and 45 basis points higher sequentially. As expected, portfolio loss rates are normalizing, reflecting seasoning of new account vintages from the past two years, normalization of older vintages and mild deterioration and low credit bands, largely inflation-driven. These trends are within our expected risk tolerances and are consistent with our historical approach to underwriting and credit management. Among our core prime revolver segment, we don't see evidence of broader stress given the robust labor market. I'll cover our 2023 view in a moment. Turning to the discussions of our allowance on Slide 9. This quarter, we increased our allowance by $313 million driven by the increase in receivable balances. Our reserve rate declined slightly to 6.6%. Adjusting for the elevated level of transactor balances in the fourth quarter, our reserve rate would have been near sequentially flat. Under the CECL accounting standard, we are required to contemplate life of loan losses and adjust our reserve levels accordingly. For us, the changes to employment conditions pose the most significant risk to our forecast. For the year-end 2022 reserve, our baseline assumption was unemployment in 2023 between 4.5% and 6.5% and with alternative scenarios above 6%. Looking at Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 13.3%. Our longer-term target remains at 10.5%. We expect to make progress against this target over the next four to six quarters. Yesterday, we announced a quarterly common dividend of $0.60 per share. And in the fourth quarter of 2022, we repurchased $602 million of common stock. Concluding on Slide 11 with our outlook. Momentum is strong, which should help to generate double-digit revenue growth and positive operating leverage. We expect end-of-period loan growth to be in the low double digits with average loan growth somewhat higher. This is driven by three factors : our prior year growth in new accounts moderation in the payment rate and sales volume trends. Through mid-January, sales are up 13%, but we expect deceleration to the high single digits over the course of the year. We expect net interest margin to be modestly higher than the full year 2022 levels. More specifically, we expect NIM to be above the fourth quarter levels in the first half of the year driven by continued loan re-pricing benefits and decline in the second half. We are looking for total operating expenses to increase less than 10%. Salary and benefit expense will increase due to hiring in the second half of 2022. Additionally, we expect marketing to be above our full year 2022 level. We expect net charge-offs will average between 3.5% and 3.9% for the full year. The low end of the range is more in line with our base case, while the high end is more consistent with a weaker employment scenario. Lastly, we have $2.8 billion of remaining capacity under the $4.2 billion share repurchase program that expires in June of this year. We expect to repurchase around $2.2 billion of shares in the first half of 2023. We'll provide an update on future share repurchase authorizations after we complete our stress testing process and review recommendations with our Board. In summary, receivable growth continued to benefit from new account acquisition, payment rate moderation and positive sales. NIM continues to benefit from prime rate increases with funding costs consistent with expectations and credit is performing in line with our approach through-the-cycle underwriting process and conservative credit management. Our perspectives for 2023 reflect our focus on advancing our strategic priorities generating high returns and capital while remaining disciplined in our credit and expense management. With that, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. And John, thanks for kind of outlining the parameters of the range of expected credit loss. But could you talk a little bit about the past kind of from here to getting to the 3.5%? Like what either has to happen that's bad or not happen, that's good. And at what points along that way, would you know whether that 3.5% base case is too high or too low? John Greene : Yes. Great. Yes. Thanks for the question, Moshe. So the range is some unlocked, right? 3.5% to 3.9% for '23. And -- we certainly have a great deal of visibility through the first six months of the year through a roll rate methodology. Post six months, so in the second half of the year, we use our analytical models which anticipate a number of different possible outcomes but used as historical data that's been tested significantly to make a projection of what we expect to happen. So as we get through the first quarter, we'll be able to see what's happening with our roll rates in terms of is it a roll to one bucket and the roll to two bucket, consistent with our expectations on the base case on the reserve. Beyond that, we'll certainly look at the macro environment and what's happening with unemployment levels and the overall job market. That will give us some perspective. And then an important component of this, and I know there was some questions in terms of the step-up from where we ended '22 to where we're projecting '23. We have fairly significant vintages that are going through the normal seasoning process right now. So for example, our end-of-period card portfolio, so last year 12/31 to this year 12/31 increased by $15.7 billion. And if you think about kind of a maturity cycle of a credit card, typically within the first year to two years, you hit peak losses. So that is some of what we're expecting here, and therefore, the guidance that we've provided. We do expect that in a stable macroeconomic environment, in the second half of the year, we should see this slope of the curve begin to bend down a little bit with perhaps top losses coming through in '24 and then returning down. So overall, what we're seeing here is just a strong portfolio, very significant vintages that came through in '21 and '22 that are seasoning at levels that were -- that are completely within our expectation of total return thresholds. And then, we'll see the overall portfolio normalized. So hopefully, that provides some clarity on both the trajectory as well as what we're seeing in the portfolio. Moshe Orenbuch : Perfect. And just as a follow-up, the reserve rate was down. You mentioned that was largely a result of transactor balances. But I guess even with that, it wasn't up. And so when you think about that, kind of how do you -- I mean, how should we think -- it doesn't feel like you're anticipating a deteriorating environment if you're keeping your reserve certainly no worse than flat. And how do we think about that going through '23 as well? John Greene : Yes, great question. And they're connected, so happy to cover them in the same set. So CECL reflects life of loan losses as we all know, right? And so, what drives that is the portfolio performance and the -- our view of the macroeconomic environment today and going forward. And we haven't had any substantial changes to the macroeconomic environment. And essentially, the portfolio is performing within our expected ranges of outcomes. So, as we look at the fourth quarter receivable balances in the aggregate, and the portfolio performance, a stable macro, we felt most appropriate reserve levels would be fairly consistent with what we did in the third quarter. And essentially, without taking you through a ton of detail that the teams spend weeks and weeks working through, that's essentially how we arrived at the answer. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Maybe just a follow-up question to the credit questions Moshe asked. John, you talked about the seasoning. Is there any way to parse apart the impact of seasoning in your range versus the actual degradation as a result of just the deteriorating delinquencies on a base case? And then you mentioned sort of the slope of the curve decelerates, I think you said in the second half, but I just want to make sure to understand sort of how the seasoning will impact us for the next two years. Does it still weigh in on you in the first half of 2024? John Greene : Yes. So in terms of the impact of the vintages, I explicitly called out the card vintage in 2022, so the $15.7 billion to give the folks that are listening here, a place to anchor on in terms of thinking about the vintage and then you can run out peak losses for our portfolio in terms of what typically happens after a significant vintage and in a stable macro. So that should help you at least in terms of the thinking in terms of the vintage. As we think about this year, we gave that range of 3.5% to 3.9% on the loan base -- on the average loan base. So you should think about the ultimate kind of range here. It will depend first on the macro. Second, we'll continue to give updates in each of the quarters in terms of what we're seeing. But ultimately, we expect this vintage will mature in 2024. And then, we should see in a stable macro, the curve not only slope pending, but actually inverting slightly. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Follow-up question on loan growth. Obviously, you mentioned the strong growth driving the seasoning, but you guys are still expecting double-digit growth in the face of maybe a tougher economic backdrop. What gives you the comfort here? Maybe Roger, speaking to the growth in the past, and I know every cycle takes on a different complexion. What are you guys looking at that makes you comfortable to grow here? Because that's a question I get quite a bit from investors. Roger Hochschild : Yes. Good question, Sanjay. I think you've seen us operate this business through multiple cycles and the disciplined approach we take both in good times as well as in bad. And frequently, the accounts that you put on during a challenging economic time, perform extraordinarily well, and you can see very good cost per account as competitors pull back. So, we have been pretty clear at that starting in the back half of last year, we started tightening credit standards, and you can expect us to continue to look at that and adjust according to economic conditions, both for new accounts as well as the portfolio. Nevertheless, we're seeing great returns on the marketing investments we're putting out there. And so, that's what gives us the confidence to keep investing in growth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : And not to beat the dead horse, but maybe just one more question on the kind of the provisioning and the credit. John, I think you kind of detailed the unemployment assumptions. I think they were kind of in the 4.5% to 6% range with maybe somewhere making the 5% range, kind of the middle of the fairway. Just maybe can you tell us what's the sensitivity for the -- either the charge-offs or the ALL at say unemployment moves to level like 100 basis points higher than that. John Greene : Yes. So in our kind of primary case here, we assumed a 100 basis points increase in unemployment. Now that that was specific to our charge-off forecast. In terms of kind of reserve levels, we actually used a composite of multiple scenarios. The more heavily weighted scenario reflected a loss rate of 4.5% and then going up all the way to 6%. So, I'm feeling actually like we're down the middle here in terms of appropriateness in terms of overall reserve levels and more specificity in terms of sensitivity. I don't think that would be a service given if we're seeing unemployment kind of creep up in that sort of matter or that sort of quantum that would indicate that the macro environment has changed, and we have to change our view on that, which could change our perspectives on life of loan losses. John Hecht : Okay. That's helpful. And then you gave annual guidance with NIM, and it sounds like maybe an elevated NIM in the first part of the year coming down second, what are the drivers of that with respect to the yield and the cost of capital? John Greene : Yes. Yes. So I'm going to run through the primary drivers. So first would be the Fed rate changes in the second half of '22 as well as what we've anticipated either two or three increases in 2023. Second impact is the yield on our investments, which is improving with the increase in the rate environment. And then, the third piece has been some pricing actions we took in the consumer banking products. So, think about the non-card products. So offsetting that would be kind of the cost of funding. So DTC and external funding costs have increased. And then we're also anticipating an impact from credit, all of which the net of those gives us a high level of confidence that certainly, we're going to see peak NIM in the first quarter and then stepping down from there through 2023. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Mark DeVries : I have one more credit question for you. I know you don't generally give out guidance more than one year out, but I think some of the commentary around the charge-off guidance has some implications for 2024. I just wanted to try and clarify I mean if you look at the guidance range, it seems to imply you kind of exit 2023 at a charge-off rate at 4% to 4.5%. I think, John, you indicated 2024 is kind of a peak year? Should we expect -- is it reasonable to assume that that's implying kind of a charge-off rate north of 4% for 2024? John Greene : Yes. So you were right on your call here. We gave a range for 2023 of 3.5% to 3.9%. I talked about the curve and what we think will happen to the curve and the slope of that. So, Mark, as a matter of prudence, I think that's probably as far as I'm going to go here. Mark DeVries : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for that color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Maybe a slightly different way to address this question is you perhaps could give us some color on where you have seen your fully seasoned vintages peak in terms of net charge-off rates and around what kind of month within the seasoning path that happens in a range of months that would be helpful to understand. John Greene : Yes. So typically, we'll see it around 18 months. And it varies based on credit quality. So, the highest credit quality. So, I think FICO would typically peak a little later. And then the weaker, I'll say, the weaker credits typically peak a little bit earlier. But on average, I think, about 18 months or so. Betsy Graseck : And the level that you've been seeing, it would be helpful to understand how historically, the vintages that you want to write to are trajecting in terms of peak. And maybe if you could comp 2022 vintage in 2021, what you're seeing there would be helpful? John Greene : Yes. So -- the first part of that answer would be it would depend on the vintage. So if you go back to our 2020 vintage and remember, there's COVID, right, we were locked down. We ceased underwriting kind of the near prime and lower prime and concentrated on upper prime that vintage will season at a peak loss level below what Discover historically has done. If you look at '21, '22, we were essentially back to an underwriting standard consistent with history. And you can use that information to get some level of comfort around what can be expected in '24 on this vintage. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Because you're basically saying '22 is a normal -- is exhibiting behavior that is more normal pre-COVID type of vintages? John Greene : It is. Yes. Yes. The one difference that I think is important for folks to codify in their minds is that we're coming off an abnormally low base, right? So the entire portfolio is normalizing. We've talked about that consistently actually, since the beginning of last year that we thought the portfolio was normalizing. And what you're seeing here in the 2023 guidance is essentially the portfolio normalizing. Betsy Graseck : The current reserve ratio level is consistent with this normalization whereby peak losses hit in '24? John Greene : Yes. Otherwise, my controller would have taken an exception to our reserve process. Betsy Graseck : Right. And this is -- I know we're talking about card, but is this the same kind of expectation across the other asset classes as well, student and personnel? John Greene : Yes. Although what we're seeing in personal loans is, again, loss rates below historical norms. Payment rate is beginning to normalize. And we had talked about the fact that we perhaps overcorrected on that product in terms of underwriting, in terms of the pullback. We pulled back significantly. So I expect some seasoning and normalization there. But again, we're very, very confident about the loss performance of that product. We understand where it is on the payment priorities for folks. So we're going to be mindful of the economy on that. And student loans, yes, that's normalizing. We did have and likely we'll have a little bit of impact when we see the full impact of the student debtors on the government programs having to pay back loans, but it's underwritten to a high standard. 80-plus percent have cosigners. So, we feel very comfortable about that product as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Rick Shane : Look, this is an interesting milestone where the reserve rate is 658 basis points. It basically is apples-to-apples seasonality versus CECL day one and up 50 basis points. I'm curious when we think about your economic outlook and how you build a CECL reserve where you compare to CECL day one on a like-for-like basis, would you build the same allowance? Or have you made adjustments and then compare your economic outlooks in each of those points in time, please? John Greene : Yes. So good question, Rick. So we've referenced CECL day one in the past, but I'd like to remind folks, day one was first time we rolled this new standard out. We were using new models. They've been tested extensively. And the macros were late cycle with higher unemployment levels. So as we look at kind of where we are today or as of the fourth quarter, right, 6.58 in terms of total loss reserve rate. That seems appropriate based on kind of what we're seeing in the macros and how the portfolio is performing. So, do we specifically reference day one only from the standpoint of where it was back on January 1, 2020, to where it is today, but we don't use that as a decision point whatsoever. Rick Shane : John understood. I'm more curious that if you like were you've described that the models have evolved. And I think that, that's fair, and I think everybody appreciates that. What I'm asking is, on a like-for-like basis, would -- do you think that reserve rates are lower today using the same assumptions as you refine them versus CECL day one? John Greene : Yes. No, no, they're not lower. We're looking at the portfolio performance. It's performed extraordinarily well. We're seeing a bit of seasoning now, as you would expect in this type of product. And the macros are contemplating a minimum level of increase in unemployment of at least 0.5% and more likely 1%. So what you're seeing here is a CECL reserve for the quarter that reflects those macros. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Bob Napoli : Many -- some commentary, Roger, on the competitive environment for rewards. I mean, you've seen very strong growth out of a number of players in the industry, including yourselves. Can you -- are you seeing more competition? Where are you seeing more competition, more people getting more aggressive, if you would? Roger Hochschild : Yes. Thanks Bob. It remains, I would say, intensely competitive. But as you've seen from the growth and especially the performance in new accounts, our value proposition is competing well. And again, I want to give credit to some of the advancements on the analytics that let us sort of personalize the marketing messages across different channels. I guess where competition has lightened a bit is in the personal loan space. I think there are a lot of non-bank funded folks there who may have some challenges on the other side of the balance sheet. And obviously, one big player who had been active is pulling out. On the deposit side, I would see there, I think you're starting to see the gap between the direct banks, the branch banks really get wide enough that you're seeing flows to the direct system, right? It's now at 3.3% for a savings rate. It's now a lot more worth your money. So again, really excited about how our products are competing across every segment. And so that's part of why we're optimistic going into 2023. Bob Napoli : What new products, I mean your cash-back debit is something that you've talked about? What new products are you most excited about? Roger Hochschild : You're highlighting probably the big launch for next year, which will be the re-launch of cash-back debit and we hope to be doing some mass-market advertising of that. Beyond that, I really believe we have the right product set. We're seeing great demand, for example, on the home equity side, given how rates have moved and the lack of cash-out refi. So I think part of how we keep our costs as low as they are, is a very simple, lean operating model. So I wouldn't expect anything other than the re-launch of the cash-back debit and we'll put a lot of weight behind that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Back to the credit topic, anything about the charge-off guidance that baked into your guidance, that is a surprise at all in terms of what you're observing. I know you talked about the seasoning and the vintages and it sounds like there's nothing there that really surprised you. But I'm wondering, anything about the credit migration within the vintages, within the portfolio in the past dues and/or customer behavior that surprised you that led to the increase in the charge-off guidance that seems to be well above where The Street was expecting? John Greene : Yes. Thanks, John. Actually, no surprises in the portfolio performance whatsoever, and I want to reiterate that. And that's essentially why the reserve rate is flat, right? So, they are connected. So what that says is that charge-off guidance was essentially contemplated in the reserving of life of loan losses. So, we feel very good about that and there is consistency. I did talk about in my prepared remarks that the lowest end of the credit spectrum that we have in our portfolio. So some near-prime and some folks without FICO scores or those who fell below 660 are certainly feeling the impact from inflation. But internally, we completely anticipated that we had run some analysis on inflation shocks and what it would do to some of the card members, and it's performing essentially where we thought it would come out. So I'm actually quite pleased about that. The other important thing that I want to make sure that the audience here is I think what 2022 did for us is it increased the earnings power of the firm. And there's a lot of focus from these questions on kind of the charge-off and peak good assets consistent with what we've done historically. So loans increased $18 billion. So, there's going to be some seasoning, but overall, the earnings power of the firm has increased as a result of great execution by our teams. John Pancari : Okay. That's helpful. And then, again, just -- I know this gets to CECL and the whole spirit of it. But given your commentary and that you just indicated reserve flat, so if the macro outlook progresses within your scenarios and the loss migration progresses as you described here into 2024 of this 2022 vintage, and no other surprises elsewhere, then would you expect accordingly that the reserve at 660 would generally remain around that level in that case? Or could there be incremental upside to the reserve, assuming that macro backdrop remains as they're within the scenario bands. John Greene : Yes. So, there's -- I appreciate the question. A lot of assumptions in there, but as you laid out, I would expect the overall reserve rates to be relatively close to kind of where they are today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : First, I wanted to ask if you could give us a sense of what kind of delinquency rates you'd expect based on that 3.5% to 3.9% NCO rate outlook? John Greene : Yes. I mean we don't typically forecast the delinquency rates. You would -- what I suggest you do is take a look at the trust data and the relative difference between the trust data historically and where the total company is coming out, that will give some insights. And then also, the trends in delinquencies typically are pretty consistent, right? You can go point to point to point. And then I've given some views in terms of where we see the slope starting to flatten and then perhaps spend. So, I'd use that information in order to -- if you're interested in calculating overall delinquency rates for firm. Bill Carcache : Okay. That's helpful. I guess just the spirit of the question was, there isn't anything unique happening with that increase in charge-offs that would lead to a breakdown between the historical relationship that exists between delinquencies and charge-offs. In other words, the sharp increase that you're expecting in delinquencies -- or sorry, in charge-offs, it would be reasonable to expect sort of a commensurate sharp increase in delinquencies as the data start to come through? John Greene : Yes, there obviously, a relationship there, certainly. Although remember, you should have -- you should take into account the kind of the vintage impact and what I'll say normal seasoning, right? So, there's $18 billion of incremental loans. Some of those are just going to perform extremely well and a small percentage will season, out as we typically see. So, I would consider that in the analysis, but nothing at it. There should be no substantial break. Bill Carcache : Okay. And my follow-up is, if I may, I might have missed this, but why did an increase in early-stage delinquencies drive higher credit card NCO rates this quarter. Is my initial thought was that early stage delinquencies would have to flow through the various delinquency buckets before charging off? So what was it following how that early stage increase this quarter impacted NCOs? Just a clarification there would be great. John Greene : Yes. Yes. Well, there's a couple of different components, right? There is -- there's a bankruptcy bucket. There's a non-bankruptcy bucket that just flows through the buckets. And then there's also the recovery element. So if you put those three together, sometimes the bankruptcy bucket is it will pop in a particular quarter, depending on flow of work in the court system and the non-bankruptcy just flows quarter-over-quarter. So, I would certainly look at this quarter, prior quarter and what comes out in the first quarter, and that will be the insights you're looking for. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : I wanted to just talk a little bit more about credit. So specifically, I think you mentioned a little bit of mild deterioration in credit among the lower bands. Does your guidance contemplate that stress spreading to your prime core revolver portfolio at all as unemployment increases, I guess said differently, what I'm trying to understand is, do you think we go from credit formalization to deterioration for DFS overall? Or is it just normalization with just the vintage seasoning impacts that we've been talking about? John Greene : Yes. Thank you. It's the latter. It is normalization and seasoning, which we contemplated fully in both our kind of origination strategy, our reserving strategy and obviously in the guidance we're providing. Roger Hochschild : Yes. And maybe just to clarify, the lowest income segments which are a pretty small portion of our base are the ones that get additional pressure from inflation, right? By and large, a prime book can adjust. They trade down, they readjust their pattern. So I think John was referring to incremental stress there. But there's no reason to believe that the vast majority of our portfolio will be driven by the traditional drivers of losses, which is charge-offs -- I'm sorry, which is unemployment. Mihir Bhatia : Got it. And then, I did want to offer maybe a little bit of a big picture question, just longer term. I think -- we appreciate that you have added a lot of business and increase the earnings power because some of these assets will obviously last a long time past the vintage seasoning. But the portfolio has changed a lot and your guidance for the next year and it sounds like potentially even '24 is a little bit above where credit losses have been running. So maybe just remind us, what is the normal loss rate for DFS or for the card portfolio or something like that? Maybe give us a range. Just trying to understand where a typical portfolio settles out? Is it in that 3%, low 3% range where does that settle up? John Greene : Yes. Thanks, Mihir. So -- we've been asked that question over the years many, many times. And what I typically refer people back to is, if you take a look at the details of the kind of the charge-off history, you can go back through 2008. And see kind of quarter-over-quarter what's happening on the charge-off front, you can discern kind of normalized charge-off rate from that and then make adjustments for economic periods or kind of vintage-based seasoning. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Kevin Barker : And in regards to your employment forecast and your base assumptions, you're pretty clear that the low end, the 3.5% assumes the 4.5% to 5% unemployment rate. But can you help us understand or just confirm that the -- is it the 3.9% higher end of the range, implying a 6% unemployment rate or some other scenario out there within your expectations? John Greene : Yes. So the high end does not weight the 6% entirely. It actually could reflect a scenario with unemployment is actually higher than the 6%, but it would depend on the depth of it and kind of what industry. So, there's multiple scenarios in there. So, the guidance I provided in terms of 4.5% or over 6% is intended to kind of get the kind of the meat of the scenarios that were contemplated and weighted. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then with your baseline assumption of 4.5% to 5%, is that something that we make our way to throughout the year and then maintain that level or something where you expected to peak there and then startly drift lower? John Greene : Yes. So it would run through slowly increase through 2023 and how we've thought about it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Can you dig in a little bit more on the credit card spend growth rate and kind of what you're seeing in terms of any pattern changes. I think the last update through November showed a little bit of a step-down in the growth rate. And can you talk about December and I think maybe you touched on January? Roger Hochschild : Yes. I'll start. January is off to a very strong start. So, we're seeing about a 13% year-over-year growth in sales, and again, reflects the new accounts we put on last year, but also, again, for those who aren't employed a robust environment. We have been seeing increases in the day-to-day category commensurate with inflation and so more spending shifting there. And a lot of what you heard from retailers in terms of softness around home improvement, and hard goods, but a lot of that was just, I think, some of the challenging comparisons to really robust levels from before. So, overall, I'd say, stable, but we're certainly encouraged by what we're seeing so far in January. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Arren Cyganovich : On the marketing outlook, you had indicated that you expect to spend more than 2022 levels, which obviously was a very strong acquisition year for you. What's the thought process there in terms of expecting to increase spend after such a strong year? John Greene : Yes, great question. And you know what, I'm going to hit kind of give an overview on expenses and now I'll specifically talk about kind of marketing and our thinking there. So, we said overall expenses would increase some less than 10%. So, what that contemplates is a double-digit increase in marketing and single digits for the non-marketing spend. And what that reflects is, we continue to see opportunities to acquire profitable new accounts that are consistent with what we do. So that -- in that prime revolver category. We also are intending to spend some money on the launch of the debit checking product. So that will include dollars for new accounts as well as advertising to bring awareness to the product. And then, it's important to also kind of have a view on the marketing in that this is our guidance. If we see the macroeconomic environment change or we don't see ample opportunity to spend this money wisely then we will make calls in terms of the level of spend, and it could be less than what's -- what we've guided to. But overall, we're very, very pleased with kind of our targeting and the effectiveness of the marketing and gave us confidence to continue to increase that. Arren Cyganovich : And then on the personal loan side, you had indicated that it's -- it's clear that it's performing better than historically. With respect to the guidance, does the personal loan net charge-off rate, is that expected to go as high as credit cards in 2023? Or are you still expecting it to be somewhat better? John Greene : Yes. I'm going to stick at the top level of the guidance we provided. And then, we give details by product in the supplement. I would use that information and impute kind of the charge-off rate there. But again, product has been performing very, very well, loss rates significantly below kind of what's happening out in the industry. And it's a kind of a -- it's a prime customer set. So that should give a view of kind of at least a way to think about expectations for that product. Eric Wasserstrom : So, I think we're going to conclude our call there. Any additional questions, please reach out to the IR team, and thanks very much for joining us this morning. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2023 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you, Chelsea, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin on slide two of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our first quarter earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, you\u2019ll be permitted to ask one question followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up questions, please return to the queue. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thanks, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'll begin by commenting on some of the recent events in the banking industry, review our highlights for the quarter, and then John will take you through the details of our first quarter results and our updated perspectives on 2023. This past quarter include the failure of two large banks, an event that catalyzed more widespread stress in some segments of the banking system and raised questions about the funding models and embedded portfolio losses of multiple banks. In contrast, our strong results underscore how our model, with its diversified funding, trusted brand, focus on prime consumer lending and conservative risk management positions us to succeed through a range of operating conditions. I want to call out a few results in particular that highlight our performance in this challenging environment. We reported first quarter net income of $1 billion or $3.58 per share. We had an all-time record quarter in terms of consumer deposit inflows, leveraging our award-winning digital experience and our leading customer service, and we're improving key elements of our guidance. As we look to the remainder of 2023, we may adjust our outlook as conditions evolve. We believe there is the potential for more stringent regulation. We believe we're well positioned for more rigorous regulatory capital and liquidity requirements given our strong internal standards, and we also continue to focus on enhancing our compliance management systems. This past quarter also included an important milestone with respect to our investment in human capital. We're honored to have been recognized as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work for in 2023. This is the first time we've earned this distinction and it builds upon recognition we received last year, ranking us among the best workplaces for parents and Fortune's best workplaces for women. In conclusion, we believe our earnings power, balance sheet strength, investments in people and advancements and capabilities support our strategy of becoming the leading consumer digital bank. I'll now turn the call over to John to review our results in more detail. John Greene : Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary results on slide four. Our performance this quarter was characterized by strong revenue growth, continued credit normalization, a slight change to our outlook on the macroeconomic environment, resulting in a reserve increase, and a year-over-year increase in expenses. Let's review the details starting on slide five. Net interest income was up $653 million year-over-year or 26%. Our net interest margin continued to expand, benefiting from higher prime rates, partially offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional balances. NIM ended the quarter at 11.34%, up 49 basis points from the prior year and seven basis points sequentially. Receivable growth was driven by card, which increased 22% year-over-year, reflecting stable sales growth, modest new account growth, and payment rate moderation. Sales increased 9% in the period, slightly higher than the 8% growth we experienced in the prior quarter and down from the 16% growth we experienced in 2022. Sales growth so far in April is a modest 2.5% but this is coming off a very high comp of 22% in April of last year. New card account growth decelerated, reflecting the tightening of underwriting standards over the past several months, but grew by 3% from the prior year. The impact of slowing sales growth on receivable expansion was offset by decreases in payment rates. The card payment rate decreased 80 basis points in the quarter and is currently slightly over 200 basis points above the pre-pandemic level. Turning to our non-card products. Personal loans were up 21%, driven by higher originations over the past year and lower payment rates. We continue to experience strong consumer demand, while staying disciplined in our underwriting of this product. Organic student loan receivables grew by 3%, largely driven by a reduction in the payment rate. In terms of funding mix, consumer deposit balances were up 17% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. As Roger highlighted, we achieved record quarterly deposit growth. Deposits now make up 66% of our total funding mix with over 90% insured and we continue to target 70% to 80% deposit funding over the medium term. Outside of deposits, our funding channels remain open and at attractive costs. As an example, in early April, we issued $1.25 billion of card ABS fixed rate notes. This offering was upsized and our spread was nine basis points tighter than our November securitization. Additionally, we recently received a ratings upgrade by Moody's for our bank subsidiary and our banking holding company. Moody's cited a number of reasons to support this upgrade, including our prudent underwriting, conservative risk management, and resiliency in an economic downturn. Looking at other revenue on slide six. Non-interest income increased $198 million or 47%. This was partially due to a $162 million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter compared to an $18 million loss this quarter. Adjusting for these, our non-interest income was up 9%, primarily driven by the loan fee income and higher net discount and interchange revenue. Moving to expenses on slide seven. Total operating expenses were up $253 million, or 22% year-over-year and down 7% from the prior quarter. Compensation costs were up primarily due to increased headcount and wage inflation. Marketing expenses increased $49 million, or 26% as we continue to prudently invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products. Professional fees increased $55 million, or 31%, driven by investments in technology and increases and consulting activities that support our consumer compliance initiatives. Even with these increases, our efficiency ratio was 37%, and we generated about 700 basis points of operating leverage in the period. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 2.72%, 111 basis points higher than the prior year and up 59 basis points from the prior quarter. In the card portfolio, the net charge-off rate of 3.1% was 126 basis points higher than the prior year and 73 basis points higher sequentially. Consistent with our commentary back in January, we expect the seasoning of new account vintages from the past two years and normalization of older vintages to a more typical loss rate. These trends remain consistent with our expectations. Turning to the discussion of our allowance on Slide 9. This quarter, we increased our allowance by $385 million, and our reserve rate increased by 25 basis points to 6.8%. This increase in reserve rate was driven by two factors. About 10 basis points reflects the runoff of seasonal transactor balances that we typically experienced in the fourth quarter. The remaining portion was largely driven by deterioration in our expectations of the macroeconomic environment. We increased our expectations for the 2023 year-end employment rate to the midpoint of our 4.5% to 5% range. This change reflects the potential for a reduction in lending impacting economic growth. We will continue to monitor the macroeconomic conditions and make adjustments to our expectations. Looking at Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 12.3%, and we repurchased $1.2 billion of common stock during the quarter. The net unrealized loss on our AFS securities portfolio at the end of the quarter was $45 million. The impact on our regulatory capital, if our OCI opt-out were not allowed would have been about 20 basis points. Our capital position remains robust and well ahead of regulatory requirements. We continue to prioritize investment in strong organic growth and returning excess capital to shareholders. Included in our press release was the announcement that our Board of Directors approved a new $2.7 billion share repurchase program for the five quarters ending June 2024 and increased our common stock dividend by 17% to $0.70 per share. Including on Slide 11 with our outlook. Following the strong first quarter performance, we are raising our expectations for loan growth this year to be low to mid-teens. There is no change to our NIM forecast. We are maintaining our guidance for operating expenses to be less than 10%. However, we do see risk of upward pressure on this from collection and customer service expense related to growth in our lending and deposit accounts and professional service support and continued investment in technology. We are targeting our expected range of net charge-offs to 3.5% to 3.8% based on our current delinquencies and roll rates. This represents a reduction to the top end of the range by 10 basis points. Finally, as mentioned, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization. We have returned substantial excess capital over the past two years, and we anticipate moving towards a more standard cadence of share buybacks over the second half of this year. To conclude, our first quarter results have given us significant momentum into this year, and we're well positioned to deliver on our financial objectives. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Good morning. John, quick question on the reserve commentary you had. Just to be clear, I know you guys had a weighting of scenarios. And it sounds like the low end went from 4.5% to 4.75%. When we average that out, between all the scenarios, does that take you above the 5% unemployment rate assumption, or how should we think about that? And also just in terms of the narrowing of the range of the charge-offs this quarter, was that more because the unemployment rate hasn't necessarily panned out the way you expected it to, meaning it's coming in better? John Greene : Yes. Thanks, Sanjay. Yes, I'll start with the reserve portion of the question and then swing over to the charge-off aspect. So as we mentioned, we ran a number of different scenarios. So we looked at unemployment ranges from 3.5% to north of 6%. We centered around a range between 4.5% and 5% for 2023 and then a slight improvement in 2024. And that was essentially the driver of the increase in the reserve rate outside of the 10 basis points I talked about in my prepared remarks related to kind of transactors running off as they typically do in the first quarter. So hopefully, that clarifies your question or clarify any questions you have on reserves. Related to charge-offs, so there's a couple of factors there. The first and what I would say is the most important is that the portfolio is performing almost exactly as we expected it to in terms of charge-off, roll rates and delinquencies. So we're generally pleased with that. As each month and quarter goes by, we have better line of sight to what we expect the total year to be. Our internal kind of roll rate models basically can take a very, very good look at six months forward, and then we move to more advanced models for anything beyond that. So as the first quarter passed through great line of sight through September. And then beyond September, we've relied on our analytical models. So that's essentially the reason why we're able to tighten the charge-off guidance from the upper end. And each quarter, we'll give an update on that certainly. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. I guess, first, you talked about kind of slowing of new account growth. Could you kind of, Roger, perhaps drill down a little more into that the drivers, I guess, in terms of what you're seeing either in the competitive environment or in the consumer kind of credit environment? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. So I'll start the credit -- the competitive environment remains robust, right? Most of our key competitors in the card business are the larger money center banks, well capitalized, a lot of deposits. So card's tends to always be competitive. I think what you're seeing are the results of some of the changes we've made in credit policy. We've talked about tightening at the margin. And then also some very tough comps over the growth we saw last year. So we feel really good about the new accounts we're booking, but also believe our credit policy is appropriate for the current environment. Moshe Orenbuch : Got it. And maybe can you talk, John, maybe talk a little bit more about the expense comment that you made, how much of that would be tied to revenue growth if expenses were higher. John Greene : Yeah. So as I said in the prepared remarks, we we've maintained a less than 10% guidance, although we're seeing a little bit of pressure on those lines I mentioned. So in terms of marketing, what we said in January was that we expected marketing to be up double digits. We still expect that to be the case despite the reduction in the rate of growth of new accounts, we are still seeing good opportunities to generate positive account growth with an appropriate risk tolerance. The other portion of that marketing spend will be to roll out the -- the cash back debit program, which we anticipate to be rolled out late in the second quarter, maybe early in the third quarter. So we're going to put some substantial dollars behind that to generate some activity, both new account generation as well as awareness of the product and the product features that we think will help build -- continue to build our strong deposit franchise. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open. Bob Napoli : Yeah. Thank you, and good morning. The slowdown in spend growth that you called out in the month of April. I was wondering if you could give -- I know it's tough comps versus a year ago. But just any color on what you're seeing on that front? And then any change in your view of the health of the consumer? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. So I would say that, the slowdown is pretty broad-based. And is really a continuation of the trend. If you look at the quarter itself, overall sales growth was a little over 9%. But March, it had dropped to 4%. So broad-based across all categories, I think some of it is just a reduction in the pressures from inflation. But also you've got some tough comps in terms of last April, sales were up 22% year-over-year. For us, the most important thing for the consumers, the strength of the job market, and that remains pretty robust. So while we are tightening credit and continuing along that, overall, the consumer is still holding up pretty well. Bob Napoli : Thank you. Then just any more color on the Cashback Debit product and what do you believe that will, I guess, do for you strategically? Just any thoughts on -- I know you guys have been doing a lot of work on it over the years, and it seems like you're ready to really roll with it. Roger Hochschild : Yeah. No, that -- it's a product we're really excited about. Offering 1% cash back on debit transactions is virtually unique. It's something that no big bank can match. We take advantage of having a proprietary payments network. And one of the outcomes from the pandemic is consumers even for their primary checking or debit account are a lot more comfortable dealing with the direct bank. So this is going to be a critical initiative, not just for this year, but for many years to come. And part of our transition to being way more than credit cards, first loans, student loans, home equity, but being the true leading digital bank. Bob Napoli : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Rick Shane : Thanks everybody for taking my questions this morning. Roger, when you look at the credit outlook and you updated the NCO guidance, I'm curious about some of the puts and takes you see in terms of the internals of numbers, whether it's roll rates, utilization, payment rates. What do you see out there that is the most constructive and what's your -- what's the factor that gives you the most pause? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. It varies for new accounts versus what we look for in our portfolio. For the portfolio side, yeah, it's hard to pick an individual factor given the complexity of the models we use. But certainly, overall levels of indebtedness, their behavior in terms of payments, the amount of payment, we even look at when a payment comes in during the month. So given that we're still focused on growth, I would say, in general, the consumers are doing well, but we have continued to tighten. And it's something we look at every account, every day across all of our different products. Rick Shane : Got it. And is there one metric you might point to that kind of your -- when you get your daily reports, you scan to right away to -- because it's a concern for you? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. So you may find it hard to believe, but there are very few numbers I look at on a daily basis. I'm lucky to have an amazing team. And so I can look at it a little less frequently. But you can't point to a single number. We have a composite behavioral score that I see on a lot of our internal risk reporting. But again, there are literally countless variables in some of our most complex machine learning models that are evaluating portfolio credit. Rick Shane : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Jeff Adelson : Yes. Hi. This is Jeff Adelson on for Betsy. Good morning. John, I just wanted to follow up on the comment about the potential for a reduction in lending impacting economic growth. I know that was more of a macro overlay comment, but just wanted to understand maybe where you think Discover is going to fit into that potential tightening regime? I know you're already doing some tightening, slowing account growth on your side, but just wondering, do you see yourself at some point this year taking a more meaningful cut, maybe what would cause you to revisit the loan growth that you're seeing today? John Greene : Yes, thanks for the question, Jeff. So as we look at loan growth for 2023, we feel very, very positive, and that's why we moved the loan growth range up a bit. So in terms of the overall lending environment and what would trigger additional cuts, it would be meaningful changes to the unemployment outlook, meaningful changes in the number of job openings and then further signs of stress within the consumers. So that would -- within the portfolio itself, it would be payment rates, timing of payments. We take a look at flow rates from one bucket to another. So those would all be certainly signs as well as kind of the broader indications of delinquency and the rate of charge-off on a vintage basis. But as we look at things right now, employment, I believe, will continue to be strong, right? So we have strong growth in the health care sector, manufacturing sector, defense, oil and gas, and onshoring of supply chain continues. So my sense is that we're not going to have any seismic changes to unemployment despite the fed tightening action. So that means that we'll look at -- continue to look at things around the margins and make good calls to ensure that the accounts we're putting on are profitable. And the accounts that are in the portfolio that we have early warning triggers, so that our customer service and collection folks can reach out to ensure that collections and cash flows remain strong. Jeff Adelson : Thank you. And one follow-up I just want to have on expenses and technology investment. There's been a lot of focus out there on AI and some advances in that technology. I know Discover has been pretty nimble and investing on its own in that space. But just wondering, is there anything -- John Greene : Hello. Jeff or operator? Is the line open? Operator : Yes. His line is still open. John Greene : Okay. Eric Wasserstrom : Jeff, I think we missed the last a little bit of your question, but I think it was essentially about the use of AI. So. John Greene : Yes. So why don't I -- I'll take that briefly. And Jeff or Betsy, we can follow up separately in the afternoon, if you like. So in terms of investing in technology. So there's three -- there's, I'll call it, three or four different strengths. The first is to ensure we have leading-edge capabilities, which would include machine learning, AI. Second is ensure that our core systems are robust and resilient. And third, around the network, making sure that our network continues to have leading edge or at a minimum market global capabilities. So, those are the tiers and we continue to invest in those aspects as well as technology to support our overall compliance management system as we talked about in the prepared remarks. So, overall, it's an area of investment. We're a digital institution. We need to continue to invest in technology to ensure that we keep capabilities, advancing. Jeff Adelson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, thanks so much and good morning. I would imagine that Discover, given the prudence of the way you run your franchise has really strong KYC. And I think some of the fintech players are actually having some difficulty there. And so I'd love to hear you talk about your checklist for opening an account. And is there a difference for KYC when you issue a debit card versus extending credit with the credit card? And I just have a follow-up. Thanks so much guys. Roger Hochschild : Yes. Great question. So, AML BSA, KYC is one element of compliance. There are many others that we focus on. First thing I'd say is our task might be a little easier just given that we don't handle much cash, not having branches. We don't have huge private net worth operations, much outside the US. But it is a key area of focus, there's a pretty big overlap between what we're required to do from a KYC standpoint and actually what we do ourselves to tackle fraud. A huge amount of the new fraud attacks do come via identity theft. And while there are sort of nuanced differences by product, very, very similar in terms of what we do when someone is opening a new credit card account versus opening a checking or a debit account. Dominick Gabriele : Okay. Thanks. Thank you very much. And I guess, kind of a double question here. But is -- how closely aligned is your CECL unemployment rate and thus, reserve outlook correlated with your net charge-off guidance. Is there a possibility that, I mean, you had mentioned before that you don't expect unemployment rate to rise very much? Is there a chance that there could be actually a disconnect between the CECL reserve and company NCO outlooks? Thanks so much. John Greene : Yes, thanks Dominick. So, yes, we have a process that we take great pains to make sure there's no disconnects between our outlook on kind of charge-offs over, call it, a three-quarter or four-quarter period and the CECL reserves, which is life of loan losses, which would include charge-offs through the life of the relationship. And the modeling systems that we use are essentially the same. Same tools, same people kind of managing those and a bunch of work to ensure that the organization. So each of the functions, credit and risk management systems and finance and accounting are on the same page in terms of what we're trying to accomplish here. So there's no chance to disconnect here at Discover. I will say that the difference in terms of the tightening of our charge-off outlook in terms of updated guidance and what happened in the reserve has a couple of factors that are at play there. The first is, we're talking about a three-quarter period of forecasting on the charge-offs. And we gave a fairly wide range, which we intend to tighten as each quarter passes. On the reserves, we take a number of different factors, including the macro environment portfolio. And then there's certainly a level of management judgment that we use to ensure that we have an appropriate reserve under financial accounting standards. So that's essentially a quick sketch of the process that we use. Dominick Gabriele : Excellent. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Have a good day. John Greene : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Nate Rich [ph] on for Mihir Bhatia. Quick question for me. Are you seeing any changes to the credit quality for new applicants? I understand that you're tightening credit and underwriting. But just curious to see how those consumers are asking for loans now versus a year or two ago? Roger Hochschild : Yes. I mean it's a tricky question to answer, because it varies by channel. Obviously, we did quite a lot of pre-approved marketing. So we kind of set the criteria who applies and even within our non-pre-approved channels, we tend to be targeted. So I haven't seen, I would guess, a huge difference in terms of applicant profile, but our new account profile has tended to improve as we've tightened credit. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, can you just talk about the performance? Like how are card loan business from like 2020 or 2022 performing versus the loans pre-pandemic? Roger Hochschild : Yes. I think in general, John mentioned, all of the vintages are performing as expected. And so total losses are still normalizing in line with what we forecast. So I would say continued strong performance across the board. And we haven't seen huge differences in behavior by vintage. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Your line is open. Mark DeVries : [indiscernible] Roger Hochschild : Hey, Mark, I think your line is open. Hey, Chelsea, we'll come back to Mark offline. Operator : Okay. Yes, sir. And as at this moment, there are no further questions in the queue. So I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Well, if there are any additional questions, please reach out to us here at the IR team. And thanks very much. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference, and we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2023 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks, Todd. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in financial section of our Investor Relations website investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our second quarter earnings release and presentation. On our call today, we'll include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild and, John Green, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a Q&A session. During the Q&A session, we ask that you pose one question followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger. Roger Hochschild : Thank you, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. I'll begin by reviewing some of our highlights for the quarter and then discuss the regulatory matter that we've disclosed in our press release. John will then take you through the details of our second quarter results and our updated perspectives on 2023. Last night, we reported second quarter net income of $901 million or $3.54 per share. The quarter was characterized by strong asset and deposit growth, while credit is performing right in line with our expectations. Importantly, we advanced several operational priorities this quarter. One key milestone occurred in May when we relaunched our cash back debit product. We're excited by the positive early results we're seeing so far. In the first few weeks, we opened over 30,000 new accounts and plan to begin national marketing in support of this product in the fall. The relaunch advances our goal of becoming the leading direct bank and over time we expect cash back debit will be a significant entry point into the Discover franchise. We also continue to expand the Discover Global Network. This quarter, we announced five new partnerships in the Asia Pacific region and added a new partnership with Guavapay in the UK. These strategic partnerships underscore our commitment to building out our international acceptance. And lastly, we continue to invest in our human capital. We're honored to have been recognized as the 2023 Best Places to Work for People with Disabilities. This builds upon our recent recognitions as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For, Best Workplaces for Parents, and Best Workplaces for Women. As you may have read in our press release last night, beginning around mid-2007, we incorrectly classified certain card accounts into our highest merchant and merchant acquirer pricing tier. We are taking actions correct this card product misclassification going forward and are preparing a program to compensate affected merchants and acquirers. While the financial impacts of this misclassification are not material, it underscored deficiencies in our corporate governance and risk management. We're in discussions with our regulators regarding these matters. We have received a proposed consent order from the FDIC in connection with consumer compliance, which does not cover the misclassification topic. We believe additional supervisory actions could occur. I want to emphasize that we take our business practices and compliance very seriously. We've made significant progress and investment in this area and look forward to working with our Board and our regulators to achieve further advancement. Now I'll hand it over to John to review our results and updated outlook in more detail. John Greene : Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to open by addressing the financial implications of the card misclassification. We have established a liability on our balance sheet of $365 million to accrue for estimated compensation owed to merchant and acquirers. In establishing the liability, we adjusted retained earnings by $255 million net of tax. $11 million was taken this quarter and is reflected in discount and interchange revenue. The first half 2023 impact was $22 million. With that, I'll transition to our financial summary results on Slide 4. From this, you can see that the financial performance of the business remains solid. In the quarter, we reported net income of $901 million, which was 18% lower year-over-year. Our results reflect strong revenue growth partially offset by a provision increase driven by receivable growth and higher expenses. The trends for the quarter were robust loan growth, a low efficiency ratio even as we invested in compliance management and technology, and strong capital and liquidity positions. Further details are reflected on Slide 5. Net interest income was up $567 million year-over-year or 22%. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 11.06%, up 12 basis points from the prior year and down 28 basis points sequentially. The benefits from higher prime rates were offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional balances. Receivable growth was robust. Card increased 19% year-over-year, reflecting a lower payment rate versus the prior year and modest sales growth. The card payment rate remains stable quarter-over-quarter and about 200 basis points over 2019 levels. Sales volume grew 3% in the quarter. Through mid-July, growth continued to slow and was up about 1%. Turning to our non-card products. Personal loans were up 27% driven by strength in originations over the past year. We continue to experience strong consumer demand while staying disciplined in our underwriting. Deposit growth in the quarter was solid, with average consumer deposits up 20% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Our direct-to-consumer balances grew $2 billion and consumer deposits made up 66% of our total funding mix. We continue to target 70-plus-percent of funding from deposits. Looking at other revenue on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased $98 million or 16%. This was partially due to a $42 million loss on our equity investments in the prior year quarter compared to a $1 million gain this quarter. Adjusting for these, our non-interest income was up 9%, primarily driven by loan fee income. Moving to expenses on Slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $181 million or 15% year-over-year and up 2% from the prior quarter, primarily driven by our investments in our compliance management systems. These investments impacted several of our expense line items. Looking at our major expense categories, compensation costs were up $73 million or 14%, primarily due to increased headcount. Marketing expense increased $14 million or 6% as we prudently invested for growth, particularly in our deposits and personal loan products. Our commitment to disciplined cost management has not changed and we continue to target an efficiency ratio in the high 30s. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 3.22%, 142 basis points higher than the prior year and up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. Consistent with our expectation, we are seeing credit normalization across all of our lending products. Looking ahead in card, we continue to expect the seasoning of new accounts vintages and normalization of older vintages to result in higher losses through the back half of this year and into 2024. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 9. This quarter, we increased our reserve by $373 million, driven by our double-digit loan growth. Our reserve rate remained flat at 6.8%. Our outlook on the macro economy has improved modestly. We continue to monitor economic conditions and will make adjustments to our expectations as needed. Looking at slide 10, our capital position remains robust. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 11.7%, well ahead of regulatory requirements. The cumulative impact of the correction to the financial statements related to the card misclassification reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 20 basis points. In the quarter, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock and declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.70 per share. As Roger indicated, we are reviewing our compliance, risk management and corporate governance and are in discussions with our regulators on these topics. While this is ongoing, we have decided to pause share repurchases. Concluding on Slide 11 with our outlook. There has been no change to our loan growth expectations to be in the low to mid-teens. We are updating our NIM expectations to be around 11% for the full year, reflecting a combination of slightly lower asset yields driven by promotional mix and higher funding costs. We are raising our guidance for operating expenses to be up low double digits. As previously indicated, we are seeing upward pressure on expenses from the build-out of our compliance management systems. And we are lowering our expected range of net charge-offs to 3.4% to 3.6% based on our current delinquencies and roll rates. To wrap up, our business model continues to generate solid financial results and our capital, funding and liquidity positions remain strong. We continue to invest in actions that drive sustainable long-term performance, enable us to achieve excellence in all parts of our business. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Todd, to open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rick Shane : Thanks guys for taking my questions this morning. Look, I'd love to understand a little bit the link between what you identified in terms of the miscalculation and then how that precipitated the sort of inquiry into governance and consumer tracking? Roger Hochschild : Sure. So the FDIC matter is not linked to the misclassification. And so the misclassification is a separate issue. The FDIC matter is broadly around our compliance management system. It doesn't mean that the misclassification may not result in further regulatory action, but I don't want to speculate on that. Rick Shane : Got it. And is the expectation, when we've seen these in the past that they result in things like memorandum of understanding and can do things like either constrain growth limit, repurchases and capital actions, how do you see this playing out? And most importantly, I think what everybody really wants to know is what is a reasonable timeframe to get some further clarity here? Roger Hochschild : Yeah, it's -- I don't want to speculate on the timeframe of regulatory actions. I would say to your point though, they can take many forms. And so we're working through the draft with our regulators and we'll make more information available and the consent order will itself be public once that's completed. Rick Shane : Got it. Okay. I realized there's -- you have to be pretty circumspect about what you say here. So, thank you. Roger Hochschild : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Jeff Adelson : Yeah, hi, thanks. This is Jeff Adelson on for Betsy. Just appreciate all the sensitivity around this and understand you're pausing the buyback. I guess, this is -- this is some similar to what we saw last year in terms of regulatory issue and getting ahead of the buyback or freezing the buyback. Just wondering maybe if there's a way to speak to how these two issues kind of compare to the last year student loan servicing issue, maybe in terms of scoping complexity? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. I'll cover that piece and then maybe John can talk a bit about the buyback. So I would say the consent order in student loan servicing was a compliance matter. And so I think there's a link between that and the broader focus on our compliance management system. With that, maybe I'll let John talk a bit about the buyback. John Greene : Great. And -- thanks Roger. And as it relates to the buyback, we had robust conversations internally whether or not to pause the buyback. And what management recommended to the Board was that we pause the buyback as we work through the details of these compliance and risk management issues and are in conversations with our regulators. I want to reiterate the following though. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. So first invest in the business and growth and certainly through this year and into next year into compliance and risk management. And second, the priority will be to return excess capital to shareholders. So no change in terms of the two primary capital allocation priorities. I also want to focus your attention onto the strong capital generation that the business delivered in the quarter and has delivered historically. So we're hoping that we kind of work through these issues in an expedited fashion, but timing, I can't be specific on. So with that, the buyback will provide us much clarity on the timing of resumption when we have information on that. Jeff Adelson : Okay. Thank you. And just maybe shifting gears a bit here. Just wanted to see if we could get an update on what you're seeing in the consumer in your book today. Could you maybe also give us an update on the spend trajectory you've been seeing so far in July? I know you've talked about the growth rate slowing down to 3% in recent months. Wondering if we're seeing something similar from here? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. So it has slowed down further so far in July, so probably closer to 1%. Not necessarily as bad as it sounds in terms of the health of the consumer because you've got some very challenging comps compared to last year's growth as well as the very, very high level of new accounts we put on last year. And I think overall in terms of payment side, delinquencies and losses as John said are sort of normalizing right on the path we thought they were. And here I think that the strength of the job market is very constructive for our sort of prime consumer base. Jeff Adelson : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning guys. Roger Hochschild : Good morning. Ryan Nash : Roger, again, I know that we're probably limiting what we could say here on the compliance side, but I guess just a broader question. Can you maybe just help us understand, what are the areas that you feel that the company has underinvested in? And maybe just give us a framework for what you guys are doing in internally to fix these. I understand that John had talked about raising costs, but you -- can you give us a little bit more color in terms of what the investments you're making and what you think the timeline is to get these done? Roger Hochschild : Sure. John can maybe provide more color on the timeline. I would say it's a multi-year, but it's also something that we have been investing in over the last couple of years. So as you think about your compliance management system, it's everything from risk identification, sort of process mapping, building controls or change management processes, the resources you have around risk management in the first line, the resources you have in the second line in terms of the compliance function, testing, the internal audit, your governance processes. And so we are determined to be as strong on the compliance side and it's excellent there as we are around customer experience, data and analytic, every other aspect of our business model. So this is our top priority and the investment is both on the technology side, outside consultants, but also in terms of headcount here at Discover. John? John Greene : And then, Ryan, on the trajectory, and so I made this comment publicly about 1.5 months ago. 2019 to 2023, we increased our spend in compliance and I'll say some gentle items to ensure compliance works as we wish it to work. I indicated it was about an increase of $250 million as we relooked at it. We were going to accelerate that spend to probably $300 million increase from 2019 and a $200 million increase \u201822 to \u201923. Now the implications for that on \u201924, where we sit today, we expect once we achieve that level in \u201823 to be relatively consistent into \u201924. And then as we kind of shape this piece of our business into something that we desire, our regulators desire and our shareholders deserve, we expect that expense burn to reduce. Ryan Nash : Really appreciate all that color. And then maybe just on credit, I think Roger might have talked about the normalization of the front book as well as expectations for the back book to continue to normalize. But you took the credit loss range down a bit. So can you maybe just talk about one where you're seeing the improved performance in, John? As you look out, maybe just talk about your confidence in the curve on losses bending as we approach sort of the midpoint of next year? Thanks. John Greene : Yeah, great. So yeah, the tightening in the range was reflective of a couple of things. So first, as time moves on, we get more and more comfort with our forecasting on it. And to date, our forecasting has been right on top of actuals, our actuals have been right on top of the forecasting. So that gave us comfort. Second is, as time goes on, we can move from the analytical model to a more kind of traditional roll rate model that gives us a greater level of comfort around the charge-off and delinquency rates 30 day -- 30 days out to 180 days out. So that gave us comfort to tighten that range. And then on top of that, certainly the jobs -- jobs data and the forecast around employment gave us additional comfort. In terms of what we're seeing with the portfolio, exactly what I said in the prepared comments. So the newer vintages seasoning to expectation and older vintages basically normalizing to kind of 2019 levels. In terms of the shape of the curve, what we expect charge-offs to do in the back half of this year is the acceleration in terms of the rates of charge-off to begin to slow. And currently, we're expecting, kind of, charge-offs to peak in the second half of \u201824. It may push a little bit into \u201925, but right now we're seeing it in the second half of \u201824 and then reach the level, which likely will stabilize that for two to three quarters after. Ryan Nash : Great. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Morning, guys. And thanks for taking my questions. First one is that we talked about you giving us some sort of good trajectory of the normalization of the credit trends, which I guess occurs later this year, early into next year. I'm wondering given kind of the comps and stabilization of inflation and so forth, when do you expect to see normalization of loan growth and your guys opinions, what is the -- what is kind of the normalized level of loan growth? John Greene : Yeah. So certainly real robust loan growth in the first half of this year and the last quarter of 2022. We expect the rate of increase to slow certainly in the third and fourth quarter and also against really, really strong comps from 2022. And traditionally what this business has delivered is loan growth somewhere between 2 times and 4 times GDP growth. Now, we don't know what GDP is going to look like right now into \u201824, but I would say this. We did cut the edges on the lower credit quality, which is -- will impact new account growth in card for the balance of this year. We're seeing, as Roger indicated, and I mentioned in my comments, sales growth to slow and probably stabilize in the single digits. So that will also impact loan growth for the balance of this year and into next year. So the stabilized number is a multiple of GDP typically unless there's some change to the macros that indicates it's a good investment to either open up credit or appropriate to tighten credit. John Hecht : Yeah. That's a helpful framework to think about. And then with respect to the expense guide, I think you talked about some investment in compliance and some investment in technology and so forth. I'm wondering is there -- is there, maybe talk about the competitive climate at this point relative to the past few years. Is there any spending required from a competitive perspective or do you have any -- can you characterize the overall competitive environment as well? Roger Hochschild : I think we continue to see good results from the way we put to work on the marketing front in terms of our cost per account. Obviously, we've talked about the relaunch of cash back debit. We'll put some money against that, including the mass market campaign in the fall, but have been excited with what we're seeing in terms of the cost per funded account there. So while -- yeah the competitive environment is always intense across all of our businesses, we feel good about how our value proposition is competing out there across all of our consumer products. John Hecht : All right, guys. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : Hi. John, I was wondering if you could talk on the merchant miscalculation. Was that found internally or was that brought to you by a regulator or third party? John Greene : It was found internally. Don Fandetti : Okay, great. And then on NIM, it sounded like the trajectory was pretty good in general. And now it's going to be around 11%. Is there more promotional than you thought or more deposit competition, can you talk a bit about that? John Greene : Yeah. The -- it's a little bit of both actually. So we ended \u201822 at 11.04%. We said that we would be -- initial guidance up modestly. And then in the first quarter call, we said NIM has likely peaked and then it would begin to move downward and what I'll say normalize, likely to a higher level than it has been historically. So in the quarter, the reason that we tweak that guidance was we are -- we are investing in promotional balances. So attracting new customers or building balances with existing customers. Now, the returns on those offers are fantastic. The impact on NIM in the short term and the promotional period, it's minor. But given our activity there, it took a few points of net interest margin out. And we thought that was an important impact to communicate. Second, in terms of deposit competition, we had said that we thought that the beta would come in somewhere around 60% to 70%. What we've seen in late in the first quarter and into this quarter was our competitive set being more aggressive in terms of price increases. And as I've communicated in the past, we don't seek to be a price leader here. We try to compete on our brand, our customer offering, our digital assets that are first class in order to attract deposit customers. And we've been very successful as you can tell by the numbers there. But part of the proposition is also price. So what we're seeing now is betas likely to be north of 70% which is impacting net interest margin to the extent I just talked about in the guidance point. So those two factors are playing most substantially on the revised outlook. Don Fandetti : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. I have a follow-up on a couple of points made on the consent order. Maybe the first one, just on the share repurchase pause. Is that action taken in terms of prudence or out of an abundance of caution? Or do you think that there could be a material impact to your capital position? And I guess secondly, just on, John, you talked about the pressures on expenses into 2024. I guess, like, are there -- is there a leverage on other expense lines to sort of moderate the overall implications for the year? John Greene : Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. So the decision on the share repurchase was out of prudence. We have done a number of tests internally, stressing a number of factors, so that for example, the CCAR process we go through includes extreme stress. We dusted that off and ran some simulations. And the output of that was that both capital and liquidity, even in an extreme situation, remain well above regulatory requirements. So we feel comfortable about our capital and liquidity. The issue on the share repurchase was again out of prudence given what we have going on in the organization and we wanted to make sure that our actions are consistent with the right message in terms of being conservative and dealing with the first level of priority. In terms of\u2026 Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. John Greene : In terms of expense leverage, we continue to look at all of the lines and all of the investments we make in our expense base and the incident management situation we're dealing with in terms of resources to get that under control. That's a significant investment. Some resources supplement technology, people and consultants, certainly an investment. On the indirect side, we continue to leverage our procurement organization and ensure that, first, we concentrate on demand management and then, second, on making sure there's a fair value exchange. So that's the plan right now and will be the plan through the balance of this year. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. I guess follow-up just for Roger. I know you've gotten this question in the past and I'm just thinking about the higher teasers and such. I mean what makes you comfortable growing sort of mid-teens, high teens above the really strong lapping of very strong growth a year ago? I mean, I'm just thinking about just the complexion of the accounts you're bringing in that makes you very comfortable here because it's obviously having some implications on the NIM. Roger Hochschild : Yeah. Good question, Sanjay. You have seen that growth start to slow a bit. And I think it isn't necessarily that far out of line with what you're seen from our other, I'd say sophisticated prime focused competitors. It is really strong demand for the product. And as we've been clear, we have been tightening, not loosening credit, and are watching the accounts we book very carefully. And so we're always ready to make adjustments whether it's in the card product, the personal loan or elsewhere. But again, we feel good and are closely monitoring the performance. Within the credit, we're making adjustments continuously both on the portfolio side and the new account side. But these are very strong new accounts we're bringing in. And I think part of it is the differentiated value proposition that Discover offers continues to resonate well with our target customer. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Kevin Barker : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow-up on the expenses in particular. You said you continue to target efficiency ratio in the high 30s. Could there be a time where you may have to make additional investments, particularly around compliance that would have you go above the high 30s efficiency ratio for a short period of time before returning back to it, just given the near-term impacts of both additional marketing spend on debit account and the compliance issues? Thank you. John Greene : Sure. So as we sit here today, we feel comfortable with what we shared in terms of low double digit expense growth this year. We've taken a preliminary look at next year. We'll share -- we'll share that at appropriate time after -- after we kind of review and get our plan approved by our Board. But I'm feeling like it's very, very achievable. And that's why we -- we enunciated that target or that goal. But I would say this. As we see opportunities to grow profitably and not -- no contradiction to Roger's point earlier about the demand for our products, but we'll continue to take a look and invest for the medium term and longer term. And we're going to do that on the growth side. We're focused right now on the compliance side and we'll dial each of the expense levers in order to ensure we achieve results that our shareholders want, that our Board expects and that the management team expects. Kevin Barker : Are there any particular areas where you see the most opportunity to create efficiencies, whether it's marketing or headcount or anything out there that you see that can allow you to continue to hit your goals? John Greene : Yeah. So we're investing in advanced analytics that we're driving efficiencies in our rewards cost. We continue to look at third-party spend and have achieved great results in terms of year-over-year reduction in unit cost. The situation this year is that we've invested heavily in resources, people. So we're up -- we're about up about 3,000 people this year. So when you bring on additional people, both in collections and customer service as well as salary personnel, there's other costs that go along with it. So as we manage through this situation, I continue to believe there will be opportunities to drive efficiencies by combining like activities, taking a look at how resources are deployed to organizational structures and over time optimizing that. But right now, with the situation we're in, we've decided that the first priority is get the right resources in to focus on the issues we've talked about. And then we're going to be able to drive efficiencies in the future. Kevin Barker : Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Wanted to start maybe just on the business and the application quality of new applicants that you're seeing. I think you mentioned in response to John's question tightening underwriting. I guess, firstly, was that a new action you took in the second quarter? And then just related to that tightening of underwriting and application quality, I was wondering just if you -- I know you've talked in the past about monitoring -- actively monitoring the health of the consumer and the portfolio. Was there -- is there something you're seeing that is flashing red or caution that's making you tighter underwriting further here or just trying to understand who is the demand environment who is applying for a new loan currently, what's driving some of the underwriting changes? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. Good question. So the tightening was not in the second quarter and was not in response to something we're seeing. And actually in terms of applicant quality, whether it's for home equity, personal loans, student loan or in card, where we're seeing very stable characteristics in terms of average FICO, in terms of the custom scores we use. So it was a series of changes we made, I would say, in prior quarters. But a lot of stability in terms of the quality of applicant over the course of this quarter. Mihir Bhatia : Got it. And then maybe switching gears to the debit product that was relaunched. Can you talk just longer term strategically, what is the, I guess, the thinking behind that product, what is the goal, is the idea there, this is -- the opportunity to deepen relationships with customers and lower and how will that benefit you? Will it be through better NIM because if they're offering rewards, you can -- you don't necessarily need to offer as higher interest rates? Like, just talk a little bit more strategically about why the product makes sense to invest in for Discover and how you expect the growth trajectory of that product to go over the next few quarters here? Roger Hochschild : Yeah, great question. So, our aspiration is to be the leading digital bank. And so when you think about a digital bank, you think about the core DDA or debit product. And because we have a proprietary network, we can offer rewards in debit in a way no other large bank can. And it builds on our heritage around cashback and as the inventor of credit card rewards. So it's not just to cross-sell to our card customers. We think that this can pretty quickly become a significant entry point into the franchise for new customers. And then over time, much as we've done on the card side, if you can provide a superior value proposition and customer experience, they will want to buy other products from you whether that's a savings account and savings accounts where you also have the checking account and to have a lower beta or the card product. So again, a very important initiative for us, I think over time, will help continue transforming Discover. And we're excited for the potential and you'll see significant marketing against it this fall. Mihir Bhatia : Got it. And then just my last question. Just coming back to the compliance issue, look, I appreciate it's difficult provide too many details right now. But maybe just on the timing, give us some frame of reference, like, given that this is -- it sounds like the FDIC consent order also is related to compliance issues. You have the student loan issue. Now you have this issue. Does that entail a much longer review period or do you think this can go pretty quickly here like a quarter or two to go through? Again, I'm not saying when you resume buyback but at least like when you expect the review to be complete, what are you trying to -- how quickly are you trying to complete the review internally? And then I understand maybe the buyback discussion probably involves regulators and could be -- it's a little bit harder to cite. But at least the review maybe you can tell us, what your target is for like when you're trying to complete the review? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. And to frame the compliance issue, I would not over-focus on the regulatory portion. This is something where we as a team know we are not where we want to be and it is our top priority. So it is aligned with the views of the regulators, but our focus is taking many forms, from simplifying our architecture, automating manual processes, streamlining and standardizing business processes, bring on some great new talent as John talked about into the firm. And we know that the result will not just be better compliance but a better customer experience and more efficient organization. So the regulatory piece is important, but I would say what most -- is most important is the commitment from me, the team, the Board on achieving excellence in this area. That will be a multi-year initiative. But again, I think critically important to the future of the company and one that we as a team are very excited about. I would also separate that from the buyback. But again, it will be a journey on the compliance side, but one that we are 100% committed to. Mihir Bhatia : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Erika Najarian with UBS. Nick Holowko : Hi. This is Nick Holowko on for Erika. Thanks for taking my question. Just one more around the consent order and compliance issues. As you think about the operational complexity of the businesses you operate in and as you go through your view looking into these issues, do you feel like there may be an opportunity to take a closer look at some of the businesses you operate in, whether that might be student loans or anywhere else? Thank you. Roger Hochschild : Yeah. I'll talk maybe more broadly about operational complexity and then John can talk about the businesses. I think there's a great opportunity to simplify, whether it's -- we may have a similar process that is done differently. And again, we have a much more, I would say, homogeneous set of business is than just about any other bank or size. So we think there are significant opportunities to simplify, and again, those won't just help from a compliance standpoint over time once the investments are made, it will also help on the efficiency side. John Greene : Yeah. And then regarding our businesses and products, we think about this in line with our capital allocation priorities, our connections to our customer base and what we can manage and manage well. So we didn't start today. Historically, we've looked at all our products, our returns and as we look at those, we've made decisions to invest in order to drive growth or achieve compliance excellence. So we're going to continue to look at that. And if something's below our return targets, then we'll fix it and invest or we'll look at other alternatives. But certainly, the focus today is to take our existing products, make sure they're good offering that we can deliver those in a compliant way and drive a good return for our shareholders. Nick Holowko : Got it. Thank you for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Bob Napoli : Thank you, and good morning. And I -- just from a big picture perspective with the competitive environment, the compliance environment, Roger, as you look at your business, what is your confidence that Discover can deliver the types of returns that it has that investors have come used to over the last 10 to 20 years? Is there -- are you confident in delivering those returns with the higher compliance bar or the competitive set? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. I'd start by saying yes, right? This is an investment we need to make. It is the top priority for the company, but one that I think we will be able to do to fix. And again, over time, we'll see benefits not just in compliance, but in a better customer experience as well as more efficient. If you step way back, I've never been more excited about Discover's business model and how it compares. I think you're seeing the strength of our deposit franchise at a time when many banks are being tested, we have the scale and resources to compete with anyone. We're making the investments to be at the leading edge around data and analytics, are winning awards for our customer experience on not only just the card side, but also our deposit products. We have the re-launch of cash back debit. So in terms of the business model, and the returns we can give to our owners, in my 25 years at Discover, I've never been more excited. To get to all of that though, we need to get to where you need to be on the compliance standpoint. That's a critical part of operating a bank, a financial services organization. We are not where we need to be and we are going to get there. Bob Napoli : Thank you. And a follow-up, just on compliance, having followed Discover for a very long time, coming out of the great financial crisis, there was a lot big investment in compliance across the industry including -- at Discover. Has it become more difficult? I mean, I know there's been a number -- quite a few consent orders put out by regulators, but has it become -- maybe give us some color on what you're investing in compliance today. I don't know, if it's people or percentage of expenses versus historically, and how has it become a lot more difficult? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. It certainly is a challenging environment, but I'm not going to blame that, right? As I look back, I do believe we under invested and that's something I take accountability for, but we are very focused on it now. And as John, I think, highlighted, that investment takes many forms. Right? From bringing in some highly talented folks within the compliance area, building out our monitoring and controls, investments on the technology side to standardize, simplify, automate manual processes, as you think about it, compliance, a lot of the folks, it's risk management, right? And traditionally, we've been very strong around credit risk management, around liquidity risk management, but have not necessarily made the investments we needed, especially as the complexity of our business increased. As we got into more new products, I think there was a gap there in terms of our capabilities and that's what we're focused on now. Bob Napoli : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Arren Cyganovich : Thanks. On the net charge-off peak that you highlighted for -- into second half of \u201824 and possibly into \u201925, is that an expectation that it would go north of kind of your normal underwriting charge-off rate? John Greene : Thanks, Arren. No, I mean, we gave charge-off range. Now there's a numerator and denominator impact on that calculation, of course. But our underwriting is focused on prime revolver. Prime revolver behavior in our targeted segments looks very, very consistent to where it's been historically. And our return expectations remain high and we've been able to deliver on that. So in terms of is it going to be north and where it was historically, we have seasoning of those new vintages. But our credit box has been relatively consistent, our analytics to kind of target customers and understand kind of risk factors, I feel like has improved over the four years I've been here and certainly a longer journey than that. So the trajectory to me looks very, very comfortable in terms of continuing to be able to deliver high returns and generate capital. Arren Cyganovich : Okay. Thanks. And then just to clarify on the expense commentary, it sounds like you're not planning to pull back on marketing opportunities as your compliance costs are rising. And then if you could just clarify the numbers that you gave earlier, are those annual numbers? I think you said like $50 million up to $250 million and then $350 million and then down to $200 million. I'm just a little confused on the -- on the trajectories there. John Greene : Trajectory of the compliance management cost? Was that your question, Arren\u2026 Arren Cyganovich : Yeah. John Greene : \u2026or overall? Yeah. So I'll start with marketing and I'll focus on the client second. We haven't made a decision to pull back on marketing. We still see opportunity to generate positive returns from the customers that we're targeting in that prime revolver segment. And we're also putting money towards helping people understand our deposit products and hopefully find that we're compelling there. We also have the campaign on the cash back debit program slated for the second half of the year. So the marketing dollars, how we thought about them at the beginning of the year remains consistent with where we are today. And frankly, I think it would have been short-sighted to pull back in order to manage to a particular number given the high returns we're able to generate there. In terms of the compliance cost, what I was referencing was 2019 to where we are in 2023. And so about a month ago in a public forum, I said that that increase from \u201819 to \u201823 was about $250 million. As we've looked at the work in front of us, we are dedicating an incremental, call it, $20 million to $30 million, maybe as much as $50 million over and above that here. So it could be the delta from \u201819, not $250 million, but maybe as much as $300 million, year-over-year, so \u201922 to \u201923, we're up about $200 million in total compliance and related cost. Does that provide clarity? Arren Cyganovich : Yes. Yes, I got it. I got it now. Thank you. John Greene : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, great. Good morning, everybody. So When I look at your loan growth guidance, you talk about low to mid-teens. And to me, that means 14% basically. And so if you think about 14% or that range that you're discussing, it would indicate the second half loan growth would be roughly 7% and given the trajectory of loan growth in general, it would end spending being at 2.5% this quarter moving to 1% in the most recent month. It would suggest the fourth quarter's loan growth would be probably low single digits or something along those lines to make that guidance range. And so I was just curious if that's the right math that you are thinking about or roughly? If we could talk about that, that'd be great. John Greene : Yeah. I learned a long time ago not to give quarterly guidance because I found that I was not as accurate as I would have liked and other people would have liked. So the range of, kind of, the double digit growth that we talked about, you can take a look at the portfolio. We made some comments on what was driving it. So new accounts and certainly new account growth \u201822 to \u201823 has slowed. Sales, while still very robust at an absolute level, have slowed into July. We're doing targeted promotional activities to drive high generating, high returning accounts. And the comp in the fourth quarter of \u201822 versus prior quarters is certainly a tougher comp. So your math is certainly your math and I don't want to get into any more specifics than what I just did. Dominick Gabriele : No problem. Thanks a lot. And then, there are some signs that the national unemployment rate could start to move higher if you look at some of the state data. If you saw a seasoning and the unemployment rate rising at the same time, could it have a more additive effect for ultimately higher net charge-offs than otherwise to book without the seasoning effect? And maybe just to relate to that, your loan fee income has been quite robust in its growth and it beat our expectations by quite a lot this quarter. Is that kind of an indication of the seasoning effects that are going on with the late fees in that bucket? John Greene : Yeah. So -- Dominick Gabriele : Thanks so much. John Greene : Yeah. Arren, the answer to both questions is yes. So the loan fee income, typically late fees and NSF fees. And in terms of employment levels, if unemployment was to increase, that would certainly impact net charge offs. But I would say this. In the cohort of folks that we typically target, there -- what we've seen is if they are impacted by a job situation, their time of recovery is pretty quick. So by recovery, I mean, finding a new role. So the fact that this cohort of prime revolvers isn't in the upper tier of income levels allows them to have a greater opportunity to find jobs of equal pay -- equal or more pay in the current environment. So the employment -- early indications of employment or some challenges in some states, we don't see any sign of that translating into a credit situation for us. Dominick Gabriele : Okay, great. I'm going to sneak one more in here. Is there -- Discover spending growth is typically matched its loan growth trajectory over time given the stability of your business model. If we don't see a normalization of -- and meaningful fashion of payment rates, is there any reason that the spending growth and loan growth trajectories would be uncorrelated as they have been in the past? John Greene : Yeah. So we'll look at -- we'll look at kind of opportunities to drive loan growth. And part of that is the sales data or the spending data from consumers and reflect that in our next set of guidance that we provide. But specifically in correlation, in this form, I'm not going to get into. Dominick Gabriele : Okay. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bill Ryan with Seaport Research Partners. Bill Ryan : Hi, good morning and thanks for working me in here at the end. Question on the personal loans business. Last quarter, you talked about that there was some marginal tightening that you did, but you had fairly robust loan growth this quarter. Could you talk about the market opportunity that you're seeing there? And also the mix of new versus existing customers, I believe the historical mix was about 50-50, just curious if that's still the case? Roger Hochschild : Yeah. So in terms of overall competition, I'd say there's been a little bit of a pullback on the supply side from, I would say, markets and others as they pulled out. But there are a good number of competitors. A lot of them are much more broader spectrum than us in terms of how far down they go. I think what you're seeing is really strong consumer demand as rates have gone up and our product is primarily used for debt consolidation, people are looking to consolidate and pay down their credit cards. And so we're seeing very strong demand that is giving us ability to tighten credit and even at the margin, raise our prices and still see strong demand. So it's a product where underwriting and credit is everything. The mix is largely new, but a good amount are cross-sold to our existing cardholder base. So its customers where we also have experience with them. Bill Ryan : Okay. Thank you. Eric Wasserstrom : So I think we are going to conclude our call there. Thanks very much for joining us. If you have any follow-ups, please reach out to the IR team and we wish you a very good day. Thanks very much. Operator : This does conclude today's Second Quarter 2023 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2023 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you, Chelsea, and welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our third quarter earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our Interim CEO, John Owen, and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, you will be permitted to ask one question, followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to John. John Owen : Thank you, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. As I shared a few months ago, I have three priorities in my role as Interim CEO. First is, continue delivering a great customer experience at every touch point, which we do by providing our customers award-winning service and products. At the heart of this is, a team of more than 20,000 employees connected by common values and a shared mission to help people achieve a brighter financial future. Our second priority is to advance our culture of compliance. We have made significant strides in this area. By now, you've all had the opportunity to review the consent order issued by the FDIC in September. Consistent with the terms of this consent order, we have made meaningful investments in improving our corporate governance and enterprise risk management capabilities, and expect to drive further enhancements across the organization in the coming quarters. We have also started the process of engaging with our merchant partners on the card misclassification issue, remain in active dialog with our regulators on this topic. The resolution of this issue is likely to be complex and we anticipate it will take several quarters fully resolve. Our third priority is to sustain our strong financial performance. In the third quarter, revenue was up 17% year-over-year, driven by strong asset growth. Our credit losses continued to perform in-line with expected ranges. In addition, we were off to a strong start with the launch of our Cashback Debit product. We continue to believe that this product will be an important channel to welcome many new customers into our company. To highlight the Discover experience and support our brand and banking products, we're proud to have just introduced a new national advertising campaign featuring celebrity spokesperson, Jennifer Coolidge. As we continue to advance our priorities, we are focused on preserving and enhancing the elements to make Discover a great place to work. Last month, we're ranked among the 2023 Fortune Best Workplaces in Financial Services & Insurance. This accolade builds upon our recognition as one of Fortune 100's Best Companies to Work For. Before handing the call off to John Greene, I'll briefly comment on the CEO search. The Board is considering several excellent candidates both internal and external, remain confident that we will identify the next outstanding leader for this organization in the coming months. In summary, we continue to target excellence in all parts of our business, driving sustainable, long-term financial performance. I will now hand the call off to John to review our results in more detail. John Greene : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary results on Slide 4. In this quarter, we reported net income of $683 million, down from just over $1 billion in the prior-year quarter. Provision expense grew by $929 million, reflecting an increase in reserves and charge-offs. Strong loan growth, along with changing macroeconomic and household liquidity conditions drove the increase to our reserve balance. Charge-offs increased due to portfolio seasoning and remain in line with expectations. Revenue grew 17%, deposits grew 23%, and expenses increased 6% year-over-year. Further details are reflected on Slide 5. Net interest income was up $479 million year-over-year, or 17%. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 10.95%, down 10 basis points from the prior year and down 11 basis points sequentially. This decrease was driven by higher funding costs, which were partially offset by the benefits from higher prime rates. Receivable growth was robust. Card increased 16% year-over-year, reflecting new account growth and a lower payment rate versus the prior year. The payment rate declined about 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter, but remains just under 200 basis points above 2019 levels. Sales volume was relatively flat for the quarter. Personal loans were up 25%, driven by strength in originations over the past year and lower payment rates. We continue to experience strong consumer demand while staying disciplined in our underwriting. Student loans were up 1%. Deposit growth in the quarter was solid with average consumer deposits up 23% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Our direct-to-consumer balances grew $4 billion. Looking at other revenue on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased $97 million or 16%. This was primarily driven by higher transaction processing revenue from our PULSE business, an increase in loan fee income and strong net discount and interchange revenue. Moving to expenses on Slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $86 million or 6% year-over-year and up 4% from the prior quarter. This increase is driven primarily by investments in our compliance and risk management programs, and is reflected across several of our expense line items. Looking at our major expense categories, compensation costs were up $24 million, or 4%, primarily from increased headcount. The increase in information processing expense was driven by software licensing renewals, professional fees reflect an increase in third-party support as we focus on accelerating our compliance and risk management efforts. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 3.52%, 181 basis points higher than the prior year and up 30 basis points from the prior quarter. In card, we continue to see the effects of seasoning of newer accounts, which have higher delinquency rates than older vintages. Losses remained consistent with targeted ranges. These newer vintages support strong long-term profitability. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 9. This quarter, we increased our reserves by $601 million and our reserve rate increased by 22 basis points to just over 7%. The reserve increase reflects a modest deteriorating macroeconomic outlook, increasing delinquencies and higher loan balances. Our macro assumptions reflect a relatively strong labor market, but also consumer headwinds from declining savings rates and increasing debt burdens. Looking at Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 11.6%. The sequential decline of 10 basis points was driven largely by our strong organic asset growth. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock. Concluding on Slide 11 with our outlook. We now expect our loan growth to be in the mid-teens, as declining payment rates are offsetting the impact of slowing sales. There is no change to our NIM expectations to be approximately 11% for the full year. We're maintaining our expectations for operating expenses to be up low double digits. And there is no change to our expected range for net charge-offs to be between 3.4% and 3.6% for the year. In conclusion, our business fundamentals remain strong. We continue to generate solid financial results, while building out our compliance and risk management capabilities and prudently investing in actions that drive sustainable long-term performance. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to get a little bit more on the reserve build. As we look ahead, John Greene, can you just talk about like how we should think about that reserve rate increasing from here? Because, obviously, you made some adjustments, but you've said the credit numbers are performing pretty consistent with your expectations. So, is it a reflection on how you see things unfolding next year? Maybe you can just talk about the relation and how we should think about that reserve coverage on a go-forward basis, assuming the unemployment assumptions don't change much. John Greene : Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. Appreciate the question. So, let me back up and just give a little bit of an overview in terms of what happened in the quarter and why we increased the reserve rate. So, as we took a look at the portfolio performance and the loan growth, obviously, we had to make a reserve build for loan growth and that represented about 50% of the $600 million. The other 50% or approximately $300 million reflected our view on the macros. Now, while the unemployment numbers remain relatively in line and strong by historical standards, we are seeing some indications of stress. And if we go back to the pandemic and the learnings there, we found that certainly unemployment remains an important factor in terms of reserves, but there's other factors. And what we've done over the past year is try to build into those other factors into our loss models and reserve models, and we've done that. So, as we took a look at household net worth and savings rate, both have deteriorated. And we're seeing deterioration more specifically in lower FICO bands. So, we use those macro factors in order to capture loss content that we felt was appropriate from a reserving standpoint. So, as we look at reserve levels today and into the future, there's a couple of things that I'll say are just kind of general process items. First, it will be dependent on the macro views and whether they remain stable or deteriorating. Second, certainly, the portfolio performance will be a very, very important factor. And then, third will be the timing and trajectory of loss content. So, as losses become closer in terms of our projection period, their probability adjusted and, therefore, could increase reserve rate. Now, there's a lot of detail that I just provided. So, let me give a view of our expectations. So, first, the portfolio is performing generally well, although we are seeing mildly increased stress at the lower FICO bands to mid-FICO bands. We're also seeing that 2022 vintage performed slightly worse than '21, '23 although highly profitable. So, as we look forward to '24, we'll run our process and adjust the reserve as we deem most appropriate. An important piece will also be the charge-off trajectory. So, what we've said previously is we expect charge-offs to peak sometime around the midpoint of the year to the second half of the year, if -- second half of 2024. So, if we don't see a slowing in delinquency rates between now and first quarter, certainly that could be an indication that we'll have to take incremental provisions. So, a lot there. Hopefully enough for you to be able to digest and move forward with. Sanjay Sakhrani : Yeah. Thank you. That's clear. And just under the banner of sort of regulatory stuff, question number one, it doesn't seem like there is a whole lot to update in terms of other actions. We obviously got the consent order. And then, I saw in the perspective for 2023, you still have a pause for the capital management fees not any change to that. So, could you just give us a sense of sort of how to think about that unpausing of the share repurchase? I know John Owen mentioned it might take several quarters to resolve the merchant issue. So, just trying to reconcile these -- those comments. Thanks. John Greene : Sure. Yeah, I'll take that one too, Sanjay. So, let me first start out by saying our capital allocation priorities aren't changed. So, invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders. That's very clear from our business model, our management team and our Board. The second piece to the answer relates to our continued work on the card tiering issue and other governance issues. So, we're making reasonably good progress on both of those. And what we'll do as part of our 2024 planning process is we'll make a recommendation to the Board regarding our capital actions and, specifically, the buyback. And then, we'll provide an update on our January call associated with our fourth quarter earnings. John Owen : Let me just add a little bit to John's answer on kind of where we are from a regulatory standpoint. The FDIC consent order that was made public this month related really to findings from end of 2021 looking back. As we said before, we've made significant investments in our risk management compliance capabilities over the last 18 months. From a spending standpoint, we've increased our spending from $225 million in 2022 to about $460 million in 2023. But I would tell you, as we've made good progress resolving many of our issues, but we still have a significant amount of work to do before we're satisfied with where we are. On the card misclassification issue, it's not part of that FDIC consent order, that's a separate matter. And where we are on that? As we've mentioned before, we did have an outside law firm complete an investigation on the card misclassification issue. That work is substantially complete at this point in time. We've shared that result of that with our Board of Directors and also with our regulators. At this point in time, we're awaiting feedback from regulators. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the reserve rate comments. John Greene, you've referenced several macro variables impacting the reserve and you also cited higher delinquencies, which are more idiosyncratic. Some investors are concerned that rising DQs may be a function of more than just seasoning. Maybe could you just help us with what your response would be to the concern that some investors have expressed that outsized reserve build is a sign that Discover may have reached for growth too aggressively during the pandemic and is now facing the consequences, perhaps what could ultimately end-up being greater credit degradation in 2024 and possibly beyond, particularly since we're still in an environment where the unemployment rate is 3.5%? John Greene : Yeah. Thanks, Bill. So, let me go back a little bit and be real clear about what happened in the second half of '21 and '22 in terms of originations. So, second half of '21, we resumed and we went back to our traditional credit box. In the early part of '22, we continued with that traditional Discover credit box. We did do a test in marginal prime and near prime which we turned on. We saw the results and we turned off in the second quarter or early third quarter of '22. So, about six months of originations, not dramatic volume by any means, but certainly a test, it's a good opportunity to learn to see if we could capture some unprofitable share. What we found was, those accounts weren't meeting our return of volatility threshold. So, they were shut down. The rest of the '22 vintage was within the traditional credit box that Discover had. And '23 remains there, although we're peeling back. I will say this, the '22 vintage was certainly outsized as a result of demand and great execution from our marketing team. The profitability of that still remains very, very strong in the short-term, medium-term and long-term. So, if we're going to do it all over again, at this point, we'd certainly answer definitively, yes, we would continue to originate the loans that we put on the books. But that vintage is significantly larger than other vintages. So, the natural loss content of new originations is somewhere between 12 and 24 months, and we expect that to play out, and as I've said, the delinquencies and charge-offs to peak sometime in 2024. So, I hope that is helpful in terms of giving it a little bit of color in terms of the process we went through, our risk tolerance, and what we expect to see from those vintages. Bill Carcache : Yes, that's helpful. Thanks, John. And appreciate that. If I could ask a follow-up of John Owen, could you speak to the possibility of potentially, I guess, your overall interest level in potentially pursuing strategic alternatives for any of the other businesses, whether that be student lending or anything else? Or is that more likely to wait -- are you more likely to hold off until the new CEO kind of comes on board, which you mentioned, is probably in the next several months? John Owen : Yeah. Happy to talk about that. As you know, we really can't speculate or talk about rumors or selling parts of the business. What I can tell you is part of our strategic planning process that we do every year is to evaluate all of our businesses for returns and fit from a strategic standpoint. We do that as an annual process. We are going through that process as we speak. But again, that's something we do as part of our annual planning process. Bill Carcache : Thank you for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Ryan Nash : Hey, good morning, guys. John Greene : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Nash : So, John, you reiterated the expense guidance for '23, which is obviously a positive, and I'm sure you're going through the budgeting process right now. But I guess based on what you know today regarding the consent order, the work that John Owen that you referenced that you're doing, you've made substantial progress plus overall inflation, any sense for what expense growth is going to look like into 2024? Maybe just talk about some of the moving pieces that you expect to drive the expense base next year? John Greene : Sure. I'm not going to be real specific on '24. We're still in the process of building out the budget and we're yet to share our recommendation with the Board. But I can give you a general kind of direction of what we're seeing. So, the first point I think is important to point out there is that, we continue to target our efficiency ratio to be below 40%. Now, that's over the medium-term. Obviously, our execution this year with the revenue growth and even with substantial investments in compliance and in other areas of the business shows an efficiency ratio significantly below 40%. But over the mid-term, that's something I think investors can expect. The second piece that's important is that despite a significant amount of investment in risk and compliance resources, we will continue to be disciplined in our allocation of expense dollars. And we're focused on making sure that the expense dollars that we do spend either help us with our compliance and risk management programs overall or generate positive earnings potential for the firm. So, they're the focal point. In terms of some of the things where we continue to look at, we're looking at our facilities footprint. We expect to be able to continue to make some progress on that. Our third-party spend, we're scrutinizing significantly with the help of our procurement and vendor management teams. And we're going to continue to look at resource levels to make sure they're appropriate for the environment and what we're trying to execute on. So, I hope that provides some context, Ryan, on how we're thinking about the expense base in the aggregate. And that will translate into what we hope is a reasonably good set of expense and efficiency numbers into the future. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thanks for the color. And maybe the follow-up on some of Sanjay and Bill's question. So, when I think about the comments that you and John made regarding the trajectory of the '22 vintage, '23 likely hasn't begun to [season] (ph) yet inflation weighing on consumers. Can you maybe just help us understand more broadly just thinking about how we should see the trajectory of delinquencies, meaning could we actually see the underperformance that we've experienced get worse as we sort of go through this next period of time given that you do have this really big vintage that's coming through? And any commentary on framing how much of this is seasoning -- and how much of the delinquency performance is seasoning of the book versus actual underlying deterioration that you're seeing in the core customer base? John Greene : Yeah. A lot to parse there, Ryan. Let me start by kind of walking you through what we're seeing in the portfolio. So, we are seeing kind of differences in performance on customers that historically have been transactor versus revolver. So, our revolver base, we're seeing a more significant decrease in sales activity, which makes sense, right, as they try to manage their household budget. We're seeing accounts that transacted in '21, '20 and '22 beginning to revolve more. So, the revolve rate is back to where we were historically. And the '23 vintages, early indications are that it's performing very, very well. 2022 is performing well, but not as well as 2023. So, my expectation is that delinquencies will slow in the first half of 2024. If that doesn't happen, that's an indication that the stress that the consumers are seeing is more significant than what we're observing today. Ryan Nash : Thanks for the color, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is open. John Hecht : Hey, guys. Thanks very much. Actually, most of my questions and the fact just even the last question was exactly overlapping. So, maybe I'll just quickly ask, number one is, maybe a quick update on kind of the competitive environment, what kind of zero balance kind of transfer activity you're engaging in and other kind of factors that you would tie to competition as kind of the credit environment maybe migrates a little bit? And then, what are you guys -- on that front, what are you doing with respect to underwriting to account for some of these changes that you're seeing as well? John Greene : Great. Yeah. I'll take that. So, the environment continues to be competitive from a card origination standpoint. We are seeing less competition in kind of the lower FICO band. So, remember, we're a prime revolver, so we're focused on prime customers, and the lower tier of origination envelope is, frankly, less competitive. So, we're careful as we're looking at that to make sure that those folks seeking credit are worthy of credit and not going to turn into a subsequent charge-off. The upper prime remains very, very competitive. The rewards competition, you can see it by the television ads, has certainly subsided significantly. So, the market is always competitive. The competition varies among various FICO bands. And we're going to continue to compete and generate positive new accounts, but we're also mindful of the credit situation. John Hecht : Great. Thank you, guys, very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Jeff Adelson : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. John Greene, just wanted to follow up on the commentary of peak losses. I think you mentioned sometimes in -- sometime in mid to late 2024. I think, last quarter, you talked about maybe this getting pushed into 2025. Is there a risk that maybe the peak kind of plateaus at or around those higher levels? Or do you think, as your 2020 vintage kind of peaks out and starts moderating in size, the losses in delinquency should just naturally drift lower? John Greene : Yeah. I think it will peak, and then, upon its peak, I think it will stabilize up there for a few quarters, maybe two to three quarters, and then we expect it to come down. That's all subject to kind of the macro environment, obviously. But in terms of what we're seeing today, that's the expectation. Jeff Adelson : And then, just on the sales volumes, I know they were pretty flattish this quarter. Just wondering, under the hood, what's going on there. Is this representative of maybe more of a slower growth in new accounts? Is maybe your same-store customer still growing at a faster pace year-over-year? And then just maybe thinking through the dynamic of faster network volumes, faster debit volumes, anything going on there that's driving your debit and network volumes to reaccelerate versus your proprietary card volumes to slow? John Greene : Yeah. So, let me start with sales. So, what we're seeing is a downward trend in sales. So, if you go back to the fourth quarter of '23, we're at about 10% year-over-year growth. First quarter was 8%, 2.5% in the second quarter, and about 1% here in the third quarter and through mid-October, about 1%. Interestingly enough, the dynamics are changing in terms of categories. So, online spend is up around 4% to 5%, every day spend is up about 3%. That's largely inflation driven, we believe. And discretionary is flat to down with the exception of entertainment expense or entertainment-related categories, which is up north of 20%, which is hard for me to understand at this point. But we're trying to dig into the details. In terms of implications for next year, we're going to assume a relatively modest sales growth, maybe slow in the lower single digits. The transactor revolver components of that, I mentioned that already. So, more pullback on the revolver base. The other piece of your question is debit transactions. We've had great execution from our PULSE business. So, we've expanded a number of contractual arrangements and also debit choice routing has actually made a difference in the volumes. So, our PULSE team is executing well and appears to be capturing some share. Jeff Adelson : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. John Greene : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Rick Shane : Thanks, guys, for taking my questions this morning. Hey, look, you've cited a couple of things that are driving the increase in delinquencies. You've talked about seizing them vintage. You've talked about some exposure to lower FICO scores within the cohorts. At the same time, you guys are starting to apply a lot more machine learning to your portfolio and your process. I'm curious if you are identifying other factors that are contributing to the increase in delinquencies, whether it's age demographic, geography, what might be other factors that are contributing to this in the context of strong labor markets. And then the follow-up to that is, with that information, can you then apply different servicing strategies to enhance that performance? John Greene : Yeah, you're into the secret sauce of underwriting, Rick. But I'll give you a little bit of overview. So, we spent a lot of time trying to revive -- to update our models. And we looked at, no exaggeration, probably 300 different risk identifiers or risk [leaders] (ph). And what we did find is savings rate is important, household net worth is important, the amount of credit on us, so on the credit report and Discover's balance sheet as well as the amount of credit off are -- continue to be really, really important. And then also, there's some work being done on cash flow underwriting because of some of the off bureau credit that we experienced or the whole market experienced in '21 and '22. So, we're going to continue to look to refine our models and see what we can do to identify accounts that are going to be highly profitable and originate those. In terms of the second part of your question around servicing strategies, there's been a lot of work done on best time to contact, and we've got some machine learning models that are focused on that, as well as best channel to contact, so is it via phone, e-mail, text or other means. All that work is ongoing. And frankly, it will never stop. It will be a continued refinement of the model so that we can collect effectively and originate profitably. Rick Shane : Got it. Hey, John, it's very interesting, and very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Mihir Bhatia : Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. To start, I wanted to actually ask about personal loans. You're continuing to see some very healthy growth there. Can you talk a little bit more about some of the drivers? I think I know you mentioned a little bit of payment rate pullback, but what about from a competition standpoint? What's driving that? And then, just related to that -- the comments you've been making about on the credit card side, I wanted to understand if you're seeing any meaningful deterioration in credit there? Anything on the -- do the vintage comments apply here? Anything like we should be thinking about there? Are you tightening underwriting currently in that personal loan space too? Yeah, thanks. John Greene : Yeah. Thanks, Mihir. So, our average ticket on a personal loan is significantly larger than many of our competitors. And the predominant share of the volume now is for debt consolidation efforts. And important to recognize that as part of our underwriting process, when there's a debt consolidation customer, somewhere between 70% to 80% of the disbursement goes to the creditors to ensure that the overall cost of debt for that customer is lowered and, therefore, their ability to pay is high. So that's an important distinction. In terms of growth, what we've seen is, high level of demand, but also a reduction in the payment rate. And that reduction in the payment rate is also been responsible for a very significant chunk of the growth that we've seen in the quarter. In terms of kind of the performance there, it is, what I'll say, returning to more historical performance metrics. But, again, highly profitable, and you can see from the report or from the details in terms of delinquency rates, they've remained very, very low relative to historical standards. Mihir Bhatia : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Maybe if I could just turn back a little for a second to the compliance issue question and the timing, et cetera. It sounds like from what you're saying related to the merchant mispricing issue, the outside law firm has completed the investigation. You've discussed results with regulators already. So, I think a lot of what a lot of people are just trying to understand is what needs to happen for the buybacks to resume. I understand it's difficult to put a specific date out there. But is the overall message, it's going to take several quarters for those to review? Maybe just help us understand what needs to happen here for you to get comfortable. And, again, like, I understand you don't want to put a specific timeframe, but is the right message, like, it's going to be several quarters more? Thanks. John Greene : Yeah. So, no specific timing on the resumption. So, what we want to do is have further dialogue with our merchants to ensure we're progressing the remediation and the negotiation. We also continue to have discussions with our regulatory agencies and we're looking to progress those. And we're also reviewing our capital positions, right? There's a number of pulls on capital this year. Certainly, the phenomenal loan growth that we've seen, we've got the Basel Endgame that's on the horizon. We have the CECL phase-in also impacting capital levels. So, we're going to take a look at the profitability for 2024. Take a look at the progress we're making on the card tiering issue and overall risk and governance items, and make a recommendation to the Board. So my -- I'll say my key summary here is that our capital priorities haven't changed. We're focused on generating positive earnings to be able to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders. Our margin rates remain robust. Our return on equity this quarter and for the year remains really, really strong. So, it's a matter of just making sure we've got the right balance between investing and return of capital. Mihir Bhatia : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is open. Bob Napoli : Thank you. Follow-up on return on equity. One of the questions we get, I mean, obviously, Discover has reported very strong ROE for a very long time, with the changes in regulations and potential capital changes. What are your thoughts on Discover being able to generate the types of return on equity that we've seen over the last 15 years or so? John Greene : Yeah. Certainly, relative to kind of history and then going forward, a couple of important points. So, we have operated with capital well above our operating target for the better part of, I don't know, at least as long as I've been here, four years now. And we are approaching the 10.5% target. I will say that our overall capital position does remain very, very strong, right? So, regulatory minimum is 4.5%, the SCB, 2.5%. So, the required capital, 7%, and we're at 11.6% here on CET1 for the quarter. So, my expectation is we're going to manage the business to continue to generate high returns and deliver a high level of return on equity overall and be able to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders. So, as we go out three to five years, it's a bit challenging to predict a regulatory regime and the expectations for institutions such as ours in terms of overall capital levels. But we're well positioned to generate positive capital and return capital. Bob Napoli : Thank you. I appreciate that. And then, just on -- the overall -- the long-term growth of your business, your core customer, the TAM of your business and the ability for Discover to grow, I mean, I think historically, high-single digit kind of loan growth and spending growth. What are your thoughts? Is the ability to grow at those types of rates what we should continue to expect? And how does the Cashback Debit product maybe affect that growth? John Greene : Yeah. I mean, certainly, our expectation is to continue to grow, at least in line with kind of the historical norms. The Cashback Debit product, we actually think has a lot of power behind it. So, the features of the product itself are super, right? So, 1% cash back on debit transactions. We have a positive kind of business impact from our ability to capture interchange on those transactions, so that's positive. And then, it's a whole new customer outlet for us. So, executed well, it'll bring in a new cohort of customers that we can then underwrite and cross-sell to and further help the customer experience in terms of meeting additional banking needs and turn that checking product into a credit card relationship or perhaps a personal loan down the road. So, we're super excited about it. Bob Napoli : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Kevin Barker : I just wanted to follow up on some of the spending on tech in particular in the info processing line. Could you provide a little more detail on some of the projects that you have in place? And whether you expect those to be ongoing or are there additional projects that you anticipate, particularly around tech investment and other investments that you're making within the franchise? Thank you. John Greene : Yeah. So, we're a digital institution. So, the first piece is we're going to continue to invest in tech and advanced analytics to kind of help the customer experience and then also help us to generate positive returns. Some of the specific projects that we're working on, so we've got a number of advanced analytics programs around collections and around originations in order to be able to service the customers well and then target the right sort of customers. We also did a bunch of work last year and into this year in terms of improving the closure rate of leads from a lead into a funded customer, whether it was a savings or credit customer. This year, we're investing heavily in our risk and compliance systems, so certainly there's tech spend going on there. We also have tech spend related to our on-prem servers and moving to a hybrid and cloud environment, that's certainly a significant spend. And then also, given the risk and compliance issues that we've seen historically, we're spending a lot of time taking a look at how our core systems work, the data that goes in and the data that comes out and what we do with the data, and looking to kind of reduce the amount of manual touches to that data. So, all of that is part of the reason or the reasons why we're seeing kind of information processing and tech spend overall increase this year. John Owen : Two other areas I would call out. Around our fraud detection, we continue to invest heavily in our fraud detection. That's an ongoing battle every quarter, but we've made significant investments in fraud and continue to push on that area. The second thing, around our digital capabilities as a digital bank. We've got a very easy to use system, easy application process, very easy for customers to open up their Cashback Debit. And so, we spend a lot of time and effort in customer flows and customer engagement and how we onboard customers in a more seamless manner. Kevin Barker : Thank you for all that detail. And just to follow-up on your investment on enhancing recovery rates, have you seen any particular shift in the recovery rates you have today or where they're trending relative to past cycles? John Greene : No specific changes to recovery rates. We are seeing more customers seek credit assistance and negotiate settlements. There seems to be a cottage industry developing around that. And that's back in this -- I think it was the month of July, we saw a chunk of charge-offs come through as a result of settlements from these institutions. But overall recovery rates remain strong. The pool of charge-offs to be able to capture recoveries from, obviously, is increasing as the charge-offs increase. So that's actually part of our -- how we take a look at overall credit and reserving. Kevin Barker : Thank you, John. John Greene : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open. Nick Holowko : Hi, good morning. This is Nick Holowko on for Erika. Thanks for taking our questions. Most of them have been answered, but just wanted to follow up with one question on loan growth. So, obviously, card growth remains really robust and you raised your guidance to mid-teens for the year. And I'm just wondering, given the comments on the stress in the lower and mid FICO scores, and then the delinquency trends, and then your comments that the revolve rate has really normalized, I'm wondering if you can help us with which parts of the FICO band in your portfolio are driving the loan growth, and whether you're seeing any outsized contribution from those on the lower end? John Greene : Yeah. What we're seeing is kind of loan build driven by two factors. So, it's somewhere between 30% and 40% of the build is -- or the loan growth is from new accounts, and then the remainder is coming from payment rate normalization. So, we're seeing kind of portfolio customers increasing their balances. So -- and that normalization of payment rate is pretty consistent on the upper bands to the -- call it, to the midpoint to the top two-thirds of the portfolio. The bottom third, the payment rate normalized last year, and we're seeing that at pretty close to historical levels, maybe a mild deterioration from that. Nick Holowko : Got it. Thank you for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Dominick Gabriele : Hey, thanks so much. Something sort of related to that, so we just think about the year-over-year spending growth, roughly 1%, I guess, what was the year-over-year growth in the number of cards or new accounts? And also, what was the -- and just added to that, what is the benefit that Discover saw to spending in the quarter related to gas on the growth? And then, I just have a follow-up. Thanks. John Greene : Yeah. So, we grew, and I -- we made public comments on this. In 2022, we grew accounts about 20% overall. This year, as we've taken a look at the kind of credit performance, we're on pace to kind of originate about the same number of overall accounts. So, the growth in terms of new accounts will be relatively flat, but the new account generation will be pretty consistent year-over-year. That could change if we [pare] (ph) back credit here in the fourth quarter and into next year. In terms of gas, that was interesting. So, gas was up 1% in the quarter. It was also 5% category. So, when you adjust for kind of the deflationary impact, the usage there was -- or at least through our card was up over 10%. Dominick Gabriele : Okay, great. And then, obviously, you have a lot of student loans. You're one of the major players. We have the moratorium ending. I know that that doesn't affect you directly perhaps in your own loans, because they're private loans, but what are you seeing in the data that you're watching of how this might be affecting either payment rates or demand for private loans or refinancings? Anything you can provide as far as how this affects the consumer that you're seeing in your data, only in 19 days or whatever, but anything you can provide would be really helpful. Thank you. John Greene : Yeah. So, we're not seeing anything in our data yet whatsoever. We did actually, a couple quarters ago, quantify what we thought the impact could be to our portfolio in terms of charge-offs. And as it turns out, based on the executive order direction in terms of kind of the repayment structure that the Biden administration is putting in place and making kind of payments levels associated or tied to income levels, we expect the impact on our portfolio to be de minimis. Now, we'll see how it all plays out legislatively, but we're not expecting a significant impact certainly this year, and we'll evaluate to see what happens and take a look at our data to make a determination if it is going to have an adverse impact on our charge-offs. But today, nothing. Dominick Gabriele : Got it. Thank you. John Greene : You're welcome, Dominick. Operator : This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. And I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Eric Wasserstrom for any additional or closing remarks. Eric Wasserstrom : Well, thank you very much for joining us this morning. If you have any additional questions, please reach out to the IR team and looking forward to hear from you. Thanks very much. Take care. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's program, and we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter 2023 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you, and welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin on Slide 2 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our fourth quarter 2023 earnings press release and presentation. Our call today will include remarks from our Interim CEO, John Owen; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there will be time for a question-and-answer session. During the Q&A session, we request that you ask one question, followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up question, please return to the queue. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to John. John Owen : Thank you, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. 2023 was a year of significant change for Discover, and we believe the actions we've taken position the company to continue driving strong long-term performance. When I stepped into the Interim CEO role, I had three priorities. My top priority was to advance our culture of compliance. We have made meaningful strides in our corporate governance and risk management capabilities. That said, this is a journey that will take time and continued investments over the coming years to further enhance our compliance and risk management capabilities. My second priority is to continue delivering a great customer experience at every touch point, which we do by providing our customers with award-winning service and products. I'd like to thank our 20,000 employees for delivering a great customer experience to help our customers achieve a brighter financial future. In 2023, we were recognized for the first time as one of Fortune 100 best companies to work for. This award adds to accolade for working parents, women, people with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ+ community, and we're proud to be an inclusive workplace. My third priority is to sustain our strong financial performance. We reported net income of $2.9 billion for full year 2023 and earnings per share of $11.26. This makes 2023 the third best year for EPS performance in our history. In delivering these results, we achieved several important milestones. We exceeded $100 billion in card receivables, grew deposits by 21% year-over-year, successfully launched our cashback debit account on a national scale, and we announced our intent to exit the private student lending business. On December 11, we announced a new leadership and we're excited to have Michael Rhodes joining us for our incoming Chief Executive Officer. Michael is an experienced leader with a deep background in the financial services industry. He has managed all aspects of our Consumer Banking business with deep experience in the credit card space, payments, online and mobile banking and served as Group Head of Innovation and Technology. His appointment marks the conclusion of a rigorous search process, and we look forward to Michael's arrival. When Michael arrives, I will return to my prior role on Discover\u2019s Board of Directors. In conclusion, I'm proud of the progress we made in 2023. Our integrated digital banking model, resilient financial performance and maturing risk management and compliance capabilities position Discover well for 2024 and beyond. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John Greene, who will review our fourth quarter 2023 financial results in more detail and provide some perspective on 2024. John Greene : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our summary financial results on Slide 4. In the quarter, we reported net income of $388 million, down from just over $1 billion in the prior year quarter. There are three broad trends to call out. First, we grew revenue 13%, reflecting 15% loan growth, partially offset by modest NIM compression. Second, provision expense grew by $1 billion. Charge-offs increased, but landed at the low-end of our expected range. Strong loan growth and higher delinquency drove the increase to our reserve balance. Finally, expenses increased 19% year-over-year, reflecting investments in compliance and risk management, a reserve for customer remediation and higher marketing expense to support our national Cashback Debit campaign. We'll get into the details of these topics on the following pages. Turning to Slide 5. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 10.98%, down 29 basis points from the prior year and up 3 basis points sequentially. The decline from the prior year quarter was driven by higher funding costs and higher interest charge-offs, which were partially offset by higher prime rates and increases in revolving balances. For the full year, net interest margin was 11.07%, up 3 basis points from the prior year. This margin performance reflects the improvement in our funding mix over the past several years and a reduced level of balance transfer and promotional balances as we tightened underwriting. Receivable growth remained robust. Card increased 13% year-over-year due to contributions from the prior year new account growth and a lower payment rate. The payment rate declined about 110 basis points from the sequential quarter and is now 100 basis points above 2019 levels. Overall, new account growth declined 9% as a result of credit actions. Sales were up 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Personal loans were up 23%, driven by continued strength in originations and lower payment rate versus the prior year. Student loans were flat year-over-year as we prepare for a potential sale of this portfolio we will cease accepting applications for new loans on February 1. Our Deposit business delivered outstanding performance in a challenging year. Average deposits were up 21% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Our direct-to-consumer balances grew $3 billion in the period and $14 billion in the year. Looking at other revenue on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased $74 million or 11%. This was primarily driven by an increase in loan fee income, higher transaction processing revenue from our PULSE business and higher net discount and interchange revenue. Our rewards rate was 137 basis points in the period and 140 basis points for the full year 2023, a decrease of 1 basis point on a full year basis. The decline reflects lower cashback match from slowing new account growth and our active management of our 5% categories. Moving to expenses on Slide 7. Total operating expenses were up $280 million, or 19% year-over-year, and up 22% from the prior quarter. Looking at our major expense categories, compensation cost increased $73 million or 13% from higher headcount. Marketing expenses increased $59 million or 19%. Professional fees were up driven by continued investment in compliance and risk management capabilities, while other expense reflects a reserve for customer remediation. Moving to credit performance on Slide 8. Total net charge-offs were 4.11%, 198 basis points higher than the prior year and up 59 basis points from the prior quarter. In card, as anticipated, delinquency formation is slowing as more recent vintages season. We added a slide detailing some of the drivers of our credit performance in the appendix to the earnings presentation. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 9. This quarter, we increased our reserves by $618 million, and our reserve rate increased by 17 basis points to just over 7.2%. The increase in reserves was driven by receivable growth and higher near-term loss content from higher delinquencies. Under CECL, reserve levels increase as you approach peak losses. We expect our losses to rise through the midyear and then plateau through the back half with some seasonal variation. In terms of our macroeconomic outlook, our view of unemployment was relatively unchanged, while household net worth projections increased slightly. These changes provided a small benefit to reserves. Looking at Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 11.3%. The sequential decline of 30 basis points was driven largely by asset growth. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock. Concluding on Slide 11 with our perspective on 2024. These exclude the impact of a potential student loan portfolio sale. We expect end-of-period loan growth to be relatively flat, while average loan growth will be up modestly year-over-year. We expect full year net interest margin to be 10.5% to 10.8%. We're currently anticipating core rate cuts of 25 basis points in 2024. This is two more rate cuts than in our forecast in December. Each cut reduces NIM by approximately 5 basis points subject to a deposit beta. We expect total operating expenses to increase by a mid-single-digit percent. This contemplates our expectation for compliance-related costs to be approximately $500 million this year. Total expenses may increase as incremental resources or remediation is required. We expect net charge-offs in the range of 4.9% to 5.3%. Finally, regarding capital return. We will participate in this year CCAR's process, and believe the results should help inform our view of capital management for 2024. Importantly, our capital management priorities have not changed and remain centered on supporting organic growth and returning capital to shareholders. To summarize, we continue to generate solid financial results. For 2024, we will continue to advance our compliance and risk management capabilities and invest in actions that drive sustainable, long-term value creation. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rick Shane : Good morning everybody and thanks for taking my questions. I'm not a little under the weather today, so I apologize. The loan growth expectations, is that organic loan growth or is that net of the portfolio sale of the student loans? John Greene : Hi, Rick, John Greene here. That is organic loan growth. So all of the guidance excluded the impact of a potential student loan asset sale. Rick Shane : Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. John, maybe just a follow-up on Rick's question. I mean given the strong growth that you're currently seeing in the Personal Loan business, and the fact that you're still adding accounts, albeit at a lower level in the Credit Card business, you did mention kind of lower balance transfers, but is there something else going on? Can you talk about kind of deconstruct that loan growth expectation for us a little bit? John Greene : Sure, sure. Thanks, Moshe. So the bonus of loan growth sales, new account generation, payment rate trends. And so what we\u2019re anticipating for sales given the slowdown through 2023 in terms of sales, although we did have a pretty strong holiday season, sales will be relatively flat year-over-year. New account generation relative to last year, certainly down, but overall positive new account growth. And payment rate, what we've tried to do here is kind of derisk the forecast. So we assume that 100 basis points of payment rate that's elevated versus 2019 will remain elevated. So those three components reflect end up coming in and reflecting on our projections. Now loan growth could actually come in higher if payment rate continues to decline. But overall, our basis for guidance, loan growth, net interest margin and charge-offs was to give a range and then also be relatively conservative in terms of the expectations on those ranges. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. And maybe just as a follow-up on the credit side. I mean, you did talk a month ago and then mentioned again today that you expect kind of losses to peak around the middle of the year. How do we think about the performance after that peak? I mean you said kind of flattish. What's driving that? Why isn't that something that improves? And how do we think about reserving in that context? John Greene : Sure. Yes. So there's a couple of different components that are driving that. So if you go back in time, we had about two years of unusually low charge-offs and delinquencies, so from the pandemic. And that process of normalization, typically will take about the same amount of time, two years. The vintages, 2021 and 2022 are seasoning, and that's why we expect it to plateau. The 2023 vintage actually was relatively large, but too early to call whether it's going to outperform our expectations, but certainly, a highly profitable vintage from our vantage point today. So what you're actually just seeing is a period of normalization. My expectation is that charge-offs will plateau and then and beginning in 2025, I would expect those to step down. Now you will know from this past year and the prior year, what we've tried to do in terms of the guidance is the conservative in terms of the range. And throughout 2023, we tightened the range and actually came in at the low end. So my hope is that we'll be able to do the same thing in 2024. Moshe Orenbuch : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Ryan Nash : Hi, good morning, everyone. John, maybe to dig a little bit deeper on some of the commentary you gave regarding loan growth. Maybe just focusing on the account growth. The market clearly thinks there's a better chance of a soft landing right now. We're seeing peers who are talking about mid- to high single-digit growth. And I'm just curious on the account growth. Is this more just conservative underwriting? Are you trying to make sure that you make more progress on risk governance and compliance before you increase growth? Maybe just a little bit more color on why you're seeing such a slowdown in terms of the account growth relative to the last few years? John Greene : Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So our approach in 2023 and then early into 2024 was that we took a look at underwriting and performance of, what I'll say, buckets within our underwriting box. And essentially tightened and we've tightened throughout 2023. What you're seeing here in terms of account growth, at least projections today, is us getting back to 2018 and 2019 levels as we continue to watch the 2022 and 2023 vintage perform. And six months from now, we may end up stepping in a little bit more aggressively. But what we wanted to do certainly was let kind of get further confirmation that the delinquency trends that we have seen in terms of slowing rate of delinquency formation continue to persist and that the charge-offs, the forecasted come in at or better than our expectations. If those two factors are at play, there will be an opportunity to be more aggressive in terms of new account growth. Ryan Nash : Got it. And maybe as my follow-up, can you maybe help us understand where you stand with the student loan sale? And how would you foresee that impacting the outlook as well as capital return over the next four to six quarters? Thank you. John Greene : Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So good news. So it is actually progressing to schedule. So as a matter of fact, last evening, we signed a servicing agreement with [Nelnet] to become the servicer of this portfolio. So that was great news. It was a competitive process. And certainly, Nelnet showed that there's a commitment to continue to dedicate resources and service that portfolio at a high level. The next step will be to continue the servicing migration activities. We expect those activities will take around six months. We're conservatively it may take a month or two longer. And then as we're doing that, our adviser will begin to market the portfolio. So our expectations are that it will sell in the second half. And the implications for the business are as follows : So there's $9.5 billion of receivables. That equates to risk-weighted assets of about $10.8 billion. We expect that, that will be -- the exit of that will be -- have a positive impact on net interest margin by somewhere between 10 bps and 20 bps on a full year basis. Charge-off rate could tick up mildly, so under 5 bps. And as of 12/31, we had $858 million of reserves. So with a successful exit, those reserves will drop. And the sale price, the market will determine that, but we expect it to go above par. Ryan Nash : Thank you for all the color. Operator : Thank you. Your next question will come from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. We're going to start with loan growth also. And I just want to go back to the building blocks a little bit. I think you essentially said in terms of the building blocks, you're expecting payments rates to be elevated ex \u2013 like flat to stay at the elevated level and sales to be flat. You're also adding accounts. So I'm just like trying to understand I guess, what's the bank account? Like how does loan growth stay flat given the sale, you had 15%. I'm just trying to understand like - that's something we're missing, I feel like, and I'm just trying to understand that. John Greene : Yes. So let me try to give a little bit of color that hopefully gets folks comfortable with our view of loan growth today. So in 2023, really, really strong loan growth. Much of that was driven both by new account growth, but also a slowing payment rate, that payment rate in our assumptions is holding flat. And as a result, what we expect to see is the 2023 vintage will begin to kind of build in terms of assets, but there's likely going to be some impact from sales. And then also as we cycle through the 2022 vintage, we're not expecting significant new balance builds from that vintage. Now, maybe there will be. But overall, what we've tried to do here is reflect our view of our underwriting box today, not reflect any potential openings of our underwriting box in the later part of 2023. And if we have deliver on loan growth, that will be fantastic. The other element that has come into play here as we pulled back on balance transfers and promotional balances in the second part of 2023. We don't anticipate significantly increasing that level of balance transfer, promotional balances. Now, if we do, that will certainly be accretive to loan growth as well. So, what you're hearing in the guidance is that our expectation is that there's an opportunity to deliver better. But certainly, we've positioned both the guidance and the business to be conservative at least for the next quarter or two. Mihir Bhatia : Got it. And then I wanted to go back to expenses and the reserve for customer remediation that you mentioned that you took this quarter. Can you just provide some color on that? Like is that related to the merchant mispricing issue? How much was the reserve this quarter? Where does that leave the reserve overall I think you had $365 million in 2Q. Just trying to understand how the estimate for the costs related to that issue changed? I think you also mentioned it could be higher -- expenses would be higher in 2024. If you need to take more reserves there, like -- where are we with that investigation? Just give us an update on that merchant mispricing issue too? John Greene : Yes. Okay. So, let me start with the reserves. So, -- and the remediation reserve that we put up. So, they're unrelated. So, the merchant tiering reserve we booked $365 million as a liability, that has moved now about $370 million just as we've had some payments and other flows in through the interchange that we had to correct manually for. So, the progress there in terms of discussions with our merchants is positive. We'll -- we don't have enough data points to make a material change to that reserve level yet, but it's progressing, my view, positively through the end of the year and today as we speak. Now, separately, we put up $80 million for a -- as we described it, a customer remediation reserve. Now, some context to that is as part of this compliance journey, we've put in a significant number of resources to help us identify and correct issues. And as we prepare the business to continue to move forward to drive organic growth, we're getting much, much better at identifying issues and we identify an issue what we've done here is if we think there's is appropriate to refund customer payments, we're going to do that. So, we identified a particular issue largely within servicing for our student loan business, although there was a general impact in another business line and we continue to look across our business. But the lion's share of that reserve relates to student loans and essentially what we're doing is trying to position the business and that product for a successful exit. Mihir Bhatia : Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Sanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. Good morning. Sorry, multi-part question on the same topic and then a follow-up. Can you update us, John, on the progress made with the regulatory agencies; I think that was sort of alluded to in the previous question. But maybe just the firmness around capital return post CCAR? What exactly happens to the CFPB consent order when the loan servicing is transferred? And then just curious, the loan growth expectations, was that any part driven by any regulatory related matters? Thanks. John Owen : This is John Owen. I'll take part of that, and John Greene will take the capital part. What I would tell you is over the last 18 months or so, we\u2019ve made significant progress improving our risk management and compliance capabilities. We've increased our investments on risk and compliance in 2022 to 2023 up to about a $500 million level. And as John mentioned earlier, we think expense growth, and that will be in the mid-single digits in line with other guidance we've given. We've made improvements in risk and compliance, but we still have quite a bit of work to do. One thing I'd point out, the FDIC consent order, which we did get and was made public, it does not include the misclassification issue in that scope of work. We're working closely with our regulators on that topic and really don't have anything further to add on that topic at this point in time. John Greene : Okay. Sanjay, I feel like your question is a five-part question, but what we'll do our best to answer it. So the loan growth aspect that you asked, it is completely unrelated to any regulatory issues, so nothing to connect on that point. In terms of capital return, our commitment to capital return and capital allocation have not changed. So, first to invest in profitable organic growth; and second, to return excess capital to shareholders. So as we kind of progressed through the fourth quarter, we remained on pause with our buybacks. And given we've got a new CEO coming in, we are contending with a number of different compliance and risk management matters. We got the merchant tiering reserve. We don't have any feedback from our regulators on that point. We decided that it would be most appropriate to remain conservative in terms of our guidance related to buybacks. We will go through CCAR, as I said in my prepared remarks, that will form a view of capital under significant stress as it always does. And then we're going to have the exit or hopefully, the exit from the Student Loan business, which will provide free up at least $2 billion worth of capital. So what you're hearing here hopefully is some indications that one, we're committed to returning excess capital to shareholders; two, that there will be excess capital generated and available; and three, we're going to go through a diligent process internally, share it with our Board and then take the Board's direction in terms of buybacks. Sanjay Sakhrani : The consent order? John Greene : And... Sanjay Sakhrani : With the loan servicing, like does that look\u2026 John Greene : Yes, that was part 5A, I think. Yes. So that remains in effect and our chosen provider, Nelnet is fully aware of the consent order requirements in terms of kind of servicing excellence. And they were chosen because they've got a track record in terms of being able to kind of service a portfolio such as this, and they've dedicated both technology and resources to ensure a seamless transition. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay. Then my follow-up, just question is -- sorry, to my five-part question. Is the reserve rate, Moshe sort of asked about it a little bit, but how should we think about that reserve rate migrating over the course of the year given that the charge-off rate plateaus. Does the reserve rates start coming down? And where does it come down to in a normal environment? I'm just trying to think about how we model that because that's really important. John Greene : Yes, yes. Thanks for that. We are hoping that, that question would come out. So the -- let me talk about the reserves for the quarter, and then I'll give you perspective on 2024 and what could potentially happen there. So we grew receivables in the quarter, $5.7 billion. Now some of that was transactor balances that are reserved light. But one thing that we've been consistent on in terms of our communication is that as we approach peak losses, reserve levels increase. And what we've said previously is, typically, we hit the highest reserve rate level one to two quarters before peak losses. So that's the path we're on. Let me provide some details on some assumptions that were used to set the reserve levels this year at year end. And then I'll give a perspective on what we -- what could happen in 2024. So macro is relatively benign. So unemployment levels, we ended the year at 3.7 what we've assumed is an unemployment level of 4.2. So a mild increase, household worth, mild decrease, savings rate, mild increase and GDP to be in 2024 to be about 1.3%. So relatively conservative, but not overly optimistic of assumptions. Now what will come into play in 2024 is obviously the macros, which will continue to be important. The portfolio performance and -- by the way, it is tracking to our expectations with month-over-month delinquency formation declining. The credit quality of the book remains relatively consistent with what we've done historically. So our expectation is that assuming the macros remain consistent and the portfolio performance remains to our expectation that there will be some level of opportunity to reduce the reserve rate in 2024. Now that's subject to a significant amount of governance, and we're going to make sure that we comply with our internal processes and generally accepted accounting principles. So they're my caveats. But there's a lot of things that are different today than day one. So the step down will be aligned with those points I just mentioned. Sanjay Sakhrani : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. John, I wanted to follow-up on your credit commentary, given that it is such an important area of focus for investors. So you've been saying all along that you didn't move down the credit spectrum, but the concern for many investors had been that other card issuers also experienced outsized growth as we emerge from COVID and they had also experienced some normalization headwinds, but they were now starting to see delinquency reformation start to roll over. As Discover's DQ rate formations as recently as prior months data showed that your formations remain on and up until to the right trajectory. So I guess the question is, does the new disclosure on Slide 14 confirm that your delinquency rate formations are indeed now also starting to roll over? And if so, does that really just reinforce your confidence that we could see peak NCOs hit in 2024, all else equal? John Greene : Yes. And thanks for the question, Bill. So, I just to give you kind of the benefit of some data here. From September through December this year, so the 30-plus delinquencies have declined month-over-month. So in September, we peaked at an increase month-over-month of 26 bps. What we said in the fourth quarter is we expected that to decline. Our October formation increased 20 bps, so relative to decline to the prior month. November, 15 bps, December, 11 bps, and our expectation is that will continue to decline. Where it becomes negative, we're not going to get into that because it will be subject to a number of different things, including kind of our origination path and broad macro. So to get to the essence of your question, we do have a level of confidence regarding kind of what\u2019s happening in the portfolio and the trend. And as we progress in 2024 that will be reflected in hopefully, tightening guidance and then also -- tightening guidance to the lower end and then also, hopefully, reserve rate changes. Bill Carcache : That's helpful. Thank you. And following up on your expense commentary, I believe you said that expenses may need to increase further potentially. Maybe if you could frame the possibility of their being -- what you would view as another step function higher from here? Or how should we think about the risk of further increase in expenses? And how are we -- how should we think about your sustainable long-term efficiency ratio? I think as we look at historically, Discover has been very, very -- lowest efficiency ratio in the industry. To what extent is that still something that we can expect? John Greene : Okay. Yes. Thanks, Bill. So our expectation is that the long-term efficiency ratio will be sub-40%. So there's still a view that, that will happen. The reason we put the -- what I'll call is the caveat in the 2024 expense guidance was a number of different institutions when they've been on this compliance and risk management journey have not been able to call what the actual compliance and risk management spend would be. We had that remediation reserve in the fourth quarter. There were some indications that we might have to put something up for that. But we didn't know. There's still some level of unknowns, unknowns. And I wanted to make sure we're clear to the people listening to this call that, there is some level of risk to the expense guidance. Now that said, 5% on our expense base is a significant amount of dollars. We feel like we have nearly a full complement of resources around risk and compliance today, which is good news. Our issues management capabilities significantly improved. Our path to improving overall governance is certainly on the right trajectory. So those factors give me confidence that we're not going to have a huge surprise. But there could be just don't have enough certainty given where we are on our compliance journey. Now, the rest of the cost base, there's a couple of things to keep in mind here. So right -- today, we have nearly 3,000 resources dedicated to risk and compliance management. A significant amount of those resources are dedicated to issues related to student loan servicing, which with a successful exit and transfer, it will give us an opportunity to scrutinize the cost base in a different way. So that's certainly on the list of planned activities for the second quarter, third quarter, and then hopefully, we begin some execution in the fourth quarter. So overall, I feel comfortable with the expense guidance that we've provided. And we're going to do our best to make sure that every dollar we spend is wise and that the shareholders get the benefit from that. Bill Carcache : Very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. John Greene : You're welcome, Bill Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. Regarding the new $80 million remediation charge, did all of that remediation relate to the student loan business, specifically, and was that in part tied also to the July 2022 disclosure around the student loan issues that surfaced then? And did any of that $80 million relate to the other business that you point that you mentioned that could have had a tangential impact and what was that business? Thanks. John Greene : Yes. So the $80 million was related to servicing issues, the lion's share of that, the significant share of that was related to student loans. There was a small amount that we put up related to personal loans upon reviewing that, there may be an opportunity to release that reserve, very small though. The $80 million is not connected to the issues that we discussed in July. So what I tried to do is provide as much context as I could. So we've dedicated number of resources to identifying issues to help on this consumer compliance journey. As with any company, as you dedicated resources, they come up to speed, they are going to get more effective at identifying issues and correcting issues. This is symptomatic of that progress. So we've got folks that are coming through every single bit of our business to make sure we're executing consumer compliance at a high level. An issue was found. Cross-functional team reviewed it, and we made an election that we are going to accrue something at year-end to cover potential remediation payments. John Pancari : Okay. And just related to that, so this is a newer issue versus what was discussed in July? And is it also newer versus what is in your existing consent order tied to student loans? John Greene : Yes. So what we disclosed in July was a broad program around risk and compliance management activities. The specifics of the particular issues weren't discussed in any details. And what I've shared with you right now is probably as much information as I'm going to share at this point. So the takeaway should be is that we're progressing on the risk and compliance management activities. We're getting better at identifying issues. When we find an issue, we're going to deal with it. And we found an issue. We've put up a reserve for that issue. And we're going to work through further details on it in order to ensure that consumer compliance is where we want it to be. So with that, I think I'll probably close at this particular item out, if you don't mind. John Pancari : No, that's fine. Thank you for that. And my last thing is very quick one on the loan growth guidance. You guided to average balances for 2024 were up modestly. Can you help maybe quantify the up modestly. It could give me -- help frame it. Thanks John Greene : Yes. So 5% to 6% on average. John Pancari : Okay. Great. Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Don Fandetti : John, you know, it's good to see the delinquency formation showing some progress. Can you talk about later stage delinquency rates? I mean, they seem like they're still going up on a year-over-year basis or like our cure rates. I'm still trying to get my arms around this like potentially 5% NCO rate. it just seems high for Discover. John Greene : Yes, the later stage buckets are kind of modestly improving. We're seeing improvements across every bucket. The first bucket is this really the key one, and then as you get into later and later buckets, the ability to cure just becomes more challenging because the situation that consumers and but we are seeing mild improvements there. So that that also is encouraging. Don Fandetti : Okay. And the 2023 vintage, can you talk a little bit about what your early read is on that? John Greene : Yes. The net of it is that it's early. So it's performing profitably, and we're going to continue to keep our eye on it. Don Fandetti : Does that mean it's not really trending that well relative to your expectations? Or is it kind of in line? John Greene : No, no, I didn't say that. It's just -- it's early. So is performing generally in line with expectations. Don Fandetti : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. Jeff Adelson : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. John, I just wanted to kind of follow up on the charge-off guide. I know you've mentioned that you're hopeful this -- your comment at the low end. But could you maybe just dive into what would take us to the low versus the high end here? And if this delinquency formation slowing continues throughout the year, is that kind of what's embedded in your expectation at getting at the low end here? John Greene : Yes. Thank you. Yes. So our baseline is that it's going to come in at the low end. Now I shared the information in terms of the macros that we use for reserves pretty consistent in terms of what we used for our, what I'll say, the second half view of charge-offs. So what could make that worse? Certainly, change to the macros, some servicing issues, which highly unlikely or a miss in terms of forecasting. I'm comfortable with our forecasting team. I'm comfortable with our servicing team and we've got a number of programs, and we've dedicated a lot of dollars in terms of analytics, in terms of call frequency and best time to call, and we've worked on our call scripts to ensure they're compliant but also effective in terms of prioritizing payments. So I feel \u2013 feel good about that. So the range just reflects a level of kind of broad uncertainty that we're going to tighten. Jeff Adelson : Got it. And just as my follow-up, as we think about the NIM guide this year, I know you mentioned you're embedded in an expectation of four rate cuts. If I think about where NIM exited the year though, it feels like the range of rate cuts using your 5 basis points for every 25, it seems like there's more rate cut that embedded in there. Can you maybe just help us understand the drivers is, there may be a little bit more interest accrual reversal going on? And maybe help us understand what you're assuming in positive betas on the way down? Is it going to be a little bit slower than what we've seen in the last four rate cuts on the way up? John Greene : Yes. So good question. So let me start off with 2023 and then the fourth quarter of 2023. So as business, my view is great execution in terms of being able to kind of manage net interest margin, so year-over-year, we're up. I think we're an outlier, and that's from that standpoint in financial services. What we saw in the fourth quarter was cost of funding increased as lower rate CDs term out and higher rate CDs would come in. Our OSA rate remains competitive. And the expectation on beta is that it will be in the mid-70s in a declining rate. And I hope that the beta on the declining rate is higher. Also something that's not baked into the elements of the guidance. But certainly, with the exit of student loans or the proposed exit from the student loan business, that's going to throw a lot of liquidity back into the business. That will give us an opportunity to be slightly more aggressive in terms of deposit pricing. That -- again, that will be a second half activity. So the four rate cuts that we put into the baseline assumption, again, two more than what we had forecasted in December. It could be as many as six, which if it is, that will certainly impact deposit betas and deposit pricing and consequentially net interest margin. So the guide here, I think, is appropriate, perhaps a little conservative. And our baseline expectation is that we're going to deliver to the upper end of the \u2013\u2013 the guidance range. Jeff Adelson : Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Terry Ma with Barclays. Terry Ma : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Maybe I just want to touch on the loan growth guide for 2024 a little bit. Aside from the balance transfers and promos, how much control do you actually have on growth because going from 15% loan growth to 0% just seems like a hard pivot to me. So maybe can you just talk a little bit more about that? And then my second question is just what needs to happen before you can actually grow again, and is there a way to think about what that growth rate looks like as we look out towards 2025 and beyond? Thank you. John Greene : Okay. Thanks Terry. So, I think it's important to take a look at the quarterly trends on loan growth versus the total year because each quarter, what you will see is that the amount of loan growth decreased quarter-over-quarter. And that was partly due to payment rate, partly due to underwriting standards, and partly due to kind of sales activity slowing as well. So, in 2024, we've guided to loan growth to be flat. Again, payment rate is 100 basis points higher than it was in 2019. That could be a positive if it holds where it ended the year, it's not going to impact loan growth. So, I feel like what we've tried to do here is put something on the table that's reasonable that doesn't reflect a level of undue risk taking in a time where consumer behavior is actually changing relatively dynamically. If you think back 2.5 years ago coming out of the pandemic to kind of where it is today and also the impact of inflation that hit certainly all consumers, but certainly in terms of our prime revolver -- consumers, the lower -- third of those consumers were impacted fairly significantly by inflation. So, we do want to kind of watch, as I said previously, watch delinquency formations and our other metrics before we press on the gas on generating high level of new accounts in 2024. Terry Ma : Thanks. And is there a way to think about what growth would look like before when you reaccelerate? John Greene : Yes, I would go back to kind of historical growth rates. The companies typically delivered somewhere between 3% and 8% year-over-year growth. And then we feel like our underwriting and credit and the opportunity to lend profitably at a rate higher than that, we will do that. So what -- an important thing for our investors to remember is we seek to generate high returns over the short, mid and long-term. And that's essentially what this plan is seeking to deliver. Eric Wasserstrom : So, Todd, I think we have time for one more, please. Operator : Thank you, sir. We'll go next to John Hecht with Jefferies. John Hecht : Morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I know you've answered a lot on credit, so I apologize for one more. But your 2018 and 2019 charge-off levels were in the low 3% range. And I think we -- we've all kind of said that was a good environment, but a relatively normal environment. You're guiding toward a high -- relatively higher, closer to 5% charge-off rate this year despite low unemployment. I know you kind of called out the 2022 vintage is something to think about there. But maybe can you talk about the attribution of the difference in charge-off rates between that period and now? I think the kind of -- the reason for the question is just to give us a sort of level of understanding of where we are in the credit cycle and give us comfort that things will stabilize, if not improve from here? John Greene : Yes, happy to, John. So, a few points. So, we're in a significantly different environment today than we were back in 2018 and 2019. So, we're coming off of two years of abnormally low losses, so sub 2%. We had an incredibly high payment rate in -- going back two years ago, that is normalized. What we're seeing is that consumers had significant amount of savings. Those savings levels have been depleted. You had a spending pattern with the consumers across the Board that was reflecting kind of pent-up demand. And as savings rate came down, the consumers needed to adjust their spending patterns. Some did successfully, some not. And then you're also seeing inflation, if you go back 1.5 years or two years ago, inflation significantly outpacing wage growth. And that put certainly the lower quartile of the consumers in a significant amount of stress and that's across all sectors of the economy. So not specifically to our prime revolver segment. And on top of that, you also had in '21 and '22, two very large vintages. And so you put all those together, what naturally is going to happen is you're going to have charge-offs. What I'll say is peak before they normalize back to levels that you're accustomed to seeing from Discover. So my sense is that given real wage growth, our consumers will end up in, frankly, a better spot in '24 and '25 than they were in '22 and '23. And our charge-off forecast and reserves reflect a view that the consumers will manage through this and delinquency formation will continue to slow. So anyway, I hope that -- hopefully, this color is helpful. John Hecht : That's super helpful. And maybe could you give us a sense of the charge-offs by product or maybe like the -- is the mix going to be consistent with historical mixes just to give us a sense from a modeling perspective? John Greene : Yes. The only piece of information I'm going to give is in the fourth quarter, we expect student loan charge-offs to be significantly lower because we\u2019re exiting. John Hecht : Thank you. Eric Wasserstrom : All right. Well, I think we're going to conclude the call there. Thank you for joining us. I know there was a few of you still in queue, who we didn't get to, but feel free to reach out to the IR team. We'll be around all day and available to answer additional questions. Thanks for joining us, and have a great day. Operator : And this does conclude today's Discover Financial Services earnings conference call. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Todd, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2024 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, there will be no question-and-answer period after this morning's prepared remarks. After the call ends, questions should be directed to the Discover Investor Relations team. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you, and welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin by referencing Slides 2 and 3 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financial section of our Investor Relations website investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our first quarter 2024 earnings press release and presentation as well as the risk factors detailed in our annual report and other filings with the SEC. Our call today will include remarks from our Interim CEO, Michael Shepherd; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. There will be no question-and-answer session following today's remarks. However, the Investor Relations team will be available for any inquiries. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael. Michael Shepherd : Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining today's call. I'd like to begin the call with a few words of introduction. I joined Discover's Board in August of 2023 after a career in the public and private sectors, more than 30 years of which were in the financial services industry. Among other roles, I served as Senior Deputy Controller of the Currency earlier in my career. Most relevant to my current position, I was Chairman and CEO of BancWest Corporation and Bank of the West. As Chairman of Bank of the West, I helped oversee its acquisition and integration into the Bank of Montreal in 2023. I hope my experience will help me serve our shareholders customers and employees as an effective leader during this important period. John Greene will discuss the results of the first quarter in greater detail, but let me highlight a few aspects of our financial performance. Discover's operating performance remained solid with increased revenues in the period, driven by good loan growth, largely reflecting payment rate normalization and a resilient net interest margin. We are seeing receivables expansion while remaining prudent in our underwriting and disciplined in customer acquisition. Credit continues to perform in line with our expectations and delinquency formation has stabilized as we had anticipated. Importantly, we continue to strengthen our risk management and compliance programs where we are investing in meaningful resources. In the first quarter, following continuing internal reviews, and after extensive discussions with several constituencies, including merchants and regulators, Discover decided to significantly increase our liability for the card misclassification issue. We believe that taking this action will advance the resolution of these issues. There's been a lot of change at Discover over the last few months and I thought it might be helpful to emphasize our framework for decision-making. Our goals are to maximize shareholder value by executing on our risk management and compliance priorities, sustaining our commitment to outstanding customer service and seeing that the company remains well positioned to drive long-term value creation. As the interim CEO of Discover, I'm committed to these objectives, which will improve our company and allow us to make the strongest contribution to the combined Capital One. The Capital One team is leading the integration planning process and we look forward to partnering with our colleagues in support of our shared objectives. The process has achieved the first important milestone, the submission of the merger applications to the Federal Reserve and the OCC. We continue to believe that the strategic rationale, operating scale and economics of the combined company are compelling. The merger will advance the company's shared mission to help our customers meet their financial goals support our commitments to our communities and make the combined company a well-positioned bank and a competitive payments network of the future. Finally, I'd like to thank Michael Rhodes for his leadership through an important phase. His new position allows him to fulfill his career goal of leading a public company and my colleagues and I wish him well. With that, I'll now ask John Greene to review our first quarter 2024 financial results. John Greene : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our summary financial results on Slide 5. In the quarter, we reported net income of $308 million, which was down 68% from the prior year quarter. Impacting our operating results was a $799 million increase to our reserve for remediation related to the card misclassification issue. The decision to increase the reserve was based upon, among other factors, the company's experience to date with remediation efforts, regulatory dialogue and our pending merger with Capital One. As Michael indicated, we believe this action is aligned with our compliance and risk management objectives and will significantly help advance the resolution of this issue. Our core financial performance remains strong. Key highlights for the quarter include double-digit revenue expansion from loan growth, a resilient net interest margin strong consumer deposit growth and credit performance consistent with our view that losses will peak and plateau in mid to late 2024. Excluding the card misclassification remediation reserve increase, we would have reported net income of approximately $915 million, EPS of about $3.50 per share and an efficiency ratio under 36%. These figures indicate a strong start to 2024. Let us review the details beginning on Slide 6. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 11.03%, down 31 basis points from the prior year and up 5 basis points sequentially. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, expanding loan yields from a lower card promotional balance mix and payment rate moderation were partially offset by higher net funding costs. Receivable growth is slowing from its peak in the first quarter of 2023, but continues to be strong. Card receivables increased 11% year-over-year due to a lower payment rate and contribution from prior year new account growth. The payment rate declined about 20 basis points from the sequential quarter and is now about 70 basis points above 2019 levels. Discover card sales were down 1% compared to the prior year quarter. Sales slowed across categories with the largest decline occurring in the everyday category, which includes supermarkets, gas and wholesale clubs. While we continue to add new accounts, in general, we are seeing card members spend less, particularly among lower-income households which are most impacted by the cumulative effects of inflation. Based on trends in the period, we expect sales to be flat to slightly negative this year. Personal loans were up 21%, driven by continued strength in originations and lower payment rates versus the prior year. We are seeing strong uptake on our offering as higher interest rates in card can make debt consolidation more appealing for Summit consumers. Approximately 50% of our first quarter originations and personal loans were utilized for debt consolidation with disbursements primarily made directly to creditors. Student loans were flat year-over-year. As previously announced, we stopped accepting applications for new student loans on February 1. We formally launched the sales process in mid-March and several thousand potential buyers have provided an initial indication of interest. We continue to anticipate strong demand and still target a closing date late in the third quarter or fourth quarter. Average deposits were up 18% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Our direct-to-consumer balances grew $3 billion in the period. We have started to decrease pricing on our deposit products ahead of any potential moves in reference rates. This is consistent with our practice of leading the industry on pricing in the down part of the cycle and this action contributed to our strong NIM performance in the quarter. Looking at other revenue on Slide 7. Noninterest income increased $113 million or 19%. This was primarily driven by higher net discount and interchange revenue, an increase in loan fee income and higher transaction processing revenue from our PULSE business. PULSE continued to grow at a healthy clip as debit volume increased by $13.8 billion or 21% year-over-year. Our rewards rate was 139 basis points in the period, a decrease of 2 basis points versus the prior year quarter. The decline reflects lower cash back match from slowing new account growth and the active management of our 5% categories. Prior to reviewing expenses, I would like to briefly comment on the CFPB late fee proposal. We continue to closely monitor the legal process around the proposal. If the rule were to be implemented, on an annualized basis, we estimate a pretax reduction of around $600 million or approximately 4% of revenues. Moving to expenses on Slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $926 million or 67% year-over-year. As mentioned, the predominant driver of this growth was the increase to our remediation reserve. Absent this, our expenses would have increased 9% year-over-year. Looking at our major expense categories. Compensation costs increased $46 million or 7% due to an increase in business technology resources and severance related to organizational changes including the wind down of our student loan business. Professional fees were up $60 million or 26%, driven by continued investments in compliance and risk management initiatives higher recovery fees and merger-related expenses. Information processing increased due to technology investments. Our expectation for compliance and risk management expenses for the year excluding remediation-related costs, remains in the $500 million range with an upside bias. Moving to credit performance on Slide 9. Total net charge-offs were 4.92%, 220 basis points higher than the prior year and up 81 basis points from the prior quarter. In Card, as we anticipated, delinquency formation is improving as more recent vintages season. The 30-plus day delinquency rate was down 4 basis points versus the prior quarter. From a vintage perspective, our 2023 card vintage is performing relatively in line with our 2022 vintage. Both vintages remain profitable and above our return thresholds. This performance has been contemplated in our full year net charge-off guidance. We executed some incremental tightening during the first quarter, which will influence our new account growth for the year. Personal loan net charge-offs were 4.02%, 208 basis points higher than the prior year and up 63 basis points from the prior quarter. We expect losses in this product to trend higher in the near term before plateauing beginning late this year or into 2025. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. Our credit reserve balances declined $25 million from the prior quarter, and our reserve rate increased by 9 basis points to 7.32%. The reserve rate increase was primarily driven by the reduction of seasonal transactor balances in the quarter. Given our expectation for total company losses to peak and plateau in mid- to late 2024 and we believe the credit reserve rate is likely at or near peak levels, assuming a stable macroeconomic environment and no significant unexpected changes in portfolio performance. Looking at Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 10.9%, down 40 basis points sequentially. The impacts from the increase in expenses in the CECL phase-in were offset by lower receivables and core earnings generation. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock. Concluding on Slide 12. We have made the following updates to our 2024 outlook. We are increasing our loan growth expectations to up low single digits. This primarily reflects our expectation of further decline in the payment rates, offsetting our view of flat to slightly negative sales growth this year and a modest contribution from new accounts. We are increasing our net interest margin range to 10.7% to 11%. This change was driven by 2 factors : first, the forward curve now reflects an expectation of 2 rate cuts this year versus our prior forecast of 4 cuts. And second, we have been proactive in lowering our deposit rates. Our cumulative deposit beta is now about 70%, and we think there will be further opportunities to manage our deposit costs over the course of this year. We still expect our core operating expenses to be up mid-single digits, excluding card misclassification related costs and merger expenses. Our core operating expense trends are in line with our expectations and we believe the actions we took in the first quarter have substantially de-risked the probability of further increases to the remediation reserve. We are tightening our net charge-off range to 4.9% to 5.2%, based largely on current delinquency trends. Our base case remains at the lower end of the range. Finally, given the merger agreement, we have suspended share repurchases through closing and agreed not to increase the dividend. To summarize, we continue to generate solid results and our financial performance underscores our steady stewardship of the organization as we move towards resolving compliance items and consummating our planned merger. This concludes our remarks. I'll turn the call back over to our operator. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's call. The Discover Investor Relations team will be available for questions.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Todd, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2024 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note, there will be no question-and-answer period after this morning's prepared remarks. After the call ends, questions should be directed to the Discover Investor Relations team. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Eric Wasserstrom, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you, and welcome to this morning's call. I'll begin by referencing Slides 2 and 3 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the financial section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in the second quarter 2024 earnings press release and presentation as well as the risk factors detailed in our annual report and other filings with the SEC. Our call today will include remarks from our Interim CEO, Michael Shepherd; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. There will be no question-and-answer session following today's remarks. However, the Investor Relations team will be available for any inquiries. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael. Michael Shepherd : Thank you, Eric. Good morning, and welcome to our guests who have joined today's call. Discover's second quarter operating performance was very good, and we advanced several strategic priorities. Let me highlight a few of these accomplishments. On July 17, we entered into an agreement to sell our private student loan portfolio to affiliates and limited partners of Carlyle and KKR. Firstmark, a division of Nelnet will assume responsibility for servicing the portfolio upon sale. This agreement represents an important milestone in our journey to simplify our operations and business mix. The completion of the sale also has financial implications, which John Greene will detail in a few moments. As we continue to resolve past issues and strengthen our risk management and compliance posture, we have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the merchant class actions associated with the card misclassification litigation, subject to court approval. The decision to settle was based upon our internal reviews, extensive dialogue with key constituencies, including merchants and regulators and our pending merger with Capital One. The settlement agreement would resolve claims by parties affected by the card misclassification, including merchants, acquirers and intermediaries. Our current remediation reserve is sufficient to cover the expenses under the terms of the settlement agreement. Our results also benefited from a litigation settlement in our Payment Services segment, where Discover was the plaintiff. We are happy to have this matter resolved and are satisfied with the favorable financial outcome. Finally, turning to our pending merger with Capital One. Capital One continues to lead the integration planning process, and the teams are working well together on integration planning and regulatory applications. Upcoming merger-related milestones include a virtual public hearing hosted by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, the completion of the written comment period, an in-person public hearing with the Delaware State Bank Commissioner and the filing of the definitive merger proxy. We expect shareholder votes to occur this fall. We are encouraged by how the merger planning and application processes are progressing and continue to believe that the strategic rationale, operating scale and economics of the combined company are compelling. With that, I'll now ask John Greene to review our second quarter 2024 financial results. John Greene : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our summary financial results on Slide 5. In the quarter, we reported net income of $1.5 billion, which was up 70% from the prior year quarter. Our fundamental performance in the period was driven by revenue expansion from loan growth, higher net interest margin and non-interest revenue growth. Credit continues to perform in line with expectations, supporting our view that losses are near peak and will plateau during the second half of 2024. There are several unusual items which impacted the quarter. These included a $869 million student loan reserve release, a gain of $26 million from the sale of our Lake Park facility. And largely offsetting one another were the favorable litigation settlement and a charge for expected regulatory penalties related to the card misclassification matter. Excluding unusual items, we would have reported net income of approximately $915 million and EPS of about $3.63 per share. Let's review the details beginning on Slide 6. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 11.17%, up 11 basis points from the prior year and up 14 basis points sequentially. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, margin expansion was primarily driven by a lower card promotional balance mix. As anticipated, receivable growth continues to normalize from its early 2023 peak. Card receivables increased 7% year-over-year due to a lower payment rate and a smaller contribution from new accounts. The payment rate declined about 130 basis points compared to last year and is now about 90 basis points above 2019 levels. Discover card sales were down 3% compared to the prior year, spending at restaurants, which is a large category for sales volume declined sequentially as a result of being included in the 5% promotion during the first quarter. Accounting for the influence of promotional categories, sales trends are relatively stable. We continue to see a cautious consumer, evidenced by less card member spend with lower income households being most affected. Personal loans were up 13% from the prior year period. In response to market conditions, we prudently tightened underwriting over the past year, which has served to modestly reduced originations. Student loans were down 1% year-over-year. As Michael mentioned, we have entered into an agreement to sell our student loan portfolio. We expect the transaction to be completed in four tranches by the end of 2024. The purchase price has added a premium to the principal balance and is based on a formula that varies depending on the closing timing, interest rates and other factors. In association with this development, student loans are now accounted for as held for sale. The two most notable impacts to the financial statements are that we will no longer maintain a credit reserve for student loans and future student loan net charge-offs will be recognized through operating expense rather than credit losses. Average consumer deposits were up 15% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Deposit balances are being managed in relation to our liquidity needs, which will benefit from the student loan sale. Our disciplined approach to deposit pricing has led to a modest reduction in average deposit rates in the second quarter, consistent with our practice of leading the industry on pricing in down parts of the cycle. Looking at other revenue on Slide 7. Non-interest income increased $313 million or 45%. Discount and interchange revenue was up $67 million as a result of lower rewards cost. Our rewards rate was 132 basis points in the period, a decrease of 10 basis points versus the prior year quarter. The decline reflects lower cash back match. Other income increased due to unusual items, including the litigation settlement and the facility sale. On an adjusted basis, non-interest revenue grew 14%. Moving to expenses on Slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $325 million or 23% year-over-year. The most significant driver of this increase was a charge for expected regulatory penalties related to the card misclassification issue. It is important to note that actual penalties imposed are subject to further discussions and may be more or less than this amount. Adjusting for this charge, our expenses would have increased by 9% year-over-year. Looking at our major expense categories. Compensation costs increased $70 million or 12%, primarily due to an increase in business technology resources. Professional fees were up $80 million or 37%, driven by higher recovery fees and investments in compliance and risk management. Our expectation for compliance and risk management expenses for the full year remains in the $500 million range with an upside bias. This figure excludes cards misclassification related costs. Moving to credit performance on Slide 9. Total net charge-offs were 4.83%, 161 basis points higher than the prior year and down 9 basis points from the prior quarter. In card, delinquency formation improvement continued. The 30-plus day delinquency rate was down 14 basis points versus the prior quarter. From a vintage perspective, our 2023 card vintage continues to perform in line with our 2022 vintage. As we look into the second half of the year, we expect there could be some variability in monthly card losses from both seasonality and various credit management actions we've taken. This has not changed our broader outlook for losses to generally peak and plateau this year. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. Our credit reserve balances declined $777 million from the prior quarter, reflecting the student loan reserve release, partially offset by a $92 million reserve build primarily to support loan growth. Our reserve rate was just over 7.2%, largely unchanged after adjusting for student loans. Looking at Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 11.9%, up 100 basis points, bolstered by core earnings generation and the reserve release. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock. Concluding on Slide 12. We have revised our 2024 outlook and having included the impacts of the pending student loan sale. We are updating our loan growth expectations to be down low single digits, reflecting the roughly $10 billion asset sale. Absent this, year-over-year loan growth would be consistent with our prior view. We are increasing our net interest margin range to 11.1% to 11.4%. This change was driven by two factors. We now anticipate higher card yields reflecting a lower promotional balance mix and the student loan sale, which increases NIM by about 10 basis points. Our operating expense guidance is unchanged, notwithstanding the inclusion of the student loan net charge-offs in this line item. Our base case for net charge-offs remains at the low end of the 4.9% to 5.2% range. This includes the 10-basis points impact from student loans. And finally, our capital management expectations have not changed. To summarize, we continue to generate solid financial results, remain steadfast in our efforts to resolve compliance matters and look forward to consummating our planned merger. This concludes our remarks. I'll turn the call back over to the operator. Operator :",

    "content": "\ufeff Erin Stieber : Thank you, and welcome to this morning's call. By way of introduction, I'm Erin Stieber, Senior Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations. Eric Wasserstrom has decided to pursue an opportunity outside the company. We appreciate his contributions to the Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy programs over the past four years and wish him well. I'm excited for this new opportunity and look forward to getting to know all of you over the coming months. I'll begin by referencing Slides 2 and 3 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our third quarter 2024 earnings press release and presentation, as well as the risk factors detailed in our annual report and other filings with the SEC. Our call today will include remarks from our Interim CEO, Michael Shepherd, and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. There will be no question-and-answer session following today's remarks; however, the Investor Relations team will be available for any inquiries. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael. Michael Shepherd : Thank you, Erin. Good morning, and welcome to today's call. Discover's financial performance remained strong in the third quarter, and we continue to advance our critical strategic priorities of driving business results, strengthening risk management and compliance, and planning for the merger with Capital One. We've made significant progress on the execution of the sale of the private student loan portfolio, successfully completing the first of four closings. Additionally, earlier this month, we completed the sale of the second tranche. As we near the end of our student loan disposition journey, we look forward to realizing the benefits of a more focused business model. John will review the details of the sale a bit later in the call. Our risk management and compliance capabilities continue to advance. We are seeing improved results from new programs, which focus on reducing risk and preventing customer harm. Our organization is driven by our commitment to customers, communities and employees. And as part of our culture, we reinforce ethical decision making and customer service through strengthened governance and controls. Discover ranked #2 in customer satisfaction among U.S. credit card issuers by J.D. Power for the fifth consecutive year. We are glad to report that this marks an 18-year run of being ranked either first or second. We recently reached two important milestones in our community-based facilities strategy. First, we celebrated the grand opening of our Whitehall, Ohio customer care and community center, marking a significant investment in the region. Second, we achieved 1,000 active jobs in the Chatham neighborhood of Chicago, fulfilling our three-year commitment. We are proud to create valuable jobs and offer free access to state-of-the-art facilities in the communities where we operate. Our employees are a key reason for our success and our award-winning customer service. We are very pleased that employee engagement remains high, attrition is relatively low, and we continue to be recognized as a great place to work. Discover was ranked #16 by Fortune for Best Large Workplaces in Financial Services and Insurance, and was also recognized as a 2024 Best Place to Work for People with Disabilities. Shifting attention to our pending merger, Capital One continues to lead merger-related activities, with applications currently under regulatory review. Integration planning is advancing well. With that, I'll now ask John Greene to review our third quarter 2024 financial results. John Greene : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our summary financial results on Slide 5. In the quarter, we reported net income of $965 million, which was up 41% from the prior year. Financial performance was strong, driven by : revenue growth from modestly higher loan balances; net interest margin expansion; we recognized a gain from the first closing of the private student loan portfolio sale; and credit is performing in line with expectations with net charge-offs plateauing. Let's review the details beginning on Slide 6. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 11.38%, up 43 basis points from the prior year and up 21 basis points sequentially. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, margin expansion was primarily driven by a lower card promotional balance mix. Card receivables increased 3% year-over-year due to a lower payment rate, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume. The payment rate declined around 100 basis points from last year, was stable versus the prior quarter and is approximately 70 basis points above pre-pandemic levels. Discover card sales were down 3% compared to the prior year. Sales were impacted by cautious consumer behavior and credit tightening actions, which began in 2022. We expect these dynamics to persist for the remainder of the year. Personal loans were up 9% from the prior year. We continue to see strong demand from consumers seeking debt consolidation. The average FICO for new personal loan accounts is above 750. Student loans were down 19% year-over-year as a result of the first student loan asset sale. We recognized a gain of $70 million in the quarter. As Michael mentioned, shortly after the quarter ended, we completed the sale of the second tranche. Approximately 55% of the portfolio has been sold to date. We expect to sell the remaining portions of the portfolio by mid-November. Average consumer deposits were up 11% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. We are managing deposit balances to meet our liquidity needs and we have benefited from the student loan sale. We anticipate a through-the-cycle beta of around 70%. Looking at other revenue on Slide 7. Non-interest income increased $76 million or 11%. Other income increased due to the gain from the loan sale. Loan fee revenue was up $20 million, driven by higher instances. Our rewards rate was 144 basis points in the period, an increase of 2 basis points versus the prior-year quarter and up 12 basis points sequentially. The increases were driven by changes in the promotional categories. During the third quarter of 2024, consumers enjoyed higher rewards with Grocery and Walmart spend earning 5%. Moving to expenses on Slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $238 million or 16% year-over-year. Looking at our major expense categories, compensation costs increased $128 million or 22%, primarily due to higher wage rates and employee retention awards. Information processing increased as a result of technology investment and accelerated student loan software depreciation. And professional fees were up $42 million or 15%, driven by higher recovery fees and merger and integration cost. We recognized $43 million of merger and integration planning cost in the quarter, $65 million year-to-date, and anticipate about $125 million for the full year 2024, spread across multiple expense categories. We expect total risk management and compliance expense of approximately $550 million in 2024, excluding card misclassification costs. Moving to credit performance on Slide 9. Total net charge-offs were 4.86%, 134 basis points higher than the prior year and up 3 basis points from the prior quarter. Adjusting for the impact of reclassifying private student loans to held-for-sale, the total net charge-off rate would have declined 20 basis points. In card, net charge-offs declined 27 basis points from the prior quarter, outperforming seasonality. 30-plus-day delinquency formation increased in line with seasonal trends. The 2023 card vintage continues to perform in line with the 2022 vintage and remains highly profitable. An early look at the 2024 vintage suggests improvements compared to 2022 and 2023. Personal loan net charge-offs and delinquencies ticked up modestly, but are well within historical norms and vintages are meeting profitability targets. We continue to see a stable yet cautious consumer. The labor markets remain strong and wages are growing. However, households are contending with inflation and the impacts on everyday living expenses. Spend per card member is returning to a more normal level. Slower, stable spending indicates that households have adjusted spending patterns to manage their budgets, which is beneficial from a credit standpoint. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. Our credit reserve balance increased $31 million from the prior quarter as a result of loan growth. The reserve rate was 7.18%, down 4 basis points from the prior quarter, driven by our credit performance and modest improvements in the forecast for household net worth and debt service burden. Our economic outlook assumes year-end 2024 unemployment of 4.4%, with peak unemployment at 4.6%, and GDP in the 1% to 3% range. Looking at Slide 11, our common equity tier 1 ratio for the period was 12.7%, up 80 basis points, supported by core earnings and the student loan sale. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock. Before we discuss our revised view of 2024, I would like to provide a brief regulatory update. As part of its review of the joint proxy statement and prospectus, the staff of the SEC has indicated that they disagree with certain aspects of Discover's accounting approach for the card misclassification matter. We are working diligently to resolve their comments, which largely focus on the allocation of previously incurred card misclassification charges between revenue and expense. We do not anticipate resolution of this matter to have an impact to cumulative historical earnings, capital or our counterparty restitution plan liability. Concluding on Slide 12, we have revised our 2024 outlook to reflect our latest view. We are updating our loan growth expectations to down low- to mid-single-digits. This change is driven by a higher-than-anticipated payment rate and slightly lower card sales. Excluding the student loan sale, loans are estimated to grow low-single-digits. We are tightening our net interest margin range to 11.2% to 11.4%. Our operating expense guidance is unchanged. We are tightening our range of net charge-offs to 4.9% to 5%, reflecting our improved credit performance. Our capital management expectations have not changed. In summary, we continue to deliver strong financial results, prudently manage our business, and prepare for our merger with Capital One. This concludes our remarks. I'll turn the call back over to the operator. Operator : Thank you. Today's call has ended. The Discover Investor Relations team will be available for your questions. Thank you for joining.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Madison, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter 2024 Discover Financial Services Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mrs. Erin Stieber. Please go ahead. Erin Stieber : Thank you, operator. I'll begin by referencing Slides 2 and 3 of our earnings presentation, which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website, investorrelations.discover.com. Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that appear in our fourth quarter 2024 earnings press release and presentation, as well as the risk factors detailed in our annual report and other filings with the SEC. Our call today will include remarks from our Interim CEO and President, Michael Shepherd; and John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer. There will be no question-and-answer session following today's remarks. However, the Investor Relations team will be available for any inquiries. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michael. Michael Shepherd : Thank you, Erin. Good morning, and welcome to today's call. 2024 was a good and transformative year for Discover. When assuming the role of Interim CEO last April, I shared that our top goals were operating the company profitably and safely, continuing to strengthen our risk management and compliance, sustaining our commitment to outstanding customer service and preparing for the successful completion of our merger with Capital One. I'm happy to report today that we've made considerable progress on each of these goals. We reported net income of $4.5 billion for the full year 2024 and a earnings per share of $17.72, reflecting several factors. On a full-year basis, we grew average loans, expanded our deposit base and benefited from a higher net interest margin. We also successfully completed the sale of our private student loan portfolio, which provided financial benefits and streamlined our business model. As we anticipated in our commentary, delinquency formation and net charge-offs began to improve. And despite a modest slowdown in US card sales, overall network volume increased driven by growth in our PULSE business and demonstrating the strength of our payments network. We continued to invest heavily in risk management and compliance in 2024, and we are seeing meaningful improvements in our programs. Additionally, we've made progress on meeting regulatory requirements and toward fully resolving the card misclassification matter. Throughout the pursuit of these goals, we remain steadfast in our commitment to customers and employees, evidenced by the customer satisfaction and workplace award recognitions we have received. Each of these successes positions us well for our pending merger. Capital One received approval of the merger from the Delaware State Bank Commissioner and our definitive merger proxy has been transmitted to shareholders in connection with the upcoming shareholder votes. Integration planning efforts are progressing well in preparation for a smooth transition. We continue to firmly believe the merger will advance our company's shared mission to help our customers meet their financial goals, support the communities in which we operate and create value for our shareholders. With that, I'll now ask John Greene to provide an update on our fourth quarter financial results. John Greene : Thank you, Michael. I'll start with our summary financial results on Slide 5. In the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $1.3 billion versus $366 million in the same-period last year. These results were driven by three main factors. First, provision expense declined by $707 million. This was largely from a reduction in our credit reserve balance compared to a reserve build one year ago. Second, as Michael mentioned, we successfully completed the sale of our student loan portfolio, which resulted in a gain of $381 million. The transaction in total provided an earnings benefit of $1.3 billion, including the reserve reduction of $869 million recognized in the second quarter. And third, net interest income grew $162 million from continued net interest margin expansion. In connection with finalizing the merger proxy, we restated financial results for the periods dated back to 2021, reflecting a reclassification of amounts related to the card tiering accrual. Furthermore, an independent review identified approximately $60 million of incremental charges related to the card product misclassification and we increased our accrual for potential regulatory penalties by $90 million in the third quarter. Both are incorporated in our revised results. Accounting for these updates, the cumulative impact on equity was a decrease of $151 million, earnings for 2024 increased by $441 million. Back to the detailed results beginning with revenue on Slide 6. Our net interest margin ended the quarter at 11.96%, up 98 basis points from the prior year and up 58 basis points sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by product mix, investment of sales proceeds and a lower card promotional balance mix. Card receivables increased 1% year-over-year due to a slightly lower payment rate, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume. The payment rate declined around 10 basis points from last year, was down 20 basis points sequentially and is approximately 90 basis points above pre-pandemic levels. Over the past several quarters, payment rates have stabilized. Discover card sales were down 3% compared to the prior year. The decline in card sales is primarily due to credit tightening actions, which began in 2022. Holiday sales were strong and we currently see an opportunity to increase new account acquisition in the coming year. This is expected to provide a modest boost to 2025 sales with more substantial benefits expected in 2026. Personal loans were up 5% from the prior year. Demand remained strong and we continue to take a conservative approach to underwriting. Total loans after adjusting for the student loan sale increased 3%. Average consumer deposits were up 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Deposit growth, driven by industry-leading products, customer experience and our value proposition has enabled us to improve our funding mix. Direct-to-consumer deposits now account for 72% of total funding, bringing us within our targeted range of 70% to 80%. We continue to manage deposit balances to meet our liquidity needs and anticipate a through-the-cycle beta of around 70%. Looking at other revenue on Slide 7, non-interest income increased $417 million or 59%. Other income increased as a result of the successful student loan exit. Net discount and interchange revenue was up $45 million due to increased cashback debit volume and lower rewards. The rewards rate was 135 basis points in the period, a decrease of 2 basis points driven by lower cashback match, which was largely offset by an increase in 5% rewards. Sequentially, the reward rate is down 9 basis points from changes in the promotional category. Moving to expenses on Slide 8. Total operating expenses were up $67 million or 4% year-over-year. Looking at our major expense categories, compensation costs increased $146 million or 23%, primarily due to higher wages and benefits and proactive employee retention actions. Marketing costs declined $73 million in the quarter due to timing of broad market advertising. Information processing increased as a result of technology investments and a $22 million write-off pertaining to our student loan infrastructure. Professional fees were up $51 million or 16%. This increase was driven by approximately $44 million of merger and integration costs and loan sale expenses. We recognized $588 million of risk management and compliance expense in addition to card misclassification costs and $118 million of merger and integration expense in 2024. Moving to credit performance on Slide 9. Total net charge-offs were 4.64%, 53 basis points higher than the prior year and down 22 basis points from the prior quarter. On a full year basis, net charge-offs ended at 4.8%, slightly better than our guided range. In card, net charge-offs declined 25 basis points from the prior quarter and the 30-plus day delinquency rate was flat. This marks the third consecutive quarter the card net charge-off rate has declined. The 2023 card vintage is maturing and is now expected to modestly outperform the 2022 vintage. We are seeing improvements across the portfolio. Personal loan net charge-offs and delinquencies continue to be within historical norms. Increases reflect the seasoning of recent growth. Our view on the consumer has not changed. We continue to observe a stable consumer supported by wage growth and a resilient labor market, providing a foundation for sales and credit headed into 2025. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10. Our credit reserve balance decreased $189 million from the prior quarter. The reserve rate was 6.87%, down 31 basis points, driven by our credit performance, improvement in household net worth and an increase in seasonal transactor balances. Absent seasonal balances, the reserve rate would have declined by about 20 basis points. In terms of the macroeconomic outlook, our expectations for unemployment and GDP are relatively unchanged from last quarter. We now assume peak unemployment of 4.7%, up 10 basis points. Our GDP forecast remains in the 1% to 3% range. Looking at Slide 11, our Common Equity Tier-1 ratio for the period was 14.1%, up 160 basis points compared to the prior quarter, supported by the student loan sale and core earnings generation. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share of common stock. Including on Slide 12, given the pending merger, we will not provide numerical guidance. However, I'd like to provide some insights on trends for 2025. We anticipate loan growth to align more closely with pre-pandemic norms. Tailwinds from declining payment rates appear to have largely subsided. Sales and new account generation should play a larger role in driving growth than in the recent past. We expect net interest margin to remain relatively consistent with the fourth quarter level, although an increase in new account generation may create some margin pressure in the back-half of the year. Mitigating factors include declining deposit rates and our improved funding mix. We have not contemplated any significant changes to our expense base prior to merger approval. Previously, we had shared the expectation for net charge-offs to peak and plateau. We are beginning to see a downward trend. To summarize, our strong fourth quarter results brought an excellent close to 2024. In 2025, we will continue to invest in actions that drive sustainable long-term value and prepare for the consummation of our pending merger with Capital One. This concludes our remarks. I'll turn the call back over to the operator. End of Q&A: Today's call has ended. The Discover Investor Relations team will be available for questions. Thank you for joining.
